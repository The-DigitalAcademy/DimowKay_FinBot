- source_sentence: What are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations?
  sentences:
  - If the person gifting the property owed any debt to Canada Revenue Agency on the
    date of gift, you may getting a nice letter from Canada Revenue Agency advising
    you to settle the donors tax liability with the property gifted.
  - Simple math 502525, hence decline from 50 to 25 is a 50 decline you lose half,
    while an advance from 25 to 50 is 100 gain you gain 100, double your 25 to 50.
    Their point is that if you have more upswings than downswings  youll gain more
    on long positions during upswings than on short positions during downswings on
    average. Again  simple math.
  - My gut is to say that any time there seems to be easy money to be made, the opportunity
    would fade as everyone jumped on it. Let me ask you  why do you think these stocks
    are priced to yield 79? The DVY yields 3.41 as of Aug 30,12. The high yielding
    stocks you discovered may very well be hidden gems. Or they may need to reduce
    their dividends and subsequently drop in price. No, its not safe. If the stocks
    you choose drop by 20, youd lose 40 of your money, if you made the purchase on
    50 margin. Theres risk with any stock purchase, one can claim no stock is safe.
    Either way, your proposal juices the effect to creating twice the risk. Edit  After
    the conversation with Victor, let me add these thoughts. The "RiskFree" rate is
    generally defined to be the 1yr tbill and of course the risk of Gov default is
    not zero. Theres the SP 500 index which has a beta of 1 and is generally viewed
    as a decent index for comparison. You propose to use margin, so your risk, if
    done with an SP index is twice that of the 1X SP investor. However, you wont buy
    SP but stocks with such a high yield I question their safety. You dont mention
    the stocks, so I cant quantify my answer, but its tbill, SP, 2X SP, then you.
- source_sentence: For a car, would you pay cash, finance for 0.9 or lease for 0.9?
  sentences:
  - Given that we live in a world rife with geopolitical risks such as Brexit and
    potential EU breakup, would you say its advisable to keep some of cash savings
    in a foreign currency? Probably not. Primarily because you dont know what will
    happen in the fallout of these sorts of political shifts. You dont know what will
    happen to banking treaties between the various countries involved. If you can
    manage to place funds on deposit in a foreign bankcountry in a currency other
    than your home currency and maintain the deposit insurance in that country and
    not spend too much exchanging your currency then there probably isnt a downside
    other than liquidity loss. If youre thinking Ill just wire some whatever currency
    to some bank in some foreign country in which you have no residency or citizenship
    consideration without considering deposit insurance just so you might protect
    some of your money from a possible future event I think you should stay away.
  - You could write a personal check after the final price has been set and youre
    ready to purchase. Another option would be to get the final price  then walk over
    to your bank and get a cashiers check.
  - This is actually quite a complicated issue. I suggest you talk to a properly licensed
    tax adviser EACPA licensed in your State. Legal advice from an attorney licensed
    in your State is also highly recommended. There are many issues at hand here.
    Income  both types of entities are passthrough, so "earnings" are taxed the same.
    However, for SCorp theres a "reasonable compensation" requirement, so while B
    and C dont do any "work" they may be required to draw salary as executivesdirectors
    if they act as such. Equity  for SCorp you cannot have different classes of shares,
    all are the same. So you cannot have 2 partners contribute money and third to
    contribute nothing work is compensated, youll be getting salary and all three
    have the same stake in the company. You can have that with an LLC. Expansion  SCorp
    is limited to X shareholders, all of which have to be Americans. Once you get
    a foreign partner, or more than 100 partners  you automatically become CCorp whether
    you want it or not. Investors  it would be very hard for you to find external
    investors if youre a LLC. There are many more things to consider. Do not make
    this decision lightly. Fixing things is usually much more expensive than doing
    them right at the first place.
- source_sentence: How much do large sell orders affect stock price?
  sentences:
  - Travellers cheques. Thats exactly what they were intended for. Their usage has
    dropped a lot since everyone can use ATMs in foreign countries, but they still
    exist.
  - I suggest taking a look at your pay stub or pay statement. Your employer should
    provide you with one for each time you get paid. This shows your gross income
    pay period and year to date or YTD for short and all stuff that gets deducted
    and how your actual payment is calculated. In my case there are nine things that
    get taken off Other things that might show up there are various life or accident
    insurances, Child Care flexible spending account, legal  pet insurances, long
    term disability, etc. Some of those are under your control through benefit election
    or contribution choices, others you just have to live with. Still, its worth spending
    the time to look at it occasionally.
  - Essentially, what youre describing is a leveraged investment. As others noted,
    the question is how confident you can be that a the returns on the investment
    will exceed what youre paying in interest, and b that if you lose the bet youll
    still be able to pay off the loan without severely injuring yourself. I did essentially
    this when I bought my house, taking out a larger loan than necessary and leaving
    more money in my investments, which had been returning more than the mortgages
    interest rate. I then got indecently lucky during the recession and was able to
    refinance down to under 4, which I am very certain my investment will beat. I
    actually considered lengthening the term of the loan for that reason, or borrowing
    a bit more, but decided not to double down on the bet that was my own riskcomfort
    threshold. Know exactly what your risks are, including secondary effects of these
    risks. Run the numbers to see what the likely return is. Decide whether you like
    the odds enough to go for it.
- source_sentence: How to determine how much to charge your business for rent in your
    house?
  sentences:
  - DCA is not 10day over 10 days. If I read the objective correctly, Id suggest about
    a 5 year plan. Its difficult to avoid the issue of market timing. And any observation
    Id make about the relative valuation of the market would be opinion. By this I
    mean, some are saying that PE10 which Nobel prize winner Robert Schiller made
    well known, if not popular, shows we are pretty high. Others are suggesting the
    current PE is appropriate given the near zero rate of borrowing. Your income puts
    long term gains at zero under current tax code. Short term are at your marginal
    rate. I would caution not to let the tax tail wag the investing dog. The fellow
    that makes too many buysell decisions based on his taxes is likely to lag he who
    followed his overall allocation goals.
  - The VAT number should be equivalent from the point of view of your client. The
    fact that you are a sole trader and not a limited liability doesnt matter when
    it comes down to pay VAT. They should pay the VAT to you and you will pay it to
    the government. Ill guess that their issue is with tax breaks, it is a bit more
    tricky to receive a tax break on paid taxes if you buy something abroad at least
    it is here in Finland. If they wont pay you because of that, you could open a
    LTD or contract the services of a management company which will do the job of
    invoicing, receiving the money and passing it back to you, for a fee.
  - If you are talking about a home office, you dont "charge" the business anything.
    If the area is used exclusively as an office you prorate by square footage just
    the actual expenses. TurboTax recent published an article "Can I Take the Home
    Office Deduction?" which is a must read if you dont understand the process. Note
    I authored said article.
- source_sentence: Why do credit cards have minimum limits?
  sentences:
  - The first method is the correct one. You bought an asset worth of 1000 and you
    put it on your depreciation schedule. What it means is that you get to write off
    the 1000 over a certain period of time and not at once, as you do with expenses.
    But the value youre writing off is the 1000 regardless of how much youve written
    off already. Assume you depreciate in straight line over 5 years thats how you
    depreciate computers for Federal tax purposes, most states follow. For the simplicity
    of the calculation, assume you depreciate each year as a whole year no midyearmidquarter
    conventions. The calculation is like this If you sell the computer  the proceeds
    above the adjusted basis amount are taxed as depreciation recapture up to the
    accumulated depreciation amount, and as capital gains above that. So in your case  book
    value is the adjusted basis at the end of the year EOY, depreciation this year
    is the amount you depreciate in the year in question out of the total of the original
    cost, and the accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation including the
    current year. In Maryland they do not allow depreciating to 0, but rather down
    to 25 of the original cost, so if you bought a 1000 computer  you depreciate until
    your adjusted basis is 250. Depreciation rates are described here page 5. For
    computers except for large mainframes you get 30 depreciation, with the last year
    probably a bit less due to the 250 adjusted basis limitation.
  - They have a minimum to discourage applications for that particular card. Every
    application costs them money because they have to pay the credit agencies to pull
    the applicants credit history. So one way they save money and reduce their cost
    of business is to discourage people from applying if theyre not creditworthy enough
    for that product. Credit card companies tailor their products into different incomecredit
    brackets. Those who have less creditworthiness would be better suited for a different
    product than what youre referring, similar to those with greater creditworthiness.
  - What was the true reason they wanted to use my accounts for? We wouldnt know the
    true reason. The scammer can do multiple things. What exactly he would do in your
    case ... I am very eager to know what a person was up to who would give to me
    so much information about themselves. I know some of you will jump on the chance
    to yell "it was not their true address", but.... it is where they wanted me to
    send the cards to. And I was to give proof of my identification ie a copy of my
    drivers license, my articles of incorporation and the real estate development
    project prospectus. Also they were only willing to work with certain banks ie
    Citibank, Bank of America etc. I can not understand what they were doing wanting
    such access to accounts that had no money in them save the amount I used to open
    them with. It looks more like they would open accounts under your name, but they
    would be controlling the accounts. i.e. what goes in and out. i.e. they would
    be able to deposit and withdraw from a new account they setup. They would want
    to use this account for illegal activities, so that if caught, the account opening
    paper trail leads to you. Even if they gave you an address, it could be rental.
    Like they have copies of your Company registration and ID proofs, they can use
    these to get another rental property ... and then send letters to some and ask
    them to met there.

Instead of "jane was twice her sons age when he married, and is now 1.5 times his age....." questions in math class, I think the math problems should mostly have dollarpound signs in front of them. In general, I like the idea of relating to the kids situations as much as possible. When my daughter 14 makes a purchase, Id ask her to be aware of how many hours she had to work to make the money she plans to spend. Was it worth 4 hours babysitting to buy an iPad case? Was it worth 2 to buy lunch that we could have made you at home? Note, the convert price to hours worked is a concept that works great when teaching budgeting to anyone, not just kids. The math of tax and discounts for comparison shopping works great as well so long as they understand value. A 400 sweatshirt at 50 off isnt really a bargain, in my opinion.

Warren Buffet follows simple value and GARP tenants that literally anyone could follow if they had the discipline to do so. I have never once heard of an investment made by Warren Buffet that wasnt rooted in fundamentals and easy to understand. The concept is fairly simple as is the math, buying great companies trading at discounts to what they are worth due to market fluctuations, emotionality, or overreactions to key sectors etc. If I buy ABC corp at 10 knowing it is worth 20, it could go down or trade sideways for FIVE YEARS doing seemingly nothing and then one day catch up with its worth due to any number of factors. In that case, my 100 return which took five years to actualize accounts for an average 20 return per year. Also and this should be obvious, but diversification is a double edged sword.
