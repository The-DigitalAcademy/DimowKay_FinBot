- source_sentence: What are the benefits of investing to IRARoth IRA, 401k in comparison
    to investing in long term CDs?
  sentences:
  - BestInvest is a UK site looking at that URL, base on the "co.uk" ending. Yahoo!
    Finance that you use is a USbased site unless you add something else to the URL.
    UK  Ireland Yahoo! Finance is different from where you were as there is something
    to be said for where are you looking. If I was looking for a quarter dollar there
    are Canadian and American coins that meet this so there is something to be said
    for a higher level of categorization being done. "EUN.L" would likely denote the
    "London" exchange as tickers are exchangespecific you do realize, right?
  - My grandma left a 50K inheritance You dont make clear where in the inheritance
    process you are. I actually know of one case where the executor a family member,
    not a professional distributed the inheritance before paying the estate taxes.
    Long story short, the heirs had to pay back part of the inheritance. So the first
    thing that I would do is verify that the estate is closed and all the taxes paid.
    If the executor is a professional, just call and ask. If a family member, you
    may want to approach it more obliquely. Or not. The important thing is not to
    start spending that money until youre sure that you have it. One good thing is
    that my husband is in grad school and will be done in 2019 and will then make
    about 75Kyr with his degree profession. Be a bit careful about relying on this.
    Outside the student loans, you should build other expenses around the assumption
    that he wont find a job immediately after grad school. For example, we could be
    in a recession in 2019. Well be about due by then. Paying off the 5k "other debt"
    is probably a no brainer. Chances are that youre paying doubledigit interest.
    Just kill it. Unless the car loan is zerointerest, you probably want to get rid
    of that loan too. I would tend to agree that the car seems expensive for your
    income, but Im not sure that the amount that you could recover by selling it justifies
    the loss of value. Hopefully its in good shape and will last for years without
    significant maintenance. Consider putting 2k your monthly income in your checking
    account. Instead of paying for things paychecktopaycheck, this should allow you
    to buy things on schedule, without having to wait for the money to appear in your
    account. Put the remainder into an emergency account. Set aside 12k 50 of your
    annual incomeexpenses for real emergencies like a medical emergency or job loss.
    The other 16k you can use the same way you use the 5k other debt borrowing now,
    for small emergencies. E.g. a car repair. Make a budget and stick to it. The elimination
    of the car loan should free up enough monthly income to support a reasonable budget.
    If it seems like it isnt, then you are spending too much money for your income.
    Dont forget to explicitly budget for entertainment and vacations. Its easy to
    overspend there. If you dont make a budget, youll just find yourself back to your
    paychecktopaycheck existence. That sounds like it is frustrating for you. Budget
    so that you know how much money you really need to live.
  - They all basically mean the same thing  a type of debt than can be exchanged for
    converted into equity at some point. Its only the mechanics that can be different.
    A convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond  it usually pays periodic
    interest and has a face value thats due at maturity. The difference is that the
    bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during
    the life of the bond. There can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible,
    and they typically define a quantity of equity number of shares that the bond
    can be converted into. If the market price of the shares goes above a price that
    would make the shares more valuable than the bond, its in the best interest of
    the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a
    kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value thats
    redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round.
    Rather than specifying a specific number of shares, the bond holder receives equity
    at a certain discount to the rest of the market. So they both are debt instruments
    that can turn into equity investments, just through different mechanisms. A debenture
    is a fancy word for unsecured debt, and convertible debt could be used to described
    either structure above, so those terms could mean either type of structure.
- source_sentence: What prevents interest rates from rising?
  sentences:
  - Of course you can accept gold as payment. Would anyone pay in gold? Would it have
    tax consequences on your federal taxes? These additional questions are offtopic
    on this site about personal finance.
  - Interest rates are market driven. They tend to be based on the prime rate set
    by the federal reserve bank because of the tremendous lending capacity of that
    institution and that other loan originators will often fund their own lending
    at least in part with fed loans. However, there is no mandatory link between the
    federal reserve rate and the market rate. No law stipulates that rates cannot
    rise or fall. They will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital.
    Though a lender asking 10 interest might make no loans when others are willing
    to lend for 9. The only protection you have is that we are mostly economically
    free. As a borrower, you are protected by the fact that there are many lenders.
    Likewise, as a lender, because there are many borrowers. Stability is simply by
    virtue of the fact that one market participant with inordinate pricing will find
    fewer counterparties to transact.
  - From The CocaCola Company website, section for Investors Stock History, Issues
    Year 1919 Original issue  600,000 shares 100,000 preferred, par 100 each 500,000
    common, without nominal or par value 1926 Eliminated 100,000 preferred in November.
    This means there were preferred shares issued in 1919. However, all preferred
    shares were "eliminated" not sure what that means as of 1926. There has been no
    subsequent reissuance of preferred shares of CocaCola since then. I think the
    company is still authorized to issue them, should they choose to do so in the
    future.
- source_sentence: Better to rent condo to daughter or put her on title?
  sentences:
  - Credit cards and debit cards make up the bulk of the transactions in the US. Visa
    and Mastercard take a percentage of each credit card transaction. For the most
    part, this fee it built into the price of what you buy. That is, you dont generally
    pay extra at the grocery store if you use a credit card gasoline purchases are
    a notable exception here. If you were getting something like 2 of a third of all
    the retail transactions in the US, youd probably not want to rock the boat too
    much either. Since there is little fraud relative to the amount of money they
    are taking in, and it can often be detected using statistical analysis, they dont
    really stand to gain that much by reducing it through these methods. Sure they
    can reduce the losses on the insurance they provide to the credit card consumer
    but they risk slowing down the money machine. These companies want avoid doing
    something like reducing fraud by 0.5 revenues but causing purchases with the cards
    drop by 1. More security will be implemented as we can see with the slow introduction
    of chip cards in the US but only at a pace that will prevent disruption of the
    money machine. EMV will likely cause a large drop in CC fraud at brickandmortar
    stores but wont stop it online. You will likely see some sort of system like you
    describe rolled out for that eventually.
  - I stumbled on the same discrepancy, and was puzzled by a significant difference
    between the two prices on ETR and FRA. For example, today is Sunday, and google
    shows the following closing prices for DAI. FRADAI ETRDAI So it looks like there
    are indeed two different exchanges trading at different prices. Now, the important
    value here, is the last column Volume. According to Wikipedia, the trading on
    Frankfort Stock Exchange is done today exclusively via Xetra platform, thus the
    volume on ETRDAI is much more important than on FRADAI. Obviously, they Wikipedia
    is not 100 accurate, i.e. not all trading is done electronically via Xetra. According
    to their webpage, Frankfort exchange has a Specialist Trading on Frankfurt Floor
    service which has slightly different trading hours. I suspect what Google and
    Yahoo show as Frankfort exchange is this manual trading via a Specialist opposed
    to Xetra electronic trading. To answer your question, the stock youre having is
    exactly the same, meaning if you bought an ETRBMW you can still sell it on FRA
    by calling a FRA Trading Floor Specialist which will probably cost you a fee.
    On the other hand, for the portfolio valuation and performance assessments you
    should only use ETRBMW prices, because it is way more liquid, and thus better
    reflect the current market valuation.
  - Obviously you have done well financially in order to be able to purchase a condo
    for cash, presumably, without risk of your other obligations. To put things in
    perspective, we are probably talking about less than 5,000 in tax savings. If
    she is on the title then she is a coowner. Are you okay with that? You would essentially
    be giving this child a 50 stake in a property without compensation. Will your
    other children be okay with it? As your question stated you would prefer to not
    have her as an owner. However, is it better to not have her as an owner, So I
    would buy the condo without her on the title and just pay the extra 100 per month
    in property tax. It is probably "small potatoes" in comparison to your net worth.
    I would also only charge her at most your cost of carrying the property as rent.
    While you will create income all of it and probably more could be written off
    as costs. There should be no income tax burden created from this situation. Your
    accountant can help with any paperwork that needs to be filed.
- source_sentence: If earning as freelancer, is it better to be a Sole Trader or Limited
    Company?
  sentences:
  - I answered a similar question before. Essentially, you shouldnt trust a site you
    find on the Internet merely because it looks professional and real. Before signing
    up with any new service provider you found online, you should verify the authenticity
    of both the organization itself and their web site address. Even if the name displayed
    by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm, any site you happen to come
    across on the Internet could be an elaborate spoof of a real company, intended
    to capture your personal details or worse. First, to check if a brokerage firm
    is in fact registered to trade securities  in the United States  you can consult
    FINRAs BrokerCheck online service. This might be the first of many checks you
    should undertake ... after you convince yourself that FINRA is legitimate. A metaproblem  Then,
    if you want to know if the web site address is authentic, one way is to contact
    that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source,
    such as the FINRA BrokerCheck details. Unfortunately, those details do not currently
    appear to contain the brokers web site URL. Else, that could be useful. Another
    thing to look at is the sites login or signup page, for a valid SSL certificate
    that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as
    has been signed by a wellknown certificate authority e.g. VeriSign. For a financial
    services firm of any kind, you should look for and expect to see an Extended Validation
    Certificate. Any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate
    was issued to the domainname owner, and not necessarily to an organization with
    the registered legal name. Yes, anybody can register a domain with a similar name
    and then acquire a basic SSL certificate for that domain. FWIW, Scottrade and
    ShareBuilder are both legitimate brokers I was aware already of each, but I also
    just checked in the FINRA tool, and the URLs currently linked to by the question
    are legitimate web site addresses for each. Also, you can see their EV certificates
    in action on secured pages here and here. As to whether your investments with
    those brokers would be "safe" in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt,
    youll want to know that they are members of the Securities Investor Protection
    Corporation Wikipedia. Of course, this kind of protection doesnt protect you if
    your investments simply go down in value. But do your own due diligence  always.
  - Make sure you shop around and ask a lot of places for a good faith estimate. Last
    I knew, the good faith document is the same everywhere and long form that makes
    it easy enough to compare the hard numbers from place to place. I have gotten
    several estimates for various scenarios and I have had them hand written and printed.
    I discounted the hand written ones because that broker seemed pretty disorganized
    in general Learn the terms online, and start comparing. Use the good faiths as
    a negotiation tool to get lower rates or lower costs from other brokers. See how
    accurate the person is at listening to you and filling out the paperwork. See
    how responsive they are to you when you call with questions and want some changes.
    Check with at least four places. The more places you shop, the better idea you
    will have of what fees are high and what interest rates are low. I might pay a
    higher fee to get a lower interest rate, so there are lots of trade offs to consider.
  - Probably the biggest driver of the increased volumes that day was a change in
    sentiment towards the healthcare sector as a whole that caused many healthcare
    companies to experience higher volumes  httpswww.bloomberg.compressreleases20170711assetacquisitionsaccelerateinhealthcaresectorboostingpotentialrevenuegrowth
    . Following any spike, not just sentiment related spikes, the market tends to
    bounce back to about where it had been previously as analysts at the investment
    banks start to see the stocks as being overbought or oversold. This is because
    the effect of a spike on underlying ratios such as the Sharpe ratio or the PE
    ratio makes the stock look less attractive to buyers and more attractive to sellers,
    including short sellers. Note, however, that the price is broadly still a little
    higher than it was before the spike as a result of this change in sentiment. Looking
    at the price trends on Bloomberg httpswww.bloomberg.comquoteCDNAUS the price had
    been steadily falling for the year prior to the spike but was levelling out at
    just over 1 in the few months immediately prior to the spike. The increased interest
    in the sector and the stock likely added to a general change in the direction
    of the price trend and caused traders as opposed to investors to believe that
    there was a change in the price trend. This will have lead to them trading the
    stock more heavily intraday exacerbating the spike. Note that there traders will
    include HFT bots as well as human traders. You question the legality of this volume
    increase but the simple answer is that we may never know if it was the target
    of traders manipulating the price or a case of insider trading. What we can see
    is that taking "animal spirits" into account without any evidence of illegality
    there are plenty of potential reasons why the spike may have occurred. Spikes
    are common where traders perceive a change in a trend as they rush to cash in
    on the change before other traders can and then sell out quickly when they realise
    that the price is fundamentally out of sync with the firms underlying position.
    You yourself say that you have been watching the stock for some time and, by that
    fact alone, it is likely that others are for the same reasons that you are. Otherwise
    you wouldnt be looking at it. Where people are looking at a stock expecting it
    to take off or drop you expect volatility and volatility means spikes!
- source_sentence: Is accidental death covered in term insurance without a rider?
  sentences:
  - A Section 1256 contract is any Nonequity options include debt options, commodity
    futures options, currency options, and broadbased stock index options. A broadbased
    stock index is based upon the value of a group of diversified stocks or securities
    such as the Standard and Poors 500 index. 60 of the capital gain or loss from
    Section 1256 Contracts is deemed to be longterm capital gain or loss and 40 is
    deemed to be shortterm capital gain or loss. What this means is a more favorable
    tax treatment of 60 of your gains. httpwww.tradelogsoftware.comtaxtopicsfutures
    Its a really wierd rule arbitraty 60 designation, so broad, etc, but section 1256
    contracts get preferential tax treatment and thats what Buffetts talking about.
  - This is assuming that you are now making some amount X per month which is more
    than the income you used to have as a student. Otherwise, the question seems rather
    moot. All figures should be net amounts after taxes. First, figure out what the
    difference in your cost of living is. That is, housing, electricity, utilities,
    the basics that you need to have to have a place in which to live. Im not considering
    food costs here unless they were subsidized while you were studying. Basically,
    you want to figure out how much you now have to spend extra per month for basic
    sustenance. Then, figure out how much more you are now making, compared to when
    you were a student. Subtract the sustenance extra from this to get your net pay
    increase. After that is when it gets trickier. Basically, you want to set aside
    or invest as much of the pay increase as possible, but you probably have other
    expenses now that you didnt before and which you cannot really do that much about.
    This mights be particular types of clothes, commute fares car keepup, gas, bus
    pass, ..., or something entirely different. Anyway, decide on a savings goal,
    as a percentage of your net pay increase compared to when you were a student.
    This might be 5, 10 or if you are really ambitious 50 or more. Whichever number
    you pick, make sure its reasonable giving your living expenses, and keep in mind
    that anything is better than nothing. Find a financial institution that offers
    a highinterest savings account, preferably one with free withdrawals, and sign
    up for one. Each and every time you get paid, figure out how much to save based
    on the percentage you determined if your regular case is that you get the same
    payment each time, you can simply set up an automated bank transfer, put that
    in the savings account and, for the moment, forget about that money. Try your
    best to live only on the remainder, but if you realize that you set aside too
    much, dont be afraid to tap into the savings account. Adjust your future deposits
    accordingly and try to find a good balance. At the end of each month, deposit
    whatever remains in your regular account into your savings account, and if that
    is a sizable amount of money, consider raising your savings goal a little. The
    ultimate goal should be that you dont need to tap into your savings except for
    truly exceptional situations, but still keep enough money outside of the savings
    account to cater to some of your wants. Yes, bank interest rates these days are
    often pretty dismal, and you will probably be lucky to find a savings account
    that especially after taxes will even keep up with inflation. But to start with,
    what you should be focusing on is not to make money in terms of real value appreciation,
    but simply figuring out how much money you really need to sustain a working life
    for yourself and then walking that walk. Eventually this may take anywhere from
    a couple of months to a year or more, you should have settled pretty well on an
    amount that you feel comfortable with setting aside each month and just letting
    be. By that time, you should have a decently sized nest egg already, which will
    help you get over rough spots, and can start thinking about other forms of investing
    some of what you are setting aside. Whenever you get a net pay raise of any kind
    gross pay raise, lower taxes, bonus, whichever, increase your savings goal by
    a portion of that raise. Maybe give yourself 60 of the raise and bank the remaining
    40. That way, you are hopefully! always increasing the amount of money that you
    are setting aside, while also reaping some benefits right away. One major upside
    of this approach is that, if you lose your job, not only will you have that nest
    egg, you will also be used to living on less. So you will have more money in the
    bank and less monthly expenses, which puts you in a significantly better position
    than if you had only one of those, let alone neither.

  | <code>The BenefitsDisadvantages of using a credit card</code>                             | <code>A cautionary tale About 25 years ago I decided that I should try my hand at investing in some technology companies. I was in the computer biz but decided that I might suffer from myopia there, so I researched some medical startups. And I did some reasonably good research, given the available resources the Internet was quite primitive. I narrowed things down to 45 companies, studying their technology plans, then researched their business plans and their personnel. In the end I picked a drug company. Not only did it have a promising business plan, but it had as its CEO a hotshot from some other company, and the BOD was populated buy big names from tech companies and the like. AND the company had like 2 of cash for every 1 of outstanding share value, following their recent IPO. So I sold a bit of stock I had in my employer and bought like 3000 worth of this company. Then, taking the advice Id seen several places, I forgot about it for about 6 months. When I went back to look their stock v...</code> | <code>0.0</code> |
  | <code>Received a call to collect on a 17 year old, charged off debt. What do I do?</code> | <code>There are statutes of limitations on how long they can wait before coming after you. 14 years certainly exceeds it, which I believe means you are not legally required to pay. statutes of limitations by state The most likely scenario is that this is a scam. Second most likely is that this is a collections agency trying to trick you into paying even though they dont have legal authority to force you. In that case if you do pay them anything, then the statute of limitations restarts and they can legally start giving you trouble, so definitely dont do that. If they keep harassing you, you can probably take legal action against them. Thats the worst case scenario, though. Id just ignore them. At this point, if they are legally entitled to any money, which I highly doubt, they will need to take you to court. They are not going to do that over 1000. Blocking their number might be a reasonable idea. I would doubt whether they can even do anything to your credit rating over this issue. If you a...</code> | <code>1.0</code> |
  | <code>Paid cash for a car, but dealer wants to change price</code>                        | <code>I had a similar situation when I was in college. The difference was that the dealer agreed to finance and the bank they used wanted a higher interest rate from me because of my limited credit history. The dealer asked for a rate 5 percentage points higher than what they put on the paperwork. I told them that I would not pay that and I dropped the car off at the lot with a letter rescinding the sale. They werent happy about that and eventually offered me financing at my original rate with a 1000 discount from the previously agreedupon purchase price. What I learned through that experience is that I didnt do a goodenough job of negotiating the original price. I would suggest that your son stop answering phone calls from the dealership for at least 1 week and drive the car as much as possible in that time. If the dealer has cashed the check then that will be the end of it. He owes nothing further. If the dealer has not cashed the check, he should ask whether they prefer to keep the check ...</code> | <code>1.0</code> |
