      "✅ Expected: The company released its 2nd Quarter Revenue of 1,957,921 a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way. Why? If the company is making money shouldnt the stock go up. But that result doesnt indicate that the company is making money. The word for making money is profit, not revenue. Profit equals revenue minus costs. An increasing revenue could mean decreasing profits. For example, marketing expenses could eat up the entirety of the new revenue. This is one of the most basic aspects of researching stocks. If you are having trouble with this, you might find yourself better suited to invest in mutual funds, where they do this research for you. In particular, the safest kind of mutual funds for an inexperienced investor are index funds that track a major index, like the SP 500. Another issue is that stock prices arent based on historical results but on expected future results. Many a company has reported smaller than expected profits and had their price fall even though profits increased from previous results. Looking at it long term would it hurt me in anyway to buy 100,000 shares which right now would run be about 24 including to fee and sit on it? It would cost you 24. You might get a return some day. Or you might waste your money. Given the comparatively large upside, the consensus seems to be that you will probably waste your money. That said, its not a lot of money to waste. So it wont hurt you that much. The most likely result remains that the company will go bankrupt, leaving your stock worthless.\n",

      "🟢 Query: still have mortgage on old house to be torn down want to build new house\n",
      "✅ Expected: I could be wrong, but I doubt youre going to be able to roll the current mortgage into a new one. The problem is that the bank is going to require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house. So the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan AND keep the loantovalue LTV low enough that the bank is secured. So say you currently owe 40k on your mortgage, and you want to build a house that will be worth 200k. In order to avoid PMI, youre going to have to have an LTV of 80 or less, which means that you can spend no more than 160k to build the house. If you want to roll the existing loan in, now you have to build for less than 120k, and theres no way that you can build a 200k house for 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible. Otherwise youre going to have to make up the difference in cash. When you tear down a house, you are essentially throwing away the value of the house  when you have a mortgage on the house, you throw away that value plus you still owe the money, which is a difficult hole to climb out of. A better solution might be to try and sell the house asis, perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash. If that is not a viable option or you dont want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house, provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen, add on a room, remodel bathrooms, etc. So it all depends on what the house is worth today asis, how much it will cost you to rebuild, and what the value of the new house will be.\n",

So the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan AND keep the loantovalue LTV low enough that the bank is secured. So say you currently owe 40k on your mortgage, and you want to build a house that will be worth 200k. In order to avoid PMI, youre going to have to have an LTV of 80 or less, which means that you can spend no more than 160k to build the house. If you want to roll the existing loan in, now you have to build for less than 120k, and theres no way that you can build a 200k house for 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible. Otherwise youre going to have to make up the difference in cash. When you tear down a house, you are essentially throwing away the value of the house  when you have a mortgage on the house, you throw away that value plus you still owe the money, which is a difficult hole to climb out of. A better solution might be to try and sell the house asis, perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash. If that is not a viable option or you dont want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house, provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen, add on a room, remodel bathrooms, etc. So it all depends on what the house is worth today asis, how much it will cost you to rebuild, and what the value of the new house will be.\n",

There are some important differences like a lack of 100 guarantee you get all of your funds back. The SIPC understands you invested knowing there was some risk, and therefore you take that same risk in getting your money from a failed brokerage. However there is still a level of commitment and trust that lessen the risk of investing in the wrong place. Also, do not typo the acronym at your work computer. In the US and perhaps elsewhere it is a racist term, and you are likely to get some bad search results. httpwww.sipc.orghowbrochure.cfm\n",

You put out 10k, you got back 20k, thats a cash gain of 10k, how the asset was valued between your purchase and sale isnt relevant. From an accounting perspective, the company is the only party that is realizing the loss as they have sold the asset for 40K less than par. You the buyer, only get to see the initial buy and sale of such capital asset. Example A company purchases a car for 20,000 and after depreciation it is worth book valued at 2,000. It is then sold to a customer for 3,000. Does the customer realize a loss of 1,000? No. Does the company realize a gain of 1,000? Yes. Your bank analogy is flawed in two ways\n",

The similarities being that they are assets issued by collections of humans corporations, with risk profiles based on the collective decisions of those humans. That doesnt even scratch the surface of the different kinds of asset classes to invest in. Bonds? boring. Bond futures? craziness happening over there  Also, there are potentially very favorable tax treatments for other asset classes. For instance, you mentioned your desire to hold an investment for over a year for tax reasons... well EVERY FUTURES TRADE gets that kind of tax treatment partially, whether you hold it for one day or more, see the 6040 rule. A rebuttal being that some of these asset classes should be left to professionals. Stocks are no different in that regards. Either educate yourself or stick with the managed 401k funds.\n",

      "🟢 Query: Prices go up and salary doesnt where goes delta?\n",
      "✅ Expected: I expected a word or two on the price elasticity of demand here  Andrey, Your question needs slight revision in its current form. Rising prices actually do not mean increased profitability for a company. The quantity they sell also pays a huge part and actually is correlated to the price at which they sell the goods and other factors such as the price at which their competitor sells the goods etc., but we will ignore it for simplicity. The net profit of sales for any firm is equal to Qty x Sale Price  COGS  SGA  taxes  other expenses where, COGS means cost of goods sold SGA means sales, general and admin costs e.g., cleaning the inventory storage area daily so that the goods stay fresh etc. other expenses include any miscellaneous other costs that the firm incurs to make the sale. Now, if everything in that equation remains same COGS, SGA, taxes, and other expenditures, rising prices will only translate into a higher profit if the quantity does not fall by the same margin. Prices may also rise simply as a response to risking COGS, SGA or other expenditures the latter may be observed in inflationary environments. In such a case, the supplying firm can end up losing its profit margin if the quantity falls by more than the price rise.\n",
      "🤖 Predicted: One of the byproducts of free trade is that there is now a global labor market. So companies routinely review their operations and think strategically about where the company is going. Standard options are Because the disincentives that once existed in the past are gone the need for humans to do work, tariffs, regulation, poor infrastructure in the developing world, the available supply of labor is greater and demand lower  thus wages are falling in real terms. Think in the simplest terms in an office environment. In 1980 to make photocopies, you needed a Xerox machine that required a technician on site every couple of weeks to make adjustments, change toner, etc. There was probably a local rep you called to schedule breakfix serivce. Now technology has replaced that copy machine with a cheap multifunction device that requires no maintenance and any technical support is delivered by a person sitting in a Indian call center. So to answer your question, the incremental money from rising prices goes to a number a places. Alot of it goes to oil producers and other commodity producers. Much of it consists of indirect costs that fulfill other mandated services  when you buy something, buried in that cost are things like health insurance, prescription drugs and school taxes.\n",

If youre a sole proprietor  then you could probably open a personal account and just use it, and never tell them that is actually a business. However, depending on your volume of operations, they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions. For corporations, you cannot use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds. Also, youre generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection which is why you have the corporation to begin with. Generally, business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts, and it costs more for the banks to run them. In the US, some banks offer free, or very lowcost, business accounts for small businesses that dont need too many transactions. Im sure if you shop around, youll find those in Canada as well.\n",

      "✅ Expected: I could be wrong, but I doubt youre going to be able to roll the current mortgage into a new one. The problem is that the bank is going to require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house. So the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan AND keep the loantovalue LTV low enough that the bank is secured. So say you currently owe 40k on your mortgage, and you want to build a house that will be worth 200k. In order to avoid PMI, youre going to have to have an LTV of 80 or less, which means that you can spend no more than 160k to build the house. If you want to roll the existing loan in, now you have to build for less than 120k, and theres no way that you can build a 200k house for 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible. Otherwise youre going to have to make up the difference in cash. When you tear down a house, you are essentially throwing away the value of the house  when you have a mortgage on the house, you throw away that value plus you still owe the money, which is a difficult hole to climb out of. A better solution might be to try and sell the house asis, perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash. If that is not a viable option or you dont want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house, provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen, add on a room, remodel bathrooms, etc. So it all depends on what the house is worth today asis, how much it will cost you to rebuild, and what the value of the new house will be.\n",

The net effect of these two taxable events has DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES for DIFFERENT SHAREHOLDERS depending upon their peculiar TAX SITUATIONS. The CORRECT STATEMENT of the tax treatment of unexercised PYLDR rights is in the N2 on page 32, which reads in relevant part as follows , if you receive a Subscription Right from PSEC and do not sell or exercise that right before it expires, you should generally expect to have 1 taxable dividend income equal to the fair market value if any of the Subscription Right on the date of its distribution by PSEC to the extent of PSECs current and accumulated earnings and profits and 2 a capital loss upon the expiration of such right in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis if any in such right which should generally equal the fair market value if any of the Subscription Right on the date of its distribution by PSEC. Please note, for quarterly estimated taxes purposes, that the DIVIDEND taxable events occur ON THE DATE OF ITS DISTRIBUTION BY PSEC my emphasis, while the CAPITAL LOSS occurs UPON EXPIRATION OF SUCH RIGHT my emphasis. They do NOT occur on 31 December 2015 or some other date. However, to my knowledge, neither of the taxable events he mentions would be taxed by 415. If you are worried about it, I would recommend seeing a tax professional. Otherwise Id wait to see the tax forms sent by your brokerage.\n",
