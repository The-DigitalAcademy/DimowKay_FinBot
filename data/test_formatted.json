    "body": "The company released its 2nd Quarter Revenue of 1,957,921 a couple days ago however the stock did not move up in any way. Why? If the company is making money shouldnt the stock go up. But that result doesnt indicate that the company is making money. The word for making money is profit, not revenue. Profit equals revenue minus costs. An increasing revenue could mean decreasing profits. For example, marketing expenses could eat up the entirety of the new revenue. This is one of the most basic aspects of researching stocks. If you are having trouble with this, you might find yourself better suited to invest in mutual funds, where they do this research for you. In particular, the safest kind of mutual funds for an inexperienced investor are index funds that track a major index, like the SP 500. Another issue is that stock prices arent based on historical results but on expected future results. Many a company has reported smaller than expected profits and had their price fall even though profits increased from previous results. Looking at it long term would it hurt me in anyway to buy 100,000 shares which right now would run be about 24 including to fee and sit on it? It would cost you 24. You might get a return some day. Or you might waste your money. Given the comparatively large upside, the consensus seems to be that you will probably waste your money. That said, its not a lot of money to waste. So it wont hurt you that much. The most likely result remains that the company will go bankrupt, leaving your stock worthless."

Im not saying you should or should not buy gold, but the mere fact that it went up a lot recently is not sufficient reason to buy it. Also note that on the house, an investment that accrues continuous interest for 30 years at an annual rate of about 7.7 will multiply by a factor of 10 in 30 years. That rate is pretty high by todays standards, but it might have been more feasible in the past I dont know historical interest rates very well. Yet again note that the fact that houses went up a lot over the last 30 years does not mean they will continue to do so."

    "body": "I could be wrong, but I doubt youre going to be able to roll the current mortgage into a new one. The problem is that the bank is going to require that the new loan is fully collateralized by the new house. So the only way that you can ensure that is if you can construct the house cheaply enough that the difference between the construction cost and the end market value is enough to cover the current loan AND keep the loantovalue LTV low enough that the bank is secured. So say you currently owe 40k on your mortgage, and you want to build a house that will be worth 200k. In order to avoid PMI, youre going to have to have an LTV of 80 or less, which means that you can spend no more than 160k to build the house. If you want to roll the existing loan in, now you have to build for less than 120k, and theres no way that you can build a 200k house for 120k unless you live in an area with very high land value and hire the builders directly and even then it may not be possible. Otherwise youre going to have to make up the difference in cash. When you tear down a house, you are essentially throwing away the value of the house  when you have a mortgage on the house, you throw away that value plus you still owe the money, which is a difficult hole to climb out of. A better solution might be to try and sell the house asis, perhaps to someone else who can tear down the house and rebuild with cash. If that is not a viable option or you dont want to move then you might consider a home equity loan to renovate parts of the house, provided that they increase the market value enough to justify the cost e.g. modernize the kitchen, add on a room, remodel bathrooms, etc. So it all depends on what the house is worth today asis, how much it will cost you to rebuild, and what the value of the new house will be."

I found this link via google, which states that Not only does the PSEC shareholder have a TAXABLE EVENT, but he has TWO taxable events. The net effect of these two taxable events has DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES for DIFFERENT SHAREHOLDERS depending upon their peculiar TAX SITUATIONS. The CORRECT STATEMENT of the tax treatment of unexercised PYLDR rights is in the N2 on page 32, which reads in relevant part as follows , if you receive a Subscription Right from PSEC and do not sell or exercise that right before it expires, you should generally expect to have 1 taxable dividend income equal to the fair market value if any of the Subscription Right on the date of its distribution by PSEC to the extent of PSECs current and accumulated earnings and profits and 2 a capital loss upon the expiration of such right in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis if any in such right which should generally equal the fair market value if any of the Subscription Right on the date of its distribution by PSEC. Please note, for quarterly estimated taxes purposes, that the DIVIDEND taxable events occur ON THE DATE OF ITS DISTRIBUTION BY PSEC my emphasis, while the CAPITAL LOSS occurs UPON EXPIRATION OF SUCH RIGHT my emphasis. They do NOT occur on 31 December 2015 or some other date. However, to my knowledge, neither of the taxable events he mentions would be taxed by 415. If you are worried about it, I would recommend seeing a tax professional. Otherwise Id wait to see the tax forms sent by your brokerage."

If its just a bedroom suite, rather than a full legal apartment, I dont think you can claim it as rental. Note that whether you decide to share cooking and such is a separate question apartment in most areas requires its own kitchen and bathroom. As Joe pointed out, the actual purchase also sounds like its going to involve a large gift, which has its own tax implications. Either that, or they retain ownership of their share and you get to deal with that if you or they decide to sell. Again GET A LAWYER.

Generally, the United States is a union of 50 different sovereign entities, so youre asking more about Texas, less about the US. So youd better talk to a Texas lawyer. Usually, stock ownership is only registered by the company itself and sometimes not even that, look up \"street name\", and not reported to the government. You may get a paper stock certificate, but many companies no longer issue those. Dont forget to talk to a lawyer and a tax adviser in your home country, as well. Youll be dealing with tax authorities there as well. The difference between \"unoted\" never heard of this term before and \"regular\" stocks is that the \"unoted\" are not publicly traded. As such, many things that your broker does like tax statements, at source withholding, etc you and your company will have to do on your own.

However, not insuring your car has a hidden cost you cant longterm invest that money anymore.

    "body": "Adding international bonds to an individual investors portfolio is a controversial subject. On top of the standard risks of bonds you are adding country specific risk, currency risk and diversifying your individual company risk. In theory many of these risks should be rewarded but the data are noisy at best and adding risk like developed currency risk may not be rewarded at all. Also, most of the risk and diversification mentioned above are already added by international stocks. Depending on your home country adding international or emerging market stock etfs only add a few extra bps of fees while international bond etfs can add 30100bps of fees over their domestic versions. This is a fairly high bar for adding this type of diversification. US bonds for foreign investors are a possible exception to the high fees though the governments bonds yield little. If your home currency or currency union does not have a deep bond market andor bonds make up most of your portfolio it is probably worth diversifying a chunk of your bond exposure internationally. Otherwise, you can get most of the diversification much more cheaply by just using international stocks."

Just guessing, but Ill bet most of the reason is historical Before uptothemoment quotes were readily available, that was a bit tedious to calculateupdate the funds value, so enactedlaws let it be done just once per day. NL7 quotes the security act of 1940, which certainly has been updated, but also still might contain the results of crufty rationales, like this. There are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks, though One share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock There is a finite supply of CompanyXstock, and people are trading that piece of ownership around, and barter to find an mutuallyagreeableprice. But when you buy into a mutualfund, the mutualfund \"suddenly has more shares\"  it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks in a ratio equal to its current holdings. As a consequence the mutual funds price isnt determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price like stock there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund, and thats the weighted total of its underlying stock. If you wanted to sell your ownershipofMutualFundZ to a friend at 234pm, there wouldnt be any bartering, youd just calculate the value based on the statedvalue of the underlying stock at that exact moment. So theres no inherent reason you cant instantaneously price a mutual fund. BUT people dont really buysell funds to each other  they go to the fundmanager and essentially make a depositorwithdraw. The fundmanager is only required by law to do it once a day and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often?, so thats all they do. [Disclaimer I know very little about markets and finance.

I then got indecently lucky during the recession and was able to refinance down to under 4, which I am very certain my investment will beat. I actually considered lengthening the term of the loan for that reason, or borrowing a bit more, but decided not to double down on the bet that was my own riskcomfort threshold.

Followup question what prevents the broker lending the shares for a very short time less than a day, pocketing the interest and returning the lenders their shares without much change in share price because borrowing period was very short. What prevents them from doing that many times a day ? Lack of market. Short selling for short periods of time isnt so common as to allow for \"many\" times a day. Some day traders may do it occasionally, but I dont know that it would be a reliable business model to supply them. If there are enough people interested in shorting the stock, they will probably want to hold onto it long enough for the anticipated movement to happen. There are transaction costs here. Both fees for trading at all and the extra charges for short sale borrowing and interest. Most stocks do not move down by large enough amounts \"many\" times a day. Their fluctuations are smaller. If the stock doesnt move enough to cover the transaction fees, then that seller lost money overall. Over time, sellers like that will stop trading, as they will lose all their money. All that said, there are no legal blocks to loaning the stock out many times, just practical ones. If a stock was varying wildly for some bizarre reason, it could happen."

    "body": "You are conflating two different types of risk here. First, you want to invest money, and presumably youre not looking at the \"lowest risk, lowest returns\" end of the spectrum. This is an inherently risky activity. Second, you are in a principalagent relationship with your advisor, and are exposed to the risk of your advisor not maximizing your profits. A lot has been written on principalagent theory, and while incentive schemes exist, there is no optimal solution. In your case, you hope that your agent will start maximizing your profits if they are 100 correlated with his profits. While this idea is true at least according to standard economic theory, you could find exceptions in behavioral economics and in reality, it also forces the agent to participate in the first risk. From the point of view of the agent, this does not make sense. He is looking to render services and receive income for it. An agent with integrity is certainly prepared to carry the risk of his own incompetence, just like Apple is prepared to replace your iPhone should it not start one day. But the agent is not prepared to carry additional risks such as the market risk, and should not be compelled to do so. It is your risk, a risk you personally take by deciding to play the investment gamble, and you cannot transfer it to somebody else. Of course, what makes the situation here more difficult than the iPhone example is that marketdriven losses cannot be easily distinguished from incompetentagent losses. So, there is no setup in which you carry the market risk only and your agent carries the incompetence risk only. But as much as you want a solution in which the agent carries all risk, you probably wont find an agent willing to sign such a contract. So you have to simply accept that both the market risk and the incompetence risk are inherent to being an investor. You can try to mitigate your own incompetence by having an advisor invest for you, but then you have to accept the risk of his incompetence. There is no way to depress the total incompetence risk to zero."

Many times it only makes sense to carry items that enhance the value of something else the store sells. Stores pay big money to study consumer behaviors and preferences in order to understand what items are natural fits for each other and the best ways to market them. A good example of what youre talking about is the fact that many grocery stores carry private label products that sell for higher margins, and theyll stock them alongside the name brands that cost much more. As a consequence and since consumers often dont see a qualitative difference between store brands and name brands much of the time to rationalize spending more, the stores own brands sell better.

    "body": "I seem not to be able to comment on the first answer due to reputation, so Ill aim to enhanced the first answer which is generally good but with these caveats 1 Dividends are not \"guaranteed\" to preferred shareholders. Rather, preferred shareholders are normally in line ahead i.e. in preference to or \"preferred\" of common shareholders in terms of dividend payment. This is an extremely important distinction, because unlike investments that we generally consider \"guaranteed\" such as CDs known as GICs in Canada, a companys board can suspend the dividend at anytime for long periods of time without significant repercussions  whereas a missed payment to a bank or secured bondholder can often push a company into bankruptcy very quickly. 2 Due to point 1, it is extremely important to know the \"convenants\" or rules sorrounding both the preferred shares you are buying and the other more senior creditors of that issuing company i.e. taxes almost always come first, banks loans, leases, bonds etc.. It is also important to know if a particular preferred share has \"cumulative\" dividends. You generally only want to buy preferreds that have \"cumulative\" dividends, since that means that anytime the company misses a payment, they must pay those dividends first before any other dividends at the same or lower priority in the future. 3 Unlike a common stock, your upside on a preferred stock is relatively fixed you get a fixed share of the companys profit and thats it, whereas a common shareholder gets everything thats left over after interest and preferred dividends are paid. So if the company does really well you will theoretically do much better with common stock over time. For the above reasons, it is generally advisable to think of preferred shares as being more similar to really risky bonds in the same company, rather than similar to common stock. Of course, if you are an advanced investor there are a lot more variables in play such as tax considerations and whether the preferred have special options attached to them such conversion into common shares."

    "body": "The margin money you put up to fund a short position 6000 in the example given is simply a \"good faith\" deposit that is required by the broker in order to show that you are acting in good faith and fully intend to meet any potential losses that may occur. This margin is normally called initial margin. It is not an accounting item, meaning it is not debited from you cash account. Rather, the broker simply segregates these funds so that you may not use them to fund other trading. When you settle your position these funds are released from segregation. In addition, there is a second type of margin, called variation margin, which must be maintained while holding a short position. The variation margin is simply the running profit or loss being incurred on the short position. In you example, if you sold 200 shares at 20 and the price went to 21, then your variation margin would be a debit of 200, while if the price went to 19, the variation margin would be a credit of 200. The variation margin will be netted with the initial margin to give the total margin requirement 6000 in this example. Margin requirements are computed at the close of business on each trading day. If you are showing a loss of 200 on the variation margin, then you will be required to put up an additional 200 of margin money in order to maintain the 6000 margin requirement  6000  200  5800, so you must add 200 to maintain 6000. If you are showing a profit of 200, then 200 will be released from segregation  6000  200  6200, so 200 will be release from segregation leaving 6000 as required. When you settle your short position by buying back the shares, the margin monies will be release from segregation and the ledger postings to you cash account will be made according to whether you have made a profit or a loss. So if you made a loss of 200 on the trade, then your account will be debited for 200 plus any applicable commissions. If you made a profit of 200 on the trade then your account will be credited with 200 and debited with any applicable commissions."

    "header": "Short term investing vs Leaving money alone?",
    "body": "Should I invest the money I dont need immediately and only withdraw it next year when I need it for living expenses or should I simply leave it in my current account? This might come as a bit of a surprise, but your money is already invested. We talk of investment vehicles. An investment vehicle is basically a place where you can put money and have it either earn a return, or be able to get it back later, or both. The neither case is generally called \"spending\". There are also investment classes which are things like cash, stocks, bonds, precious metals, etc. different things that you can buy within an investment vehicle. You currently have the money in a bank account. Bank accounts currently earn very low interest rates, but they are also very liquid and very secure in the sense of being certain that you will get the principal back. Now, when you talk about \"investing the money\", you are probably thinking of moving it from where it is currently sitting earning next to no return, to somewhere it can earn a somewhat higher return. And thats fine, but you should keep in mind that you arent really investing it in that case, only moving it. The key to deciding about an asset allocation how much of your money to put into what investment classes is your investment horizon. The investment horizon is simply for how long you plan on letting the money remain where you put it. For money that you do not expect to touch for more than five years, common advice is to put it in the stock market. This is simply because in the long term, historically, the stock market has outperformed most other investment classes when looking at return versus risk volatility. However, money that you expect to need sooner than that is often recommended against putting it in the stock market. The reason for this is that the stock market is volatile  the value of your investment can fluctuate, and theres always the risk that it will be down when you need the money. If you dont need the money within several years, you can ride that out but if you need the money within the next year, you might not have time to ride out the dip in the stock market! So, for money that you are going to need soon, you should be looking for less volatile investment classes. Bonds are generally less volatile than stocks, with government bonds generally being less volatile than corporate bonds. Bank accounts are even less volatile, coming in at practically zero volatility, but also have much lower expected rates of return. For the money that you need within a year, I would recommend against any volatile investment class. In other words, you might take whichever part you dont need within a year and put in bonds except for what you dont foresee needing within the next half decade or more, which you can put in stocks, then put the remainder in a simple highyield depositinsured savings account. It wont earn much, but you will be basically guaranteed that the money will still be there when you want it in a year. For the money you put into bonds and stocks, find lowcost index mutual funds or exchangetraded funds to do so. You cannot predict the future rate of return of any investment, but you can predict the cost of the investment with a high degree of accuracy. Hence, for any given investment class, strive to minimize cost, as doing so is likely to lead to better return on investment over time. Its extremely rare to find highercost alternatives that are actually worth it in the long term."

Even the crappiest, minimally compliant hovel is ultimately worth whatever the government will issue housing vouchers for. Rent can and does fluctuate for the higher end of the market. Basically in most places the available, cheap credit has a negative impact on rent prices, and tighter, costlier credit increases demand and rents. Local economic events have an impact too.

    "body": "Theres several different tradeoffs wrapped up in your question. In general, refinancing a mortgage to a lower interest rate makes sense if you are certain youll be living in the house for N years. N depends on your closing costs and points. Basically you need to calculate the breakeven point for when the savings from the reduced interest rate exceeds the cost of the refi. When I refinanced, the broker did the calculations for me for a range of options, maybe yours could as well. The trade off in selecting 30year vs. 15year is between monthly payment and total outlay. A 15year mortgage will have a higher monthly payment, but the total money that is paid out the bank rather than to your equity will be less. Using the Heloc to do the down payment seems sketchy plus then you have two loan payments youre making each month. Why not keep it simple and look for a 250k loan with 5 down? Presumably with the current mortgage you already put in a good down payment, and have built some equity up."

You will be mailed a form to fill out and mail back in. Preferred shares usually are not voting shares,but common shares always are. By the way, I do not recommend owning shares in companies. I recommend funds instead,either ETFs or mutual funds. Owning shares in companies puts you at risk of a failure of that company. Owning funds spreads that risk around,thus reducing your exposure. There are, really, two purposes for owning shares 1 Owning shares gives you the right to declared dividends 2 Owning shares allows you to sell those shares at some time in the future. Hopefully at a profit One obscure thing you can do with owned shares is to write sell covered put options. But options are not something that you need to concern yourself with at this point.

First, take all of your short term gains then offset them by all of your short term losses. Do the same for long term gains and losses. Short and long term gains are taxed at different rates. You can deduct losses from short term to your long term and vice versa. Then you can deduct the total losses up to 3000 household, 1500 married, filing separately per year on your regular income taxes or other dividend taxes.

However, dealers are usually pretty smart on only ordering the cars they know they can sell before this happens. Also, manufacturers are usually pretty good about only producing enough vehicles to cover demand. Honestly, you arent likely to see these incentives materialize unless the manufacturer really screwed up. If that happens then three things occur. First is that manufacturers give a hidden incentive to the dealers. Dealers wont publicize this, even internally. If the cars are still not moving after a month, then the dealers will tell the salespeople that those cars have a specific \"bonus\" on them. If those cars still dont sell, then the bonus inflates quite a bit and dealers begin advertising that car at a deep discount on the radio. Its pretty much guaranteed to sell at that point. Barring those circumstances, the deal you get on a brand new car, late in the model year, is likely to be the same you could have gotten early in the model year. Honestly, if you want the best deal possible, look at the date of the inspection sticker on the car. If it is close to the 3 month mark then the dealer will bend over backwards to sell the car as the finance costs are racking up on it. Theyll often sell that one at heavy discounts."

    "header": "Why is it rational to pay out a dividend?",
    "body": "First, you need to understand that not every investors goals are the same. Some investors are investing for income. They want to invest in a profitable company and use the profit from the company as income. If that investor invests only in stocks that do not pay a dividend, the only way he can realize income is to sell his investment. But he can invest in companies that pay a regular dividend and use that income while keeping his investment intact. Imagine this Lets say I own a profitable company, and I offer to sell you part ownership in that company. However, I tell you this upfront no matter how much profit our company makes, you will never get a penny from me. You will be getting a stock certificate  a piece of paper  and thats it. You can watch the company grow, and you can tell yourself you own it, but the only way you will personally benefit from your investment would be to sell your piece to someone else, who would also never see a penny in profit. Does that sound like a good investment? The fact of the matter is, stocks in companies that do not distribute dividends do have value, but this value is largely based on the potential of profitsdividends at some point in the future. If a company vows never ever to pay dividends, why would anyone invest? An investment would be more of a donation like Kickstarter at that point. A company that pays dividends is possibly past their growth stage. That doesnt necessarily mean that they have stopped growing altogether, but remember that an expansion project for any company does not automatically yield a good result. If a company does not have a good opportunity currently for a growth project, I as an investor would rather get a dividend than have the company blow all the profit on a illfated gamble."

The data in the visual representation comes from the top of the order book the best bids, and the best asks, but that visual representation is choosing to present it in a specific way. Think of the \"book\" as the model, the abstract collection of outstanding bid and ask order data. When people talk about the \"top of the book\", theyre talking about the best bids higher being better, and the best asks lower being better. The visual representation above is but one possible way to render a tipoftheiceberg view of the best orders in the \"book\". The advantage of that particular visual representation is that one can see the asks  bids converging towards the center. The spread is visible as the difference between the two middle elements  being the lowest row in the blue \"Asks\" area, and the highest row in the green \"Bids\" area. The uparrow they had included in the \"Asks\" area was perhaps meant to provide a clue about how the data was sorted contrary to expectations of descending order of \"bestness\", andor to imply there is further depth to the book data in the indicated direction.

Third, if someone buys up enough shares of the company then they gain control of the company which while you arent mentioning this case, it is something to note as some individuals buy stock so that they can take over the company which happens.

Disadvantages are that you cannot use this money for investing, you cannot use this money for tax deductions and that in a state of inflation, not paying it off in advance could save you a lot of money.

    "body": "Because people are Risk Averse. Suppose that you own an asset worth 10,000 to you. Suppose that each year, the asset has 1 chance of being stolen or completely broken. The expected value is 99 x 10,000  1 x 0  9,900. This is the average outcome if you do not buy insurance. Now consider two mutually exclusive outcomes 99 chance of keeping 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value 9,900 100 chance of keeping 9,900 expected value 9,900 Everyone would choose option 2, even though the expected values are the same. Option 2 is an insurance that cost 100 Actuarially fair, aka the odds are fair. Now suppose the insurance costs 150 instead of 100 despite that the bad probability is still 1. You are faced with 99 chance of keeping 10,000 and 1 chance of losing everything expected value 9,900 100 chance of keeping 9,850 expected value 9,850 Some people would still choose option 2, even though the expected value is actually lower. The 50 is called Risk Premium, which people are willing to pay in order to avoid uncertainty. The odds are unfair, but the Risk Premium has its value. That being said, competition between insurance companies would drive down the premium until the insurance is close to actuarially fair, but they have cost to cover sales, administration, etc, making the odds \"unfair\"."

    "body": "Thanks for your service. I would avoid personal investment opportunities at this point. Reason being that you cant personally oversee them if you are deployed overseas. This would rule out rentals and small businesses. Revisit those possibilities if you get married or leave the service. If you have a definite time when you would like to purchase a car, you could buy a six or twelve month CD with the funds that you need for that. That will slightly bump up your returns without taking much risk. If you dont really need to buy the car, you could invest that money in stocks. Then if the stock market tanks, you wait until it recovers note that that can be five to ten years or until you build up your savings again. That increases your reward at a significant increase in your risk. The risk being that you might not be able to buy a car for several more years. Build an emergency fund. I would recommend six months of income. Reason being that your current circumstances are likely to change in an emergency. If you leave the service, your expenses increase a lot. If nothing else, the army stops providing room for you. That takes your expenses from trivial to a third of your income. So basing your emergency fund on expenses is likely to leave you short of what you need if your emergency leaves you out of the service. Army pay seems like a lot because room and board when deployed are provided. Without that, its actually not that much. Its your low expenses that make you feel flush, not your income. If you made the same pay in civilian life, youd likely feel rather poor. 30,000 sounds like a lot of money, but it really isnt. The median household income is a little over 50,000, so the median emergency fund should be something like 25,000 on the income standard. On the expenses standard, the emergency fund should be at least 15,000. The 15,000 remainder would buy a cheap new car or a good used car. The 5000 remainder from the income standard would give you a decent used car. I wouldnt recommend taking out a loan because you dont want to get stuck paying a loan on a car you cant drive because you deployed. Note that if you are out of contact, in the hospital, or captured, you may not be able to respond if there is a problem with the car or the loan. If you pay cash, you can leave the car with family and let them take care of things in case of a deployment. If you invested in a Roth IRA in January of 2016, you could have invested in either 2015 or 2016. If 2015, you can invest again for 2016. If not, you can invest for 2017 in three months. You may already know all that, but it seemed worth making explicit. The Thrift Savings Plan TSP allows you to invest up to 18,000 a year. If youre investing less than that, you could simply boost it to the limit. You apparently have an extra 10,000 that you could contribute. A 60 or 70 contribution is quite possible while in the army. If you max out your retirement savings now, it will give you more options when you leave the service. Or even if you just move out of base housing. If your TSP is maxed out, I would suggest automatically investing a portion of your income in a regular taxable mutual fund account. Most other investment opportunities require help to make work automatically. You essentially have to turn the money over to some individual you trust. Securities can be automated so that your investment grows automatically even when you are out of touch."

If youre carrying extremely high interest debt such as payday loans or similar, its almost always going to be worth paying down that debt as quickly as possible, even if it means forgoing matching 401k payments. The other possible reason for not taking the matching funds are if the required contributions would put you in a significant bind  if youre barely scraping by, and you cant squeeze enough savings out of your budget that youd risk default on a loan eg, car or house or might take penalties for late fees on your utilities, it might be preferable to save up for a bit before starting the contributions  especially if youve maxed your available credit so you cant just push stuff to credit cards as a last resort."

If the business itself is only worth 400 million, then you would have 4.4bn market caps and 400 million enterprise value. The \"enterprise value\" is basically how much the business would be worth if it had no cash or no debt. These numbers would be a very unusual situation. It could happen for example if a big company has sold 90 of its business for cash. When you buy a share of the company, you get a tiny share of the business and you own a tiny share of the cash. This stock will very likely keep its value, but wont make much money. On the other hand, more common would be a company where the business is worth 4bn, but the company has also 4bn debt. So it is worth exactly zero. Market caps close to zero, but enterprise value 4bn, because you ignore the debt in the enterprise value. Edit Sorry, got the \"enterprise value\" totally wrong, read millions instead of billions Your numbers would mean that you have a huge, huge company with close to 440bn debt. Most likely someone made a mistake here.

    "body": "A share of stock is a share of the underlying business. If one believes the underlying business will grow in value, then one would expect the stock price to increase commensurately. Participants in the stock market, in theory, assign value based on some combination of factors like capital assets, cash on hand, revenue, cash flow, profits, dividends paid, and a bunch of other things, including \"intangibles\" like customer loyalty. A dividend stream may be more important to one investor than another. But, essentially, nondividend paying companies and, thus, their shares are expected by their owners to become more valuable over time, at which point they may be sold for a profit. EDIT TO ADD Lets take an extremely simple example of company valuation book value, or the sum of assets capital, cash, etc and liabilities debt, etc. Suppose our company has a book value of 1M today, and has 1 million shares outstanding, and so each share is priced at 1. Now, suppose the company, over the next year, puts another 1M in the bank through its profitable operation. Now, the book value is 2share. Suppose further that the stock price did not go up, so the market capitalization is still 1M, but the underlying asset is worth 2M. Some extremely rational market participant should then immediately use his 1M to buy up all the shares of the company for 1M and sell the underlying assets for their 2M value, for an instant profit of 100. But this rarely happens, because the existing shareholders are also rational, can read the balance sheet, and refuse to sell their shares unless they get something a lot closer to 2likely even more if they expect the company to keep getting bigger. In reality, the valuation of shares is obviously much more complicated, but this is the essence of it. This is how one makes money from growth as opposed to income stocks. You are correct that you get no income stream while you hold the asset. But you do get money from selling, eventually."

A significant percentage of the TARP loans have been or will be paid back. So, the final price tag of the TARP was only a few billion pretty low considering the scale of the program. There is 10 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding. Thats a much higher price tag than TARP. Secondly, paying off the mortgages  no repayment to the government as there was with TARP. The initial price tag of your plan would be 10 trillion, instead of a few billion. Furthermore how does a government with 15 trillion in debt already come up with an extra 10 trillion to pay off peoples mortgages? Should the government go deeper into debt? Print more money and trigger inflation? Note Some people like to talk about a \"secret bailout\" by the Fed, implying that the true cost of TARP was much higher than claimed by the government. The \"secret bailout\" was a series of shortterm lowno interest loans to banks. Because they were loans, which were paid back, my point still stands. Some other issues to consider Remember that the principal balance of your mortgage is only a small portion of your payments to the bank. Over 30 years, you pay a lot of  in interest to the bank thats how banks make a profit. Banks are expecting that revenue, and it is factored into their financial projections. If those revenue streams suddenly disappeared, I expect it would majorly screw the up the financial industry. Many people bought houses during the real estate boom, when housing prices were inflated far beyond the \"real\" value of the house. Is it right to overpay for these houses? This rewards the banks for accepting the inflated value during the appraisal process. Loan modification forces banks to accept the \"real\" value of the house. The financial crisis was triggered by people buying houses they could not afford. Should they be rewarded with a free house for making poor financial decisions?"

You do not borrow against it nor do you withdraw from it in emergencies or to buy a house. 2 Catestrophic savings This is money you put back in case of serious events. Events like prolonged job loss, hospitalization, extended illness, loss of home, severe and significant loss of transportation, very large aplliance loss or damage. You do not take trips to the Bahamas or buy diamond rings with this money. 3 Urgent, relatively small, need savings. This is the savings you can use from time to time. Use it for bills that arise unexpectedly, unforseen shortfalls in your budget, needed repairs such as car repairs and small appliance repairs, surprising fines, fees, and bills. Put 10 of your income into each category of savings. 10 intro retirement savings, another, separate, 10 intro Catestrophic savings, and yet another 10 intro urgent, small need, savings. So, as you can see, already 30 of your income is already spoken for. Divide up the remaining 70 intro fixed I recommend 50 toward fixed expenses and variable expenses. Fixed includes those things that you pay once every month such as housing, utilities, car payment, debt repayment, etc. Variable includes discretionary things like eating out, gifts, and splurges. Most importantly, partner with someone who is your opposite. If you are a saver at heart partner with a spender. If you are a spender partner with a saver. There are three rules to live by regarding the budget A no one spends any money unless it is in the budget B the budget only includes those things to which both the saver and the spender agree C the budget can, and will, be modified as the pay period unfolds. A budget is a plan not a means to beat the other person up. Plans change as new information arises. A budget must be flexible. The urgent use savings will help to make the budget flexible. Edit due to comments enderland Perhaps you do not have children living with you. I am a saver, my wife is a spender. When it came time to do the budget I would forget things like the birthdays of my children, school fees due next pay period, shopping for Christmas gifts, needed new clothes and shoes for the children, broken small appliances that needed to be fixed or replaced, special non reoccurring house maintenence like steam cleaning the carpet, gifts to relatives and friends, exceptional assistance to relatives, etc. As my wife was the spender she would remind me of these things. Perhaps you do not have these events in your life. I am glad to have these events in my life as that means that I have people in my life that I care about.

I would suspect that a school district etc can use a 401k plan instead of a 403b plan if it chooses to do so, but the reverse direction is most likely forbidden a forprofit company cannot use a 403b plan. One difference between a 403b plan and a 401k plan is that the employer can choose to offer, and the employee can choose to purchase, stock in the company inside the 401k plan. This option obviously is not available to charities etc. which dont issue stock. Your comment that the 403b plan invests solely in variable annuities suggests that the plan administrator is an insurance company and that the employer is moving to more \"modern\" version that allows investments in mutual funds and the like. Forty years ago, my 403b plan was like that the only investment choice was an annuity, but some time in the 1980s, the investment choices were broadened to include mutual funds possibly because the 1986 Tax Reform Act changed the rules governing 403b plans. So, are you sure that your employer is changing from a 403b plan to a 401k plan, or is it just a change of 403b plan administrator from the insurance company to another administrator who offers investment choices other than an annuity? Note, of course, that insurance companies have changed their options too. For example, TIAA the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association which was the 403b plan administrator for many schools and colleges became TIAACREF College Retirement Equities Fund where the CREF mutual funds actually were pretty good investments."

Thats probably the main reason why they receive such massive discounts see thelems post. Obviously, the Mercedes Benz AMG Edition rental car will have a lasting impression on the driver and the people not renting it, but seeing the boastful ads of the car rental company. So both the car industry and the rental company want this lasting impression to be a perfect one. A holiday car rental agency may have much lower standards. They often dont have recurring customers. They dont rent premium cars to premium customers but cheap cars to cheap customers.They dont receive the discounts the premium agencies receive. And they will milk their car to the max. You will notice that they windows fall out of the car when you bang the door shut. You will find that opening the door will be more difficult than breaking into the car. The seats may be stained  at least in the spots where some of the upholsters is still present. On the plus side, if you are lucky, the heating still works. On the minus side, you might not be able to turn it off. Water might leak into the car when its raining, but thats not much of a problem as it will drain out through the holes in the bottom. No fear that water might rush in through these holes when driving though a puddle  the engine will not start during humid weather, so thats a nonissue. In any case, car rental customer might have mistreated the car. The engine has most probably not been run in. However, this appears to be less than an issue with modern car than it has been in the past. And very very few rental car drivers think that they really have to absolutely emulate Michael Schumacher just because they drive a car which is not their own.

    "body": "MrChrister makes some good points, but I saw his invitation to offer a counter opinion. First, there is a normal annual deposit limit of 13,000 per parent or donee. This is the gift limit, due to rise to 14,000 in 2013. If your goal is strictly to fund college, and this limit isnt an issue for you, the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time. In that case, youre going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly. But, as you mention, theres gift money that your considering depositing to the account. In this case, theres really a legal issue. The normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary, and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a UTMA account. There is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary, a UTMA 529. Clearly, in that case, you need separate accounts. In conclusion, I think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves. If the true gift money from others is minimal, maybe you should just keep it in a regular account. Edit  on further reflection, I strongly suggest you keep the relatives gifts in a separate account, and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income, use this money to open and deposit to Roth IRAs. They can deposit the lesser of their earned income or 5000 in 2012, 5500 in 2013. This serves two goals  avoiding the risk of gift money being stolen from one child for benefit of the other, and putting it into an account that can help your children long term, but not impact college aid as would a simple savings or brokerage account."

    "body": "The first method is the correct one. You bought an asset worth of 1000 and you put it on your depreciation schedule. What it means is that you get to write off the 1000 over a certain period of time and not at once, as you do with expenses. But the value youre writing off is the 1000 regardless of how much youve written off already. Assume you depreciate in straight line over 5 years thats how you depreciate computers for Federal tax purposes, most states follow. For the simplicity of the calculation, assume you depreciate each year as a whole year no midyearmidquarter conventions. The calculation is like this If you sell the computer  the proceeds above the adjusted basis amount are taxed as depreciation recapture up to the accumulated depreciation amount, and as capital gains above that. So in your case  book value is the adjusted basis at the end of the year EOY, depreciation this year is the amount you depreciate in the year in question out of the total of the original cost, and the accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation including the current year. In Maryland they do not allow depreciating to 0, but rather down to 25 of the original cost, so if you bought a 1000 computer  you depreciate until your adjusted basis is 250. Depreciation rates are described here page 5. For computers except for large mainframes you get 30 depreciation, with the last year probably a bit less due to the 250 adjusted basis limitation."

If you looked at the balance sheet after the sale, youd see the number of shares in a note to the side. When shares trade publicly, the corporation usually has very little to do with it unless if they are selling or buying new shares under whatever label such as IPO, secondary offering, share repurchase, etc, but the corporations volume from such activity would still be far below the activity of the third parties shares are trading almost exclusively between third parties. These share sales and purchases will only be seen on the income statement under earnings per share EPS, as EPS will rise and fall with stock repurchases and sales assuming income is held constant. While not technically part of the income statement but printed with it, the \"basic weighted average\" and \"diluted weighted average\" number of shares are also printed which are the weighted average over the reporting period of shares actually issued and expected if all promises to issue shares with employee stock options, grants, convertibles were made kept. The income statement is the accrual accounts of the operations of the company. It has little detail on investing depreciation  appreciation or financing interest expenses  preferred dividends."

    "header": "What bonds do I keep and which do I cash, why is the interest so different",
    "body": "Bonds released at the same time have different interest rates because they have different levels of risks and liquidity associated. Risk will depend on the company  country  municipality that offers the bond their financial position, and their resulting ability to make future payments  avoid default. Riskier organizations must offer higher interest rates to ensure that investors remain willing to loan them money. Liquidity depends on the terms of the loan  principalonly bonds give you minimal liquidity, as there are no ongoing interest payments, and nothing received until the bonds maturity date. All bonds provide lower liquidity if they have longer maturity dates. Bonds with lower liquidity must have higher returns to compensate for the fact that you will have to give up your cash for a longer period of time. Bonds released at different times will have different interest rates because of what the general market rate for interest was in those periods. ie if a bond is released in 2016 with interest rates approaching 0, even a high risk bond would have a lower interest rate than a bond released in the 1980s, when market rates were approaching 20. Some bonds offer variable interest tied to some market indicator  those will typically have higher interest at the time of issuance, because the bondholder bears some risk that the prevailing market rate will drop. Note regarding sale of bonds after market rates have changed The value of your bonds will fluctuate with the market. If a bond was offered with 1 interest, and next year interest rates go up and a new identical bond is offered for 2 interest, when you sell your old bond you will take a loss, because the market wont want to pay full price for it anymore. Whether you should sell lowerinterest rate bonds depends on how you feel about the factors above  do you want junk bonds that have stocklike levels of returns but high risks of default, maturing in 30 years? Or do you want AAA Bonds that have essentially 0 returns maturing in 30 days? If you are paying interest on debt, it is quite likely that you could achieve a net income benefit by selling the bonds, and paying off debt [assuming your debt has a higher interest rate than your lowrate bonds]. Paying off debt is sometimes referred to as a zero risk return, because essentially there is no real risk that your lender would otherwise go bankrupt. That is, you will owe your bank the car loan until you pay it, and paying it is the only thing you can do to reduce it. However, some schools of thought suggest that maintaining savings  liquid investments makes sense even if you have some debt, because cash  liquid investments can cover you in some emergencies that credit cards cant help you with. ie if you lose your job, perhaps your credit could be pulled and you would have nothing except for your liquid savings to tide you over. How much you should save in this way is a matter of opinion, but often repeated numbers are either 3 months or 6 months worth [which is sometimes taken as x months of expenses, and sometimes as x months of aftertax income]. You should look into this issue further there are many questions on this site that discuss it, Im sure."

    "header": "What are the important differences between mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds ETFs?",
    "body": "The main difference between an ETF and a Mutual Fund is Management. An ETF will track a specific index with NO manager input. A Mutual Fund has a manager that is trying to choose securities for its fund based on the mandate of the fund. Liquidity ETFs trade like a stock, so you can buy at 10am and sell at 11 if you wish. Mutual Funds most are valued at the end of each business day, so no intraday trading. Also ETFs are similar to stocks in that you need a buyerseller for the ETF that you wanthave. Whereas a mutual funds units are sold back to itself. I do not know of many if any liquity issues with an ETF, but you could be stuck holding it if you can not find a buyer usually the market maker. Mutual Funds can be closed to trading, however it is rare. Tax treatment Both come down to the underlying holdings in the fund or ETF. However, more often in Mutual Funds you could be stuck paying someone elses taxes, not true with an ETF. For example, you buy an Equity Mutual Fund 5 years ago, you sell the fund yourself today for little to no gain. I buy the fund a month ago and the fund manager sells a bunch of the stocks they bought for it 10 years ago for a hefty gain. I have a tax liability, you do not even though it is possible that neither of us have any gains in our pocket. It can even go one step further and 6 months from now I could be down money on paper and still have a tax liability. Expenses A Mutual Fund has an MER or Management Expense Ratio, you pay it no matter what. If the fund has a positive return of 12.5 in any given year and it has an MER of 2.5, then you are up 10. However if the fund loses 7.5 with the same MER, you are down 10. An ETF has a much smaller management fee typically 0.100.95 but you will have trading costs associated with any trades. Risks involved in these as well as any investment are many and likely too long to go into here. However in general, if you have a Canadian Stock ETF it will have similar risks to a Canadian Equity Mutual Fund. I hope this helps."

In some sense, it is insurance if you have a lot of assets like maybe your human capital that will take a dive when the market goes down. Short selling would have lost a lot of money in your case as the stock market between 2011 when you wrote the question and 2014 when I wrote this answer performed very well. On average the long side stock market should make money over long periods of time as compensation for risk and the short side should lose money, so its not a good way to make money if you dont have an informational advantage.

    "body": "Gold can be thought of to have value in one of two ways 1 as a means and 2 as an end. Means takes the shape of currency. In this form, we value gold in the same way we value the dollar, it allows us to purchase things we want. As a medium of exchange, gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange. For example, I would be valuing one ingot of gold to be worth a dog if I traded a dog for one ingot of gold. The value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction. Gold as an end is valued for its own sake. A good example of this is a jeweler who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic propertys gold possesses. This is closer to the \"true value\" of gold than using it as a means, but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor. \"You know what I could use right now, a block of gold.\"  said no one ever. But even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake, this is usually done because gold provides a function. For example, if people no longer want to ware jewelry, then a jeweler will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends. To sum up, gold has a perceived value for most people and an \"intrinsic value\" to a select few for the time being."

So you might only make money if the sector exceeds that predicted growth level and vice versa, if it grows, but not that fast, you could lose money.

They arent always going to offer higher interest andor cheaper loans than the bankbanks, but theyre almost always going to be more pleasant to deal with since they consider the depositors and borrowers their stockholders, not just customers. There are minor legal differences different insurance fund, for example, and you arent necessarily eligible to open an account at a randomlychosen credit union depending on how theyve defined the community theyre serving, but they will rarely affect you as an account holder. The main downside of credit unions is that, like other small local banks, they will only have a few branches, usually within a limited geographic area. However, Ive been using a credit union 200 miles away and across two state lines on that route, one if I take a large detour for decades now, and Ive found that between bankbymail, bankbyinternet, ATM machines, and the \"branch exchange\" program which lets you use branches of participating credit unions as if they were branches of your own I really havent felt a need to get to the branch. I did find that, due to network limitations of 50KCUday, drawing 200,000 worth of bank checks on a single day when I purchased the house required running around to four separate branchexchange credit unions. But thats a weird situation where I was having trouble beating the actual numbers out of the real estate agents until a few days before the sale. And they may have relaxed those limitations since... though if I had to do it again, Id consider taking a scenic drive to hit an actual branch of my own credit union. If you have the opportunity to join a credit union, I recommend doing so. Even if you dont wind up using it for your \"main\" accounts, theyre likely to be people you want to talk to when youre shopping for a loan."

They essentially hold a second mortgage on the property for a shorter amortization 1  5 years with a higher interest rate than the bankheld mortgage. The upside for the seller is he makes a little money on the second mortgage. The downsides for the seller are that he doesnt get the entire purchase price of the property upfront, and that if the buyer goes bankrupt, the vendor will be second in line behind the bank to get any money from the property when its sold for amounts owing. Look for a seller that is willing to put together a leasetoown deal. The buyer and seller agree to a purchase price set 5 years in the future. A monthly rent is calculated such that paying it for 5 years equals a 20 down payment. At the 5 year mark you decide if you want to buy or not. If you do not, the deal is nulled. If you do, the rent you paid is counted as the down payment for the property and the sale moves forward. Find a private lender for the down payment. This is known as a \"hard money\" lender for a reason they know you cant get it anywhere else. Expect to pay higher rates than a VTB.

Is there something looming in the future that you think will require your money? If so, I would put off the purchase. No one can predict the future. Why not pay cash for it now, and pay yourself what would have been the monthly payment? In three years, you have your money back. And there is no risk at all. Also, when making large purchases with cash, you can sometimes get better discounts if you ask."

    "body": "What youre missing is the continuous compounding computation doesnt work that way. If you compound over n periods of time and a rate of return of r, the formula is ern, as you have to multiply the returns together with a mulitplicative base of 1. Otherwise consider what 0 does to your formula. If I get a zero return, I have a zero result which doesnt make sense. However, in my formula Id still get the 1 which is what Im starting and thus the no effect is the intended result. Continuous compounding would give e.2012  e2.4  .0907 which is a 91 return so for each 100 invested, the person ends up with 9.07 left at the end. It may help to picture that the function ex does asymptotically approach zero as x tends to infinity, but that is as bad as it can get, so one doesnt cross into the negative unless one wants to do returns in a Complex number system with imaginary numbers in here somehow. For those wanting the usual compounding, here would be that computation which is more brutal actually For your case it would be 1.20120.8120.068719476736 which is to say that someone ends up with 6.87 in the end. For each 100 had in the beginning they would end with 6.87 in the end. Consider someone starting with 100 and take 20 off time and time again youd see this as it would go down to 80 after the first month and then down to 64 the second month as the amount gets lower the amount taken off gets lower too. This can be continued for all 12 terms. Note that the second case isnt another 20 loss but only 16 though it is the same percentage overall. Some retail stores may do discounts on discounts so this can happen in reality. Take 50 off of something already marked down 50 and it isnt free, it is down 75 in total. Just to give a real world example where while you think a half and a half is a whole, taking half and then half of a half is only three fourths, sorry to say. You could do this with an apple or a pizza if you want a food example to consider. Alternatively, consider the classic up and down case where an investment goes up 10 and down 10. On the surface, these should cancel and negate each other, right? No, in fact the total return is down 1 as the computation would be 1.1.9.99 which is slightly less than 1. Continuous compounding may be a bit exotic from a Mathematical concept but the idea of handling geometric means and how compounding returns comes together is something that is rather practical for people to consider."

Transfer heldassets After QE  QE2, the Fed is now the holder of several assets mortgages and the like that are already unorthodox for it to hold. It acquired these assets in the first place to soak up excess demand. If these assets were transferred back to banks, it would have exactly the opposite effect  increasing supply and further suppressing the value of the assets they would be trying to shore up by lowering the interest rate. \"Print money\" The fed could raise the money supply by issuing new bonds. This is inherently inflationary, and while pretty much everyone agrees this isnt bad in the short run, there is already widespread fear that in the long run, QE by itself is going to unleash massive inflation once growth returns anyway. To keep \"pushing on this string\" would only excerabate these fears, and quite likely turn it into a selffufilling prophecy.

So yes, generally that 8 gets compounded yearly, on average. At that rate, youd get your investment doubled in roughly 9 years... on average... Of course, \"past performance cant guarantee future results\" and all that, and variation is often significant with returns that high.

Anything greater is averaged using CAGR approach. For example. The most recent 3 year period probably ending end of last month had a 6.19 averaged return. 2014, 2015, and 2016 had individual returns of 8.05, 2.47, and 9.27. Thus that total return over that three year period was 1.08051.02471.09271.21  21 return over three years. This is the same total growth that would be achieved if each year saw consistent 6.5 growth 1.0653  1.21. Not exactly the 6.19, but remember were looking at a slightly different time window.

Your credit score is high enough that you shouldnt have any problems securing a decent APR. Check your financing institutions rules on financing beyond the vehicles value. The CU that refinanced my car noted that between 100 and 120 of the vehicles value means an additional 2 APR for the life of the loan. Value between 120 and 130 incurred an additional 3 APR. Your goal here is to have the total amount of the loan less than or equal to the value of the car through the sale  tradein of your current vehicle, and paying off whatevers left out of pocket either as a downpayment, or simply paying off the existing loan.

The great thing about switching to a habit where you pay for everything using a debit or credit card is that you can skip the manual entry by importing your transactions from your bank.

In Wave, you can still enter all of your cash receipts manually if you want to continue with your current practice of cash payments. One important thing to mention, too If youre looking for a better way of doing things, make sure it includes proper backup. There would be nothing worse than entering all that data onto a spreadsheet and then something happening to your computer and you lose it all. Wave Accounting is backed up hourly and uses banklevel security to keep your information safe. One last thing as I mention above, Wave Accounting is free.

As tragic as it is to consider losing your spouse, are you truly in a position to replace everything they do you for you? Knowing what they do for you and appreciating the effort your spouse gives is important, but dont sell short the dollar amount of what they provide. Your life insurance policy should be to keep you whole. Without your spouse, you will need childcare. You might need domestic services to the home. What about a nanny or similar service? Would 50K cover that until your child is an adult? There are a number of added expenses in the short and long term that would occur if a spouse died. How much for a funeral? Obviously you know the amount and term depends on the age of your kid. But I think you should really try to account for the number of daily hours you spouse puts in, and try to attach a cost to those hours. Then buy insurance for them just as you would for a wage earning. For example, buy a policy that is 10x the annual cost for services it would take to compensate for your spouse.

    "body": "Each way you go is a little bit of a gamble. Owning equity in the company is best in situations where you can trade and sell that equity, or where the dilution of your royalty product would affect your returns, or if you can maintain a certain equity stake without working at the company or if you can hold out on taking equity to reinvest profits for the purposes of growth. The royalty is best in situations where youre getting a portion of the gross, since you get paid as a creditor, no matter how the company is performing, or if you intend to collect royalties after you leave the company. Now for your situation if your royalties are fluctuating with profit instead of gross and your equity is tied to your continued partnership and not subject to potential growth... then theyre pretty much both workarounds for the same thing, youve removed the particular advantages for each way of receiving payment. If the company ever does buy out or go public, how much of your additional X earning a month would you have to then reinvest to get an equity stake? And for royalties, if another developer came aboard, or your company bought another company, how much would this dilute your IP contribution? So, aside from the gambling nature of the issue, Im not sure your tax calculation is right. You can take equity profit as dividend, as long as youre collecting a sufficient salary this prevents a business from declaring all profits as a dividend. This would put those profits into a different tax bracket, 15 capital gains. Or if all profits are equitably split, you could take part as salary, part as dividend. As well, as someone whos making active income off of their IP, not passive income, youre supposed to file a Schedule C, not a Schedule E, so your royalties would include your self employment taxes. The schedule E is for royalties where the author isnt actively in the field or actually self employed in that area, or if you own royalties on something you didnt create. Should you keep the royalties then go to another job field or retire then your royalties could go on a Schedule E. Now, a tax advantage may exist on a Schedule C if you can write off certain health and business expenses reducing your income that you cant on a Schedule E, though itd probably be difficult to write off more than the adjusted self employment cost savings of a Schedule E."

    "body": "One of the best things you can do for this purpose, while getting a modest ROI on a passive investment, is invest in a company that profitably does whatever you want to see more of. For example, you could invest in a forprofit company that sells needed goods to lowincome people at lower prices. Something like WalMart, which is one of the most effective antipoverty engines in the US. You might also say the same of something like Aldi owner of Aldi stores and Trader Joes, which is a discount store chain. This is true even though a company like WalMart is seeking to make money first. Its customer base tends to skew heavily towards lowincome consumers, and historically to rural and elderly consumers. When WalMart is able to provide food, clothing, appliances and the like to poor people at a lower cost, it is making it marginally less painful to have a low income. Peter Suderman can explain why WalMart is a humanitarian enterprise Walmarts customer base is heavily concentrated in the bottom income quintile, which spends heavily on food. The bottom income quintile spends about 25 percent of income on food compared to just 3.5 percent for the top quintile. So the benefits of Walmarts substantially lower prices to the lowest earning cohort are huge, especially on food. As Suderman points out, this view of WalMart dramatically lowering prices that lowincome people pay for food was corroborated by an Obama adviser. Thats just one company. You can pick the industry and company that best suits your personal preferences. Alternatively, you could invest in something like Whole Foods, a company with multiple missions to improve the planet and the community, in addition to the more typical mission of being a prosperous retail chain. Of course, as a general proposition, a less than entirely altruistic, charityinclined investment doesnt need to be targeted at those with low incomes or at saving the planet. You could invest in almost anything you think is good yachts, yoyos, violins, energy production, industrial inputs, music performances and the company will take care of making more of that good thing. You didnt say whether your goal was to help the poor, the planet, arts, sciences, knowledge, community, or whatever. What I understand you to be saying is you are willing to accept a lower ROI in exchange for some warmfuzzies from your investment. That seems perfectly valid and reasonable to me, but it makes it much more subjective and particular to your tastes. So youll need to pick something thats meaningful to you. If youre going to trade ROI for positive feelings, then you should pick whatever gives you your optimal blend of emotions and returns. Alternatively, you could invest in something stable and predictable to beat inflation some sort of index or fund and then annually use some portion of those profits to simply give to the charity of your choice. Your investment and your charity do not necessarily need to be the same vehicle."

It might never have a similar dividend again. What youre basically looking at with that chart is a list of recently wellperforming funds  funds who had a good year. They obviously may or may not have such a good year next year. You also have funds that are dividendheavy intended explicitly to return significant dividends. Those may return large dividends, but could still fall in value significantly. Look at ACP for example its currently trading near its 2year low. You got a nice dividend, but the price dropped quite a bit, so you lost a chunk of that money. I dont know if ACP is a dividendheavy fund, but it looks like it might be. GFs chart is also indicative of something interesting it fell off a cliff right after it gave its dividend at the end of the year. Dropped 4. I think thats because this is a mutual fund priced based on the NAV of its holdings  so it dividended some of those holdings, which dropped the share price and the NAV of the fund by that amount. IE, 18 a share, 4 a share dividend, so after that 14 a share. The rest of the dividends are from stock holdings which pay dividends themselves, if I understand properly. Has a similar drop in Dec 2013. They may simply be trying to keep the price of the fund in the 15 a share range I suspect but dont know that some funds have in their charter a requirement to stay in a particular range and dividend excess value."

If you want to leave, you can step out of it. Now we look at a deeper hole, 3 feet. Now youre still not too concerned. You cant just walk out, but if you need to get out you can wiggle your way up. 6 feet. Now you start getting nervous. Climbing out is getting trickier and trickier. You may not be able to move in response to a changing enviornment around you, because youre stuck in a hole. Now make the hole 10 feet. Now you cant reach the edges. Now youre in trouble. You have lost all mobility. You cant get out under your own power. Now if something bad happens such as losing your job or a sudden health issue, you cant move around to solve the problem. This is the issue that arise from underwater mortgages. Say you lose your job because the job market in your area dried up think Detroit in the big auto manufacturer crash. You need to move. You are legally endebted to a lender for your existing underwater house by more than you can sell it for. You need to pay for the privilege to sell it. You still owe payments on it, so if you just buy a new house or rent in the new state, youre paying for twice as much property. You cant just shuffle the underwaterness from your old house to your new house because the new lender has no interest in giving a loan for more than the value of the new home. The only options you have to play with is renting the old house, which many underwater families did, or bankrupcy. If the area you were in is depressed, you may not be able to rent the house for enough to cover your mortgage. This is the fear of being underwater. You have a piece of paper which claims some lender can take money from you that you may or may not have, and that the US government will allow them to take your assets, if need be, to settle the score. If youre underwater by a few thousand, its typically not a big deal. If youre underwater by 80 or 90 thousand dollars, which some people were, thats a lot of money to be endebted for without the assets to recover them. If you subscribe to the realtor story that the market will recover, all you have to do is scrape by, holding on, until the market rises again. However, those who are underwater recognize that the reason much of this occurred is that we entered a bubble because realtors kept saying the market could only go up. Fool me once...."

The 365 put is \"out of the money.\" The stock has to fall 11 more before the put is exercised. But if the stock went down 8 points today, that is less than the 19 difference at the start of the day. Because there is time between now and October, there is a chance for the stock to go down further, thereby going into the money. The current value of the put is represented by this \"chance.\" Obviously, the chances of the stock going down 11 more from today is greater than the chance of it going down 19 more.

Your choices now are Quicken and Mint along with the several opensource programs that have been listed by others. In the past, I found the open source programs to be both clunky and not featurecomplete for my every day use. Its possible they have improved significantly since I had last looked at them. The biggest limitation I saw with them is weakness of integration with financial service providers banks, credit card companies, brokerage accounts, etc. Lets start with Mint. Mint is a webbased tool owned by the same company as Quicken whose main feature is its ability to connect to nearly every financial institution youre likely to use. Mint aggregates that data for you and presents it on the homepage. This makes it very easy to see your net worth and changes to it over time, spending trends, track your progress on budgets and longterm goals, etc. Mint allows you to do all of this with little or no data entry. It has support for your investments but does not allow for deep analysis of them. Quicken is a desktop program. It is extremely feature rich in terms of supporting different types of accounts, transactions, reports, reconciliation, etc. One could use Quicken to do everything that I just described about Mint, but the power of Quicken is in its more manual features. For example, while Mint is centred on showing you your status, Quicken allows you to enter transactions in realtime as youre writing a check, initiating a transfer, etc and later reconciles them with data from your financial institutions. Link Mint, Quicken has good integration with financial companies so you can generally get away with as little or as much data entry as you want. For example, you can manually enter large checks and transfers and later match to automaticallydownloaded data but allow small entries like credit card purchases to download automatically. Bottom line, if youre just looking to keep track of where you are at, try Mint. Its very simple and free. If you need more power and want to manage your finances on a more transactional level, try Quicken though I believe they do not have a trial version, I dont understand why. The learning curve is steep although probably gentler than that of GnuCash. Last note on why Mint.com is free its the usual adsupported model, plus Mint sells aggregated consumer behaviour reports to other institutions since Mint has everyones transactions, it can identify consumer trends. If youre not comfortable with that, or with the idea of giving a website passwords to all your financial accounts, you will find Quicken easier to accept. Hope this helps."

    "body": "Legally, do I have anything to worry about from having an incorrectly filed W4? What you did wasnt criminal. When you submitted the form it was correct. Unfortunately as your situation changed you didnt adjust the form, that mistake does have consequences. Is there anything within my rights I can do to get the company to take responsibility for their role in this situation, or is it basically my fault? It is basically your fault. The company needs a w4 for each employee. They will use that W4 for every paycheck until the government changes the regulation, or your employment ends, or you submit a new form. Topic 753  Form W4  Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate If an employee qualifies, he or she can also use Form W4 PDF to tell you not to deduct any federal income tax from his or her wages. To qualify for this exempt status, the employee must have had no tax liability for the previous year and must expect to have no tax liability for the current year. However, if the employee can be claimed as a dependent on a parents or another persons tax return, additional limitations may apply refer to the instructions for Form W4. A Form W4 claiming exemption from withholding is valid for only the calendar year in which it is filed with the employer. To continue to be exempt from withholding in the next year, an employee must give you a new Form W4 claiming exempt status by February 15 of that year. If the employee does not give you a new Form W4, withhold tax as if he or she is single, with no withholding allowances. However, if you have an earlier Form W4 not claiming exempt status for this employee that is valid, withhold as you did before. I highlighted the key part Because you were claiming exempt they should have required you to update that form each year. In your case that may not have applied because of the timing of the events. When do you submit a new form? Anytime your situation changes. Sometimes the change is done to adjust withholding to modify the amount of a refund. Other times failure to update the form can lead to bigger complication when your marital status changes, or the number of dependents changes. In these situations you could have a significant amount of underwithheld, which could lead to a fine later on. As a side note this is even more true for the state version of a W4. Having a whole years worth of income tax withholding done for the wrong state will at a minimum require you to file in multiple states, it could also result in a big surprise if the forgotten state has higher tax rate. Will my now former employee be responsible for paying their portion of the taxes that were not withheld during the 9 months I was fulltime, tax Exempt? For federal and state income taxes they are just a conduit. They take the money from your paycheck, and periodically send it to the IRS and the state capital. Unless you could show that the pay stubs said taxes were being withheld, but the w2 said otherwise they have no role in judging the appropriateness of your W4 with one exception. Finally, and I am not too hopeful on this one, but is there anything I can do to ease this tax burden? I understand that the IRS is owed no matter what. You have one way it might workout. For many taxpayers who have a large increase in pay from one year to the next, they can take advantage of a safeharbor in the tax law. If they had withheld as much money in 2015 as they paid in 2014, they have reached the safeharbor. They avoid the penalty for under withholding. Note that 2014 number is not what you paid on tax day or what was refunded, but all your income taxes for the entire year. Because in your case your taxes for the year 2014 were ZERO, that might mean that you automatically reach the safeharbor for 2015. That makes sense because one of the key requirements of claiming exempt is that you had no liability the year before. It wont save you from paying what you owe but it can help avoid a penalty.

Unless there are specific reasons for wanting to invest in your new employers 401k e.g. you can buy your employers stock at discounted rates within the 401k, and this is a good investment according to your friends, neighbors, and brothersinlaw, you would be much better off moving the 403b money into an IRA, where you have many more choices for investment and usually can manage to find investments with lower investment costs e.g. mutual fund fees than in a typical employers 401k plan. On the other hand, 401k assets are better protected than IRA assets in case you are sued and a court finds you to be liable for damages the plaintiff cannot come after the 401k assets if you cannot pay. To answer the question of \"how?\", you need to talk to the HR people at your current employer to make sure that they are willing to accept a rollover from another taxdeferred plan not all plans are agreeable to do this and get any paperwork from them, especially making sure that you find out where the check is to be sent, and to whom it should be payable. Then, talk to your previous employers HR people and tell them that you want to roll over your 403b money into the 401k plan of your new employer, fill out the paperwork, make sure they know to whom to cut the check to, and where it is to be sent etc. In my personal experience, I was sent the check payable to the custodian of my new IRA account, and I had to send it on to the custodian my 403b people refused to send the check directly to the new custodian. The following January, you will receive a 1099R form from your 403b plan showing the amount transferred to the new custodian, with hopefully the correct code letter indicating that the money was rolled over into another taxdeferred account."

    "body": "I actually love this question, and have hashed this out with a friend of mine where my premise was that at some volume of money it must be advantageous to simply track the index yourself. There some obvious touchpoints Most people dont have anywhere near the volume of money required for even a 5 commission outweigh the large index fund expense ratios. There are logistical issues that are massively reduced by holding a fund when it comes to winding down your investments as you get near retirement age. Index funds are not touted as categorically \"the best\" investment, they are being touted as the best place for the average person to invest. There is still a management component to an index like the SP500. The index doesnt simply buy a share of Apple and watch it over time. The SP 500 isnt simply a single share of each of the 500 larges US companies its market cap weighted with frequent rebalancing and constituent changes. VOO makes a lot of trades every day to track the SP index, \"passive index investing\" is almost an oxymoron. The most obvious part of this is that if index funds were \"the best\" way to invest money Berkshire Hathaway would be 100 invested in VOO. The argument for \"passive index investing\" is simplified for public consumption. The reality is that over time large actively managed funds have underperformed the large index funds net of fees. In part, the thrust of the advice is that the average person is, or should be, more concerned with their own endeavors than they are managing their savings. Investment professionals generally want to avoid \"How come I my money only returned 4 when the market index returned 7? If you track the index, you wont do worse than the index this helps people sleep better at night. In my opinion the dirty little secret of index funds is that they are able to charge so much less because they spend 0 making investment decisions and 0 on researching the quality of the securities they hold. They simply track an index XYZ company is 0.07 of the index, then the fund carries 0.07 of XYZ even if the manager thinks something shady is going on there. The argument for a majority of your funds residing in Mutual FundsETFs is simple, When youre of retirement age do you really want to make decisions like should I sell a share of Amazon or a share of Exxon? Wouldnt you rather just sell 2 units of SRQ Index fund and completely maintain your investment diversification and not pay commission? For this simplicity you give up three basis points?

Now, what all of these \"quality of life\" features dont do is mitigate your responsibility, as outlined when you first took out the loan, to pay it back in a timely manner and according to the terms and conditions of the loan. If your original contract for the loan states you shall make \"a payment of X.XX each calendar month\", then you are required to make that payment one way or another. If autopay fails, you are still obligated to monitor that and correct the payment to ensure you meet your contractual obligation.

In almost all cases, you can save considerable interest by making extra payments towards the principal. Be careful though, some lenders require you to specifically mark the payment to be applied to the loan principal and if you dont designate it as such, they will just apply it as an early payment for future months and not reduce your balance until that future payment is due, which doesnt help at all. Another option to reduce your total interest costs, though more common for larger loans like mortgages, is to split the payment into multiple parts and pay more than once a month instead of a single payment each month. This only works if they calculate interest daily and would be useless if they do it monthly. They key is knowing the terms of your loan. Despite it not being in their best interest pun intended, most lenders will work with you on a strategy to help you minimize the interest cost in the name of customer service."

Vesting these are the strings attached to the grant. As long as youre employed by the company, your options will vest every quarter, proportionally. Youll become an owner of 4687 or 4688 options every quarter. Each such vest event means youd be getting an opportunity to buy the corresponding amount of stocks at the strike price and not the current market price which may be higher. Buying is called exercising. Exercising a nonqualified option is a taxable event, and youll be taxed on the value of the \"gift\" you got. The value is determined by the difference between the strike price the price at which you have the option to buy the stock and the actual fair market value of the stock at the time of vest based on valuations. Options that are vested are yours depending on the grant contract, read it carefully, leaving the company may lead to forfeiture. Options that are not vested will disappear once you leave the company. Exercised options become stocks, and are yours. Qualified vs Nonqualifed  refers to the tax treatment. Nonqualified options dont have any special treatment, qualified do. 3.02M stocks issued refers to the value of the options. Consider the total valuation of the company being 302M. With 302M value and 3.02M stocks issued, each stock is worth 100. Now, in a year, a new investor comes in, and another 3.02M stocks are issued if, for example, the new investor wants a 50 stake. In this case, there will be 6.04M stocks issued, for 302M value  each stock is worth 50 now. That is called dilution. Your grant is in nominal options, so in case of dilution, the value of your options will go down. Additional points If the company is not yet public, selling the stocks may be difficult, and you may own pieces of paper that noone else wants to buy. You will still pay taxes based on the valuations and you may end up paying for these pieces of paper out of your own pocket. In California, it is illegal to not pay salary to regular employees.

    "body": "I think youre talking about two types of machines, at least in the United States. The term change machine usually refers to a machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins. Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as bill changers. Exactly what bills or coins these machines return depends on the machine. Read the instructions on the machine to get the details theyre usually right on the machine. For example my apartment building has a machine that converts small bills like ones and fives to quarters, since the laundry machines only took quarters. The other type of machine are coincashing machines, like the Coinstar machines you might see at a grocery store. Many banks used to have these machines as well although in my area theyre few and far between now. These machines perform the opposite function of the traditional change machine and convert smaller denominations mostly coins into bill form. For example if you dump all your accumulated pennies into the machine, it will probably give you bills and larger coins like quarters, dimes, nickels in exchange, after subtracting a small fee. Ive heard that now, some of these machines may give you a gift card of some kind instead of bills, although theyll still subtract a fee from your original amount, usually. Once again just read the instructions and they should tell you. When my bank had one of these machines, they didnt charge a fee as long as you were a customer at the bank. Im sure that varies from place to place and bank to bank though. Wikipedias article has this to say see the article for references In some sections of the U.S., regional banks have begun offering free coincounting services in the amount of a gift card. Refunds are often given in cash rather than in the form of a gift card. In some cases, it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders. TD Banks \"Penny Arcade\" coin counters were free and available to both customers and noncustomers in many branches, but as of November 2010, the bank charges a 6 fee for noncustomers to use the machine."

    "header": "Why doesnt every company and individual use taxhavens to pay less taxes?",
    "body": "I believe that an understanding of the taxation system can help to understand our place in it, and how that impacts each of our personal finances. I will try to remain unbiased here but this is a somewhat subjective question, so please bear with me if you disagree on any point. Some of these tax savings are welladvertised, and can be used by many people, such as tax credits for masstransit passes which exists in some countries. But some of these tax savings are things you never heard of before, until it winds up on the news. Why do some people seem to get tax savings that you and I cannot get, and why do those people always seem to have so much more money than us? A simplistic answer can show this in three parts 1 The source of ones income 2 Transaction costs and 3 \"tax loopholes\". Tax savings occur proportionately to ones income, and if the savings apply to investment income, they occur proportionately to ones wealth. If someone living paycheck to paycheck with a minimal amount in a bank account \"saves tax on investment income\", they might reduce their taxable interest from 50 to 0. Thats because they simply dont have any other investment income to reduce. All of their income comes in the form of employment, which is typically very hard to save taxes on. Most governments have a very firm grasp on the taxation of employment income, because it is a huge proportion of income in the country and therefore has the largest amount of tax associated, and because it is very straightforward work for someone  employment income. A more cynical person than I might point out that investment income is earned by the very wealthy, who can afford to lobby for politicians to pass favourable investment income laws. Even very straightforward tax saving opportunities may cost money to enable. The simplest example would be if a tax saving opportunity is so complicated that an average person cant understand it themselves, then an accountant, lawyer, or banker will need to be the one to explain it. And that can cost you money. If your tax isnt so much to begin with, then the transaction costs to achieve the tax savings could be higher than the tax savings themselves. For example, most countries have tax savings  deferrals if you start a corporation. These rules typically exist to promote investment in the local economy. But someone who earns 10k in a sidebusiness might not be able to afford the 3k in incorporation costs just to save 2k in taxes. The more income and wealth you have, the more these transaction costs become worthwhile. Im going to generally define \"tax loopholes\" for the purposes of this answer as something where a somewhat arbitrary situation allows for taxes that a layman would consider unfair or unexpected. This often occurs with good intentions but poor legislation  the government tries to provide a benefit to a deserving group or to promote an activity, but ends up allowing another group to take advantage. For example in Canada, there existed until a few years ago tax saving rules about passing on wealth to children at lower tax rates, only when a close family member is neardeath [setting up a testamentary trust between a grandparent and a grandchild could in some circumstances allow that trust to be created with additional tax brackets, meaning more income would be taxed at a lessthan top tax rate before being distributed to the grandchildren]. The rules were put in place with the idea that \"oh gee, a family member has died, and the dang ol family is grieving so hard they cant distribute the wealth to the next generation for a few months on account of all the crying. We should make it so that the estate is taxed like a person, and if they earn only a little income, they have a low tax rate, and they only get taxed at the full rate if they have a lot of income\". Seems reasonable enough, but if a family is ready to pass on wealth at the same time as someone is nudging the bucket with their foot, a morbid discussion with your lawyer and accountant could set your children up for life with forever reduced taxes on massive inheritances. In the case of the Panama  Paradise leaks, tax savings are due to all 3 of the above Those who have massive wealth and therefore earn the majority of their income from investments instead of employment can afford the transaction costs associated with taking advantage of specific \"tax loopholes\". The simplest example of which is just that income earned in a foreign country might have a lower tax rate than income earned domestically. This is often a result of \"cracks\" in the foreign tax treaties between countries, which exist generally to promote business between countries and prevent doubletaxing individuals who need activity in both countries for whatever reason. Take for example the \"Apple loophole\". Apple has operations around the world. Some activity occurs in lowtax jurisdictions. Apple reports a high percentage of the value of RD as being associated with those jurisdictions. Those branches in lowtax jurisdictions charge the hightax branches such as the US with fees for use of their valuable research. So much of Apples income is reported in those foreign jurisdictions. It wont be taxed in the US until Apple \"repatriates\" the cash back to the US. Until then, the cash sits in the foreign jurisdiction, accruing less tax. This and similar rules can be used by individuals wealthy enough to hold corporations in foreign jurisdictions with low tax rates. How each particular rule  \"loophole\" works will depend on the nature of a specific case  tax law is complex, and the rules between countries are even more so. These foreign tax loopholes are closing every year. It is getting harder and harder to hide money offshore, and it is getting less and less likely that you will be able to find a country with juuuust the right loopholes for your own offshore wealth. These types of news leaks will only help to expedite those changes."

    "header": "I earn 75K, have 30K in savings, no debt, rent from my parents who are losing their home. Should I buy a home now or save?",
    "body": "For the vast majority, \"buying\" a house via a mortgage is not an investment. I use quotes around buying because from a technical perspective you dont own anything until youve paid it off this is often an important point that people forget. Its highly unlikely youll make more on it than the amount you put into it interest, repairs, etc. Even with relatively low interest rates. The people who successfully invest in homes are those that use actual cash not borrowed to buy a home at well below market value. They then clean it up and make enough repairs to make it marketable and sell it shortly there after. Sometimes these people get hosed if the housing market tumbles to the point that the home is now worth less than the amount they put into it. This is especially problematic if they used bank loans to get the process going. They were actually the hardest hit when the housing bubble popped several years ago. Well, them and the people who bought on interest only loans or had balloon payments. Whereas the people who use a mortgage are essentially treating it like a bank account with a negative interest rate. For example, 180k loan on a 30 yr fixed at 4 will mean a total payout of around 310k, excluding normal repairs like roofs, carpet, etc. Due to how mortgages work, most of the interest is collected during the first half of the loan period. So selling it within 2 to 5 years is usually problematic unless the local housing market has really skyrocketed. Housing markets move up and down all the time due to a hundred different things completely out of your control. It might be a regional depression, weather events, failed large businesses, failed citylocal governments, etc. It could go up because businesses moved in, a new highway is built, statelocal taxes decline, etc. My point is, homes are not long term investments. They can be short term ones, but only in limited circumstances and there is a high degree of risk involved. So dont let that be a driving point of your decision. Instead you need to focus on other factors. Such as what is really going on with the house you are currently in? Why would they lose it? Can you help out, and, should you help out? If things are precarious, it might make more sense to sell that home now and everyone move into separate locations, possibly different rentals or apartments. If they are foreclosed on then they will be in a world of financial hurt for a long time. If we ignore your parents situation, then one piece of advice I would give you is this Rent the cheapest apartment you can find that is still a \"safe\" place to live in. Put every dollar you can into some type of savingsinvestment that will actually grow. Stay there for 5 years, then go pay cash for a nice home. Making 75k a year while single means that you dont need much to live on. In other words, live extremely cheap now so you can enjoy a fantastic living experience later that is free from financial fear. You should be able to put 30k per year aside going this route. edit A bit of support data for those that somehow think buying a home on a mortgage is somehow a good investment Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel prize in economics and who predicted the bursting of the housing bubble, has shown that a house is not a good investment. Why? First, home prices adjusted for inflation have been virtually unchanged for the past 100 years. link 1, link 2 Second, after you add in the costs of maintenance alone then those costs plus what youve paid for the home will exceed what you get out of it. Adding in the cost of a mortgage could easily double or even triple the price you paid which makes things even worse. Maintenance costs include things like a new roof, carpetflooring, water heater, appliances, etc. Yes, a home might cost you 100k and you might sell it for 200k after 15 years. However during that time youll likely replace the roof 10k to 20k, replace appliances 2k to 5k, water heater 1k, carpetflooring 5k to 20k, paint 3k to 6k, and mortgage related costs 60k  assuming 30 yr fixed 4. So your \"costs\" are between 180k and 200k just on those items. There are many more that could easily escalate the costs further. Like a fence 5k, air conditioner 5k, windows, etc. The above is assuming the home actually appreciates in value faster than inflation which they historically havent over the long term. So you have to consider all of the costs ultimately paid to purchase and maintain the home vs the costs of renting during the same time period. Point is do your research and be realistic about it. Buying a home is a huge financial risk."

    "header": "UK university student finance  should I use my sponsorship money to pay the debt?",
    "body": "Let me run some simplistic numbers, ignoring inflation. You have the opportunity to borrow up to 51K. What matters and varies is your postgraduation salary. Case 1  you make 22K after graduation. You pay back 90 a year for 30 years, paying off at most 2700 of the loan. In this case, whether you borrow 2,800 or 28,000 makes no difference to the payingoff. You would do best to borrow as much as you possibly can, treating it as a grant. Case 2  you make 100K after graduation. You pay back over 7K a year. If you borrowed the full 51, after 7 or 8 years it would be paid off yeah, yeah, inflation, interest, but maybe that might make it 9 years. In this case, the more you borrow the more you have to pay back, but you can easily pay it back, so you dont care. Invest your sponsorships and savings into something long term since you know you wont be needing to draw on them. Case 3  you make 30K after graduation. Here, the payments you have to make actually impact how much disposable income you have. You pay back 810 a year, and over 30 years thats about 25K of principal. It will be less if you account for some even most of the payment going to interest, not principal. Anything you borrow above 25K or the lower, more accurate amount is \"free\". If you borrow substantially less than that by using your sponsorship, savings, and summer job you may be able to stop paying sooner than 30 years. But even if you borrow only 12K or half the more accurate number, it will still be 15 years of payments. Running slightly more realistic versions of these calculations where your salary goes up, and you take interest into account, I think you will discover, for each possible salary path, a number that represents how much of your loan is really loan everything above that is actually a grant you do not pay back. The less you are likely to make, the more of it is really grant. On top of that, it seems to me that no matter the loangrant ratio, \"borrow as much as you can from this rather bizarre source\" appears to be the correct answer. In the cases where its all loan, you have a lot of income and dont care much about this loan payment. Borrowing the whole 51K lets you invest all the money you get while youre a student, and you can use the returns on those investments to make the loan payments."

So if you were closing a long position you would sell it. Closed Short  is when you close out a short position. Short means that you sell to open and buy back to close. With a short position you are trying to profit as the price falls. Scaled Out  means you get out of a position in increments as the price climbs for long positions. Scaled In  means you set a target price and then invest in increments as the stock falls below that price for long positions."

    "body": "Based on past case law, a check made payable to qualified charity and delivered e.g., placed in the mail on 1231 would count as delivered as it is out of the hands of the donor would fall under the \"constructive receipt doctrine\". However, for noncharitable gifts e.g., gifts to family members it is the date the check is cashed honored by the receiving bank. This is important as the annual gift exclusion is just that \"Annual\". Therefore, if I gift my child 14,000 by writing a check on 12312014 but they deposit it on 132015 then I have used my annual gift exclusion for 2015 and not 2014. This means I could not gift them anything further in 2015. BTW the annual gift amount is for ALL gifts cash and noncash. Most people dont seem to realize this. If I give 14,000 of cash to my child and then also give them Christmas gifts with a value of 1,000 I have exceeded my annual gift exclusion to that child. Usually there are ways around this issue as I can give 14,000 to each and every person I want and if married my spouse can do the same. This allows us to give 14,000 from each of us to each child plus 14,000 from each of us to their spouse if married and 14,000 from each of us to each of their children if they have any."

    "header": "How does a public company issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders?",
    "body": "Lets say the company has a million shares valued at 10 each, so market caps is 10 million dollar  10 per share. Actual value of the company is unknown, but should be close to that 10 million if the shares are not overvalued or undervalued. If they issue 100,000 more shares at 10 each, the buyers pay a million dollar. Which goes into the bank account of the company. Which is now worth a million dollar more than before. Again, we dont know what it is worth, but the market caps should go up to 11 million dollar. And since you have now 1,100,000 shares, its still 10 per share. If the shares are sold below or above 10, then the share price should go down or up a bit. Worst case, if the company needs money, cant get a loan, and sells 200,000 shares for 5 each to raise a million dollars, there will be suspicion that the company is in trouble, and that will affect the share price negatively. And of course the share price should have dropped anyway because the new value is 11,000,000 for 1,200,000 shares or 9.17 per share."

    "header": "How do you quantify investment risk?",
    "body": "I use two measures to define investment risk Whats the longest period of time over which this investment has had negative returns? Whats the worstcase fall in the value of this investment peak to trough? I find that the former works best for longterm investments, like retirement. As a concrete example, I have most of my retirement money in equity, since the Sensex has had zero returns over as long as a decade. Since my investment timeframe is longer, equity is riskfree, by this measure. For shortterm investments, like money put aside to buy a car next year, the second measure works better. For this purpose, I might choose a debt fund that isnt the safest, and has had a worstcase 8 loss over the past decade. I can afford that loss, putting in more money from my pocket to buy the car, if needed. So, I might choose this fund for this purpose, taking a slight risk to earn higher return. In any case, how much money I need for a car can only be a rough guess, so having 8 less than originally planned may turn out to be enough. Or it may turn out that the entire amount originally planned for is insufficient, in which case a further 8 shortfall may not be a big deal. These two measures Ive defined are simple to explain and understand, unlike academic stuff like beta, standard deviation, information ratio or other mumbojumbo. And they are simple to apply to a practical problem, as Ive illustrated with the two examples above. On the other hand, if someone tells me that the standard deviation of a mutual fund is 15, Ill have no idea what that means, or how to apply that to my financial situation. All this suffers from the problem of being limited to historical data, and the future may not be like the past. But that affects any risk statistic, and you cant do better unless you have a time machine."

    "body": "It depends. Dividends and fees are usually unrelated. If the ETF holds a lot of stocks which pay significant dividends e.g. an SP500 index fund these will probably cover the cost of the fees pretty readily. If the ETF holds a lot of stocks which do not pay significant dividends e.g. growth stocks there may not be any dividends  though hopefully there will be capital appreciation. Some ETFs dont contain stocks at all, but rather some other instruments e.g. commoditytrust ETFs which hold precious metals like gold and silver, or dailyleveraged ETFs which hold options. In those cases there will never be any dividends. And depending on the performance of the market, the capital appreciation may or may not cover the expenses of the fund, either. If you look up QQQs financials, youll find it most recently paid out a dividend at an annualized rate of 0.71. Its expense ratio is 0.20. So the dividends more than cover its expense ratio. You could also ask \"why would I care?\" because unless youre doing some prettydarnedspecific taxrelated modeling, it doesnt matter much whether the ETF covers its expense ratio via dividends or whether it comes out of capital gains. You should probably be more concerned with overall returns for QQQ in the most recent year, 8.50  which easily eclipses the dividends."

    "body": "1 Gambling losses not in excess of gambling winnings can be deducted on Schedule A, line 28. See Pub 17 p 201. Line 28 catches lots of deductions, and gambling losses are one of them. See Schedule A instructions. 2 If the Mississippi state tax withheld was an income tax which I assume it was, then it goes on Schedule A, line 5a. In the unlikely event it was not a state or local tax on income, but some sort of excise on gambling, then it may be deductible on line 8 as another deductible tax. It probably is not a personal property tax, which is generally levied against the value of things like cars and other movable property but not on receipts of cash line 7 probably is not appropriate. The most likely result, without researching Mississippi SALT, is that it was an income tax. See Sched A Instructions for more on the differences between the types of taxes paid. Just to be clear, these statements hold if you are not engaging in poker as a profession. If you are engaging in poker as a business, which can be difficult to establish in the IRS eyes, then you would use Schedule C and also report business and travel expenses. But the IRS is aware that people want to reduce their gambling income by the cost of hotels and flights to casinos, so its a relatively high hurdle to be considered a professional poker player."

To do this, the fund will buy the same stocks in the same proportions as the weighting of the Index. The SP 500 Index is freefloat capitalization weighted. This means that the higher capitalization stocks based on publicly traded shares only are more heavily weighted and factor into the Index value more heavily than the smaller capitalization stocks, or the stocks that have a smaller publicly traded value. For example, companies like Apple, ExxonMobil, and Microsoft have a much larger weight in the index value than smaller companies. Alternatively, there are some SP index funds that are equalweighted. In these funds, the managers have chosen to purchase all 500 of the stocks in the index, but in equal proportions instead of the weighted proportions of the index. These equalweighted funds will not as closely match the index price as the traditionally weighted index funds. Instead, they might do better or worse than the index, depending on how the individual stocks do. Youll need to look at the prospectus of the index funds you are interested in to see which approach the fund is taking."

This stock shall be partly paid up. Usually, these stocks are issued in different circumstances, for example as part payment for debentures, preference shares or other capital structuring. On the other hand for a fully paid up share no more money needs to be paid by you or no other adjustments need to be made. So, above, the company is issuing you with stocks for which you will need to pay no further money, they are fully paid for. Authorized Capital Authorized capital of a company is the amount of money a company can raise by selling stock not debt, equity. This number is registered when the company is incorporated, subsequently, this number can be revised upward by applying to the registrar of companies. Now, this means that at max. the company is authorized to raise this much capital and no more. However, a company may raise less than this, which is called Issued Capital. In your case, the company is raising its authorized capital by applying to the registrar of companies, though in this case they are looking at their full authorized capital to be issued capital, it was not necessary to do so. Increase of Authorized capital The main benefit is that the company can get more money in form of equity and utilize the same, perhaps, for expansion of business etc., that is the primary benefit. Bonus Share Usually, companies keep some surplus as reserve, this money comes out of the profit the company makes and is essentially money of the shareholders. This reserve surplus is maintained for situations, when the money may be required for exigencies. However, this surplus grows over a few years and the company usually the company plans for an expansion of business. However, this money cannot be just taken, as it belongs to the shareholder, so shareholders are issued extra equity in proportion to their current holding and this surplus is capitalized i.e. used as part of the companys equity capital.

    "body": "I think the first misconception to clear up is that you are implying the price of a stock is set by a specific person. It is not. The price of a stock is equal to the value that someone most recently traded at. If Apple last traded at 100share, then Apple shares are worth 100. If good news about Apple hits the market and people holding the shares ask for more money, and the most recent trade becomes 105, then that is now what Apple shares are worth. Remember that generally speaking, the company itself does not sell you its shares  instead, some other investor sells you shares they already own. When a company sells you shares, it is called a public offering. To get to your actual question, saying something is priced in implies that the market that is, investors who are buying and selling shares in the company has already considered the impacts of that something. For example, if you open up your newspaper and read an article about IBM inventing a new type of computer chip, you might want to invest in IBM. But, the rest of the market has also heard the news. So everyone else has already traded IBM assuming that this new chip would be made. That means when you buy, even if sales later go up because of the new chip, those sales were already considered by the person who chose the price to sell you the shares at. One principle of the stock market not agreed to by all is called market efficiency. Generally, if there were perfect market efficiency, then every piece of public information about a company would be perfectly integrated into its stock price. In such a scenario, the only way to get real value when buying a company would be to have secret information of some sort. It would mean that everyones collective bestguess about what will happen to the company has been \"pricedin\" to the most recent share trade."

    "body": "Unless a study accounts for whether the users are following a budget or not, it is irrelevant to those who are trying to take their personal finances seriously. I can certainly believe that those who have no budget will spend more on a credit card than they will on a debit card or with cash. Under the right circumstances spending with cards can actually be a tool to track and reduce spending. If you can see on a monthly and yearly basis where all of your money was spent, you have the information to make decisions about the small expenses that add up as well as the obvious large expenses. Debit cards and credit cards offer the same advantage of giving you an electronic record of all of your transactions, but debit cards do not come with the same fraud protection that credit cards have, so I and many people like me prefer to use credit cards for security reasons alone. Cash back and other rewards points bolster the case for credit cards over debit cards. It is very possible to track all of your spending with cash, but it is also more work. The frustration of accounting for bad transcriptions and rechecking every transaction multiple times is worth discussing too as a reason that people get discouraged and give up on budgeting. My point is simply that credit cards and the electronic records that they generate can greatly simplify the process of tracking your spending. I doubt any study out there accounts for the people who are specifically using those benefits and what effect it has on their spending."

Essentially, you are gambling that 1 your income will \"grow\" into your mortgage, and thats counting income from renting part of the property or 2 the house will rise in value, thereby bailing you out. That was a gamble that many Americans took, and lost, in the past ten years. If you do this, you may be one of the \"lucky\" ones, you may not, but you are really taking your future in your hands. The American rule of thumb is that your mortgage should be no more than 2.53 times income, that is maybe up to 150,000. Perhaps 200,000 if 50,000 or so of that is interest free.

Once youve repaired your credit, the scammer can just go through his old files and do it all over again. 4.

    "body": "Here is an example for you. We have a fictional company. Its called MoneyCorp. Its job is to own money, and thats all. Right now it owns 10,000. It doesnt do anything special with that 10,000  it stores it in a bank account, and whenever it earns interest gives it to the shareholders as a dividend. Also, it doesnt have any expenses at all, and doesnt pay taxes, and is otherwise magic so that it doesnt have to worry about distractions from its mathematical perfection. There are 10,000 shares of MoneyCorp, each worth exactly 1. However, they may trade for more or less than 1 on the stock market, because its a free market and people trading stock on the stock market can trade at whatever price two people agree on. Scenario 1. MoneyCorp wants to expand. They sell 90,000 shares for 1 each. The money goes in the same bank account at the same interest rate. Do the original shareholders see a change? No. 100,000 shares, 100,000, still 1share. No problem. This is the ideal situation. Scenario 2 MoneyCorp sells 90,000 shares for less than the current price, 0.50 each. Do the original shareholders lose out? YES. It now has something like 55,000 and 100,000 shares. Each share is now worth 0.55. The company has given away valuable equity to new shareholders. Thats bad. Why didnt they get more money from those guys? Scenario 3 MoneyCorp sells 90,000 shares for more than the current price, 2 each, because theres a lot of hype about its business. MoneyCorp now owns 190,000 in 100,000 shares and each share is worth 1.90. Existing shareholders win big! This is why a company would like to make its share offering at the highest price possible think, Facebook IPO. Of course, the new shareholders may be disappointed. MoneyCorp is actually a lot like a real business! Actually, if you want to get down to it, MoneyCorp works very much like a moneymarket fund. The main difference between MoneyCorp and a random company on the stock market is that we know exactly how much money MoneyCorp is worth. You dont know that with a real business sales may grow, sales may drop, input prices may rise and fall, and theres room for disagreement  thats why stock markets are as unpredictable as they are, so theres room for doubt when a company sells their stock at a price existing shareholders think is too cheap or buys it at a price that is too expensive. Most companies raising capital will end up doing something close to scenario 1, the fairpricesforeveryone scenario. Legally, if you own part of a company and they do something a Scenario2 on you... you may be out of luck. Consider also the other owners are probably hurt as much as you are. Only the new shareholders win. And unless the management approving the deal is somehow giving themselves a sweetheart deal, itll be hard to demonstrate any malfeasance. As an individual, you probably wont file a lawsuit either, unless you own a very large stake in the company. Lawsuits are expensive. A big institutional investor or activist investor of some sort may file a suit if millions of dollars are at stake, but itll be ugly at best. If theres nothing evil going on with the management, this is just one way that a company loses money from bad management. Its probably not the most important one to worry about."

    "body": "You just disclosed that you are new investor to the stock market. Id advise that you first understand investing a bit better, as most will advise that investors need to be above a certain level before picking individual stocks. That said, most stocks trade in high enough volume and have low enough short interest that they dont fall under the category you seek. You want to first ask your broker if they have such a process, not all do. If so, they would need to provide you with the stocks that fall into this odd situation, specifically, the shares that have traders seeking to short the stock, but the stock is unavailable. Even then, the broker may have requirements that you dont fall into, minimum history with broker, minimum size account, etc. Worse, they are not likely to offer this for 100 shares, but may have a 1000 or higher share requirement. Are you willing to buy some obscure 50sh priced stock to lend out at 1mo? The guy trying to short it is far smarter than both you and I, at least regarding this particular stock.

For example, many people deposit money in a bank checking account. They dont get any interest or other profit from this, they just do it because the bank is a convenient place to store their money. The bank then loans some percentage of this money out and keeps the interest. I dont doubt that people have come up with more clever ways to use other peoples money.

That is, social security tax is 12.4 of your income. If youre a 1099, you pay the full 12.4. If youre W2, you pay 6.2 and the employer pays 6.2. So if they offer you the same nominal rate of pay, youre 6.2 better off with the W2. What sort of insurance could you get privately and what would it cost you? I have no idea what the going rates for insurance are in California. If youre all in generally good health, you might want to consider a highdeductible policy. Then if no one gets seriously sick youve saved a bunch of money on premiums. If someone does get sick you might still pay less paying the deductible than you would have paid on higher premiums. I wont go into further details as thats getting off into another question. Even if the benefits are poor, if there are any benefits at all it can be better than nothing. The only advantage I see to going with a 1099 is that if you are legally an independent contractor, then all your business expenses are deductible, while if you are an employee, there are sharp limits on deducting employee business expenses. Maybe others can think of other advantages. If there is some reason to go the 1099 route, I understand that setting up an LLC is not that hard. Ive never done it, but I briefly looked into it once and it appeared to basically be a matter of filling out a form and paying a modest fee."

    "body": "I answered a similar question before. Essentially, you shouldnt trust a site you find on the Internet merely because it looks professional and real. Before signing up with any new service provider you found online, you should verify the authenticity of both the organization itself and their web site address. Even if the name displayed by a web site represents a legitimate brokerage firm, any site you happen to come across on the Internet could be an elaborate spoof of a real company, intended to capture your personal details or worse. First, to check if a brokerage firm is in fact registered to trade securities  in the United States  you can consult FINRAs BrokerCheck online service. This might be the first of many checks you should undertake ... after you convince yourself that FINRA is legitimate. A metaproblem  Then, if you want to know if the web site address is authentic, one way is to contact that broker offline using the contact information found from a trusted source, such as the FINRA BrokerCheck details. Unfortunately, those details do not currently appear to contain the brokers web site URL. Else, that could be useful. Another thing to look at is the sites login or signup page, for a valid SSL certificate that is both issued to the correct legal name of the brokerage firm as well as has been signed by a wellknown certificate authority e.g. VeriSign. For a financial services firm of any kind, you should look for and expect to see an Extended Validation Certificate. Any other kind of certificate might only assert that the certificate was issued to the domainname owner, and not necessarily to an organization with the registered legal name. Yes, anybody can register a domain with a similar name and then acquire a basic SSL certificate for that domain. FWIW, Scottrade and ShareBuilder are both legitimate brokers I was aware already of each, but I also just checked in the FINRA tool, and the URLs currently linked to by the question are legitimate web site addresses for each. Also, you can see their EV certificates in action on secured pages here and here. As to whether your investments with those brokers would be \"safe\" in the event of the broker failing e.g. goes bankrupt, youll want to know that they are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation Wikipedia. Of course, this kind of protection doesnt protect you if your investments simply go down in value. But do your own due diligence  always."

However 20 has an impact that I consider to be far more important than your monthly payment, and that is in your equity. If the DC market tanks, which I know it has not really done like much of the country but none of us have crystal balls to know if it will or not, then you will be more easily underwater the less you put down. Conversely putting 20 or more down makes you an easy sell to lenders [i]and[i] means that you dont have to worry nearly so much about having to do a short sale in the future. I would never buy a house with less than 20 down personally and have lived well below my means to get there, but I am not you. With regards to mortgages, the cheapskate way that I found information that I needed was to get books from the library that explained the mortgage process to me. When it came time to select an actual broker I used my realtors recommendation because I trusted my realtor to actually have my interests at heart because he was an old family friend  you cant usually do that so I dont recommend it and that of others I knew who had bought recently. I compared four lenders and competed them against each other to get the best terms. They will give you estimate sheets that help you weigh not only rates but costs of different fees such as the origination fee and discount points. Make sure to know what fees the lender controls and what fees she doesnt so that you know which lines to actually compare. Beyond a lender make sure that before closing you have found a title company that you think is a good choice your realtor or lender will try to pick one for you because thats the way the business is played but it is a racket  pick one who will give you the best deal on title, a settlment company may be title company, lender, or other that wont charge you an excessive amount, a survey company that you like if required in DC for your title insurance, and homeowners insurance coverage that you think is a good deal. The time between contract and closing is short and nobody tells you to research all the closing costs that on a 500,000 place run to in excess of 10,000, but you should. Also know that your closing costs will be about 2 of the purchase price and plan accordingly. In general take some time to educate yourself on homebuying as well as neighborhoods and price ranges.

Back in 2011, my wife was struck and killed in a traffic incident. I had to immediately not in 2  3 days cover 50 of the entire costs of the funeral. The balance was due shortly after, though I now forget if the balance was due in 7 days or in 30. I suspect the latter. The life insurance paid out in approximately 4 months for this simple case. Even if your mortgage is insured, you still have to pay the entire balance, along with living expenses, until the paperwork is resolved. And, again in simple cases, assume this will take months rather than days or weeks. My point is, the funeral is only one of the expenses youll have to cover in such a situation, though generally youll have sufficient lead time for the other expenses, where your investments would likely be sufficiently liquid. Yes, a credit card would and did help in this situation, but if you have no credit card as your question poses, you need ready access to thousands of dollars to cover this sort of eventuality. My bank told me that many people in such a situation have to take out an emergency loan the very day their spouse dies. Let me assure you this would be... emotionally difficult. Funerals vary widely in price. The Motley Fool indicates the median cost of a funeral with a vault was 8,343 in 2014. Crematory fees, a headstone, flowers, food, obituaries, all add to this cost. My total cost was closer to three times the median, though some of the expenses headstone, primarily came later. Im sure I could have gone for a cheaper funeral, though its hard to make rational economic decisions at that sort of time. I dont recall the exact amount I had to put down, but it was somewhere around 6000  8000.

    "header": "How should I calculate the opportunity cost of using a 401k loan?",
    "body": "One way to analyze the opportunity cost of using a 401K loan would be to calculate your net worth after using a 401K loan. If your net worth increases then the 401K loan would be advisable. Note that the calculations provided below do not take into account tax considerations. A net worth calculation is where you add all your assets and then subtract all your liabilities. The resulting number is your net worth. First, calculate the net worth of not taking the loan and simply paying the credit card interest. This means you only pay the interest on the credit card. In addition to the parameters identified in your question, two additional parameters will need to be considered Cash and the market rate of return on the 401K. Scenario 1 only pay credit card interest After 12 months all you have paid is the interest on the credit card. The 401K balance is untouched so it will hopefully grow. The balance on the credit card remains at the end of 12 months. Scenario 2 use 401K loan to pay credit card balance You borrow 5,000 from your 401K to pay the credit card balance. You will have to pay 5,000 plus the 401K interest rate back into your 401K account. Use the following equation to determine when Scenario 2 increases your net worth more than scenario 1 Thus, if your credit card interest rate is greater than the rate you can earn on your 401K then use the 401K loan to pay off the credit card balance. Another scenario that should be considered borrow money from somewhere else to pay off the credit card balance. Scenario 3 external loan to pay credit card balance You borrow 5,000 from somewhere besides your 401K to pay off the credit card balance. The following is used to determine if you should use an external loan over the 401K loan This means you should use an external loan if you can obtain an interest rate less than the rate of return you can earn on your 401K. The same methodology can be used to compare Scenario 3 to Scenario 1."

    "body": "Yes on taxes. It depends on the other point. As you already see from Bens comment, if youre both very Western in your culture, you may want to consider Bens advice because while you will save money, it may not be considered a healthy way to start a relationship. Western culture tends to see marriage as more of a \"do it for love\" whereas other cultures may view marriage more pragmatically and take economics and finance as a major consideration. For instance, a friend of mine married his spouse and it was 100 pragmatic  considering taxes and laws, driving most of his family insane because \"it doesnt sound very loving\" these were the exact words. Unfortunately, this created tension later on because family on both sides kept telling both of them that the other didnt love the partner and they used how their marriage started as proof. As surprising as it is to me nonWestern, many Americans are horrified at people marrying at the JOP or other pragmatic ways, even if it saves them thousands. Answering questions about relationships is very difficult because often the issue is less about money and more about culture. If youre both from pragmatic cultures where economics and finance weigh strongly and you dont see possible issues with family and really be honest on this point, then consider the financial advantages."

To your question about debt consolidation companies, as far as I know, thats all they do. However, longterm, theres only two ways to stay on top of debt increase your income, or reduce your spending. Basically, if you cant or wont get a raise or a job that pays more or a second job, you need to cut back on your spending. You might need to do something radical, like move somewhere with cheaper rent as long as increased travel costs doesnt offset the saving.

You could theoretically max out the SIMPLE IRA 11,500 and then contribute 4,000 to your 401k, but your total cant exceed the 401k limit of 16,500. This also means you could max out your 401k at 16,500, but you couldnt contribute anything to the SIMPLE IRA. Note that no matter what, you cant contribute more than 11,500 to your SIMPLE IRA. Note that this is all independent from your Traditional or Roth IRA, which are subject to their own limits, and not affected by your participation in employersponsored plans. As I understand it, a 401k and a SIMPLE IRA both fall under the umbrella of \"employersponsored plans\". Just like you cant max out two 401ks at two different employers, you cant do it with the 401k and the SIMPLE IRA. The only weird thing is the contribution limit differences between SIMPLE IRA and 401k, but I dont think the IRS couldwould penalize you for working two jobs enforcing the lower SIMPLE IRA limit for all employersponsored retirement accounts. You should probably run the numbers, factoring in the employer match, and figure out which accountcontribution scenario makes the most financial sense for you. However, Im not sure how the employer match helps you when youre talking about a small business that you ownrun. You may also want to look at how the employer match of the SIMPLE IRA affects the taxes your business pays. Disclaimer 1 I couldnt find a definitive answer on your specific scenario at irs.gov.

Your question suggests that you rightly observed that it was not a good idea around 2006 the last peak in housing. That was when prices were at their maximum, and had nowhere to go but down. Some experts think that house prices STILL have further to go on the downside. Meanwhile, wages have been going nowhere during that time. This phenomenon seems to happen about every 40 years or so, the 1930s, the 1970s, and around 2010. At MOST other times, say the 1980s, houses are likely to go up for the \"foreseeable\" future. At those times, you want to buy the house at \"todays\" price, then pay for it in future dollars when you are earning more money. The irony is that what most people observe as teenagers is usually the wrong thing to do when they are, say, forty. In 2035, it will probably make sense to have a large mortgage in a bull housing market, which is the opposite of what you observed around 2010. So a better rule is to do at age 40 what made sense about the time you were born in your case, perhaps the 1990s. Whereas the people born in the early 1970s that got \"caught\" recently, observed the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s in THEIR teens and twenties, rather than the bear market of the 1970s that took place about the time they were born."

    "body": "A lot of loans are taken out on a fixed rate basis, so the rate is part of the contract and is therefore covered by contract law. If the loan is taken out on a variable basis then in principle the rate can rise within the terms of the contract. If a particular lender tries to raise its rates out of line with the market then its customers will seek alternative, cheaper, loans and pay off their expensive loan if they can. If rates rise sharply in general due to unusual politicoeconomic circumstances then those with variable rate loans can find themselves in severe trouble. For example the base rate in the UK and therefore variable mortgage rates closely tied to it spiked sharply in the late 80s which caused severe stress to a lot of borrowers and undoubtedly pushed some into financial difficulties."

Typically a fund has dividend income from its holdings, and it deducts the expenses from the that income, and only the net dividend is passed through to the ETF holder. In the case of QQQ, it certainly will have dividend income as it approximates a large stock index. The prospectus shows that it will adjust daily the reported Net Asset Value NAV to reflect accrued expenses, and the cash to pay them will come from the dividend cash. If the dividend does not cover the expenses, the NAV will decline away from the modeled index. Note that the NAV is not the ETF price found on the exchange, but is the underlying value. The price tends to track the NAV fairly closely, both because investors dont want to overpay for an ETF or get less than it is worth, and also because large institutions may buy or redeem a large block of shares to profit when the price is out of line. This will bring the price closer to that of the underlying asset e.g. the NASDAQ 100 for QQQ which is reflected by the NAV."

If you bought 1 share at that time, you would now have 48 shares today. Yahoo is showing a price of 66 for what was then 1 share. 6648  1.375, which Google rounds to 1.38. You can see this if you get the prices from May 1421, 1981. The stock split 3for1, and the price dropped from 108 to 36.38. Yahoos adjusted close column has not been accurate since they rewrote the Finance website. It now just represents the closing price. The other relevant field on Yahoo is the Adj. Close.

So banks may be able to acquire the same net interest margin with lower risk. However the article also mentions new research from a federal agency Their findings show that net interest margins NIMs get worse during lowrate environments, defined as any time when a countrys threemonth sovereign bond yield is less than 1.25.

    "body": "I think your premise is slightly flawed. Every investment can add or reduce risk, depending on how its used. If your ordering above is intended to represent the probability you will lose your principal, then its roughly right, with caveats. If you buy a longterm government bond and interest rates increase while youre holding it, its value will decrease on the secondary markets. If you needwant to sell it before maturity, you may not recover your principal, and if you hold it, you will probably be subject to erosion of value due to inflation inflation and interest rates are correlated. Over the shortterm, the stock market can be very volatile, and you can suffer large paper losses. But over the longterm decades, the stock market has beaten inflation. But this is true in aggregate, so, if you want to decrease equity risk, you need to invest in a very diversified portfolio index mutual funds and hold the portfolio for a long time. With a strategy like this, the stock market is not that risky over time. Derivatives, if used for their original purpose, can actually reduce volatility and therefore risk by reducing both the upside and downside of your other investments. For example, if you sell covered calls on your equity investments, you get an income stream as long as the underlying equities have a value that stays below the strike price. The cost to you is that you are forced to sell the equity at the strike price if its value increases above that. The person on the other side of that transaction loses the price of the call if the equity price doesnt go up, but gets a benefit if it does. In the commodity markets, Southwest Airlines used derivatives options to buy at a fixed price in the future on fuel to hedge against increases in fuel prices for years. This way, they added predictability to their cost structure and were able to beat the competition when fuel prices rose. Even had fuel prices dropped to zero, their exposure was limited to the prenegotiated price of the fuel, which theyd already planned for. On the other hand, if you start doing things like selling uncovered calls, you expose yourself to potentially infinite losses, since there are no caps on how high the price of a stock can go. So its not possible to say that derivatives as a class of investment are risky per se, because they can be used to reduce risk. I would take hedge funds, as a class, out of your list. You cant generally invest in those unless you have quite a lot of money, and they use strategies that vary widely, many of which are quite risky."

If you have shares that you are interested in selling, then the bid is what you could immediately sell a share for. If you sell a share for 100, that means someone was willing to pay you 100 for it. If after buying it, they still want to buy more for 100 each, or someone else does, then the bid is still 100, and you havent changed the price. If no one else is willing to pay more than 90 for a share, then the price would drop to 90 next time a transaction takes place and thats what you would be able to immediately sell the next share for."

When the stocks are purchased, I would sell them immediately, not hold. This way you have 10 premium as your income pretty much guaranteed, unless the stock falls significantly on the very same day, and almost no exposure. This sums up to be a nice 1.5 yearly guaranteed bonus, on top of any other compensation. As to keeping the stocks, this depends on how much you believe in your company and expect the stocks to appreciate. Being employed and dependent on the company with your salary, Id avoid investing in your company, as youre invested in it deeply as it is."

This is how we find this information. Our types of companies spend significant time, money and resources in finding out about the money, then finding who it actually belongs to because it does not always belong to who is mentioned on the list and then finding the correct individual.  jdsweet I apologize if you think this is a marketing ploy. It is not. Our company doesnt even take phone calls from people that want us to find them money. Only if we contact someone, because at that time were confident that the person we touch base with is due the funds. Again, I am not plugging our company, but trying to let Neil know that in some cases he is right, you dont need a third party to claim funds for you  if you can find them. In this case, he has looked and cannot find them. Keane is charging a fair amount to retrieve funds he cannot find and doesnt know about and is not charging him anything to do all the work. Again, as mentioned above, the direct answer is that we know how to access information and lists that have this money hidden from the public because the agency holding the funds doesnt want you to know about it so that they can escheat the funds. Escheating is the states legal way to confiscate your money. See, if you dont put in a claim for the money depending on what type it is and where it is located the agency and state holding the funds has certain time frames for you to get the money. If you dont, again, they get to keep it and that is what they want despite what they say. That is why there is approximately 33 Billion that is known to the public and really 1 Trillion thats out there. I apologize if you think that this is a plug for my company, its not because were not looking for calls, we make them. Im also not asking Neil for his business.

Also, will you be able to add to that amount on a regular basis going forward? If you are just looking for a way to get 100 into the stock market, your best option may be DRIP investing. DRIP stands for Dividend ReInvestment Plan. The idea is that you buy shares in a company typically directly from the company and then the money from the dividends are automatically used to buy additional fractional shares. Most DRIP plans also allow you to invest additional on a monthly basis even fractional shares. The advantages of this approach for you is that many DRIP plans have small upfront requirements. I just looked up Cocacolas and they have a 500 minimum, but they will reduce the requirement to 50 if you continue investing 50month. The fees for DRIP plans also generally fairly small which is going to be important to you as if you take a traditional broker approach too large a percentage of your money will be going to commissions. Other stock DRIP plans may have lower monthly requirements, but dont make your decision on which stock to buy based on who has the lowest minimum you only want a stock that is going to grow in value. They primary disadvantages of this approach is that you will be investing in a only a single stock I dont believe that can get started with a mutual fund or ETF with 100, you will be fairly committed to that stock, and you will be taking a long term investing approach. The Motley Fool investing website also has some information on DRIP plans  httpwww.fool.comDRIPPortHowToInvestDRIPs.htm . Its a fairly old article, but I imagine that many of the links still work and the principles still apply If you are looking for a more medium term or balanced investment, I would advise just opening an online savings account. If you can grow that to 500 or 1,000 you will have more options available to you. Even though savings accounts dont pay significant interest right now, they can still help you grow your money by helping you segregate your money and make regular deposits into savings."

Possibly this is no longer true today, but for quite a while it was a significant selling point of the Discover card to merchants, and a reason why many did sign on.

If India wants to buy an F16s, at cost 34M USD, theyll have to actually acquire 34M USD, or else convince the seller to agree to a different currency.

One of which is to exchange INR India Rupees at whatever the current exchange rate is, to whomever will agree to the opposite  i.e., someone who has USD and wants INR, or at least is willing to be the middleman. Another would be to sell some goods or services in the US for USD, or to someone else for USD. Indian companies undoubtedly do this all the time. Think of all of those H1B workers that are in the news right now theyre all earning USD and then converting those to INRs. So the Indian government can just buy their USD for INR, directly or more likely indirectly through a currency exchange market. A third method would be to use some of their currency stores. Most countries have significant reserves of various foreign currencies on hand, for two reasons one to simplify transactions like this one, and also to stabilize the value of their own currency. A less stable currency can be stabilized simply by the central bank of that country owning USD, EUR, Pounds Sterling, or similar stablevalue currencies. The process for an individual would be essentially the same, though the third method would be less likely available most individuals dont have millions in cash on hand from different currencies  although certainly some would. No government gets involved except for taxes or whatnot, its just a matter of buying USD in exchange for INRs or for goods or services."

Yes, you can be denied even if you have money for a down payment. One of the BIGGEST factors lenders are now required to take into account when approving mortgages now is a persons Ability to Repay. Whether your traditional mortgages like Conventional, FHA, USDA, or VA loans, or even an inhouse mortgage from a local bank either way, the lender MUST be able to verify someones ability to repay. Your issue is that you wont have any verifiable income until May. A couple people have answered correctly in that 1 if you have a firm offer letter that can be verified with the employer, and 2 you can use your educationcollege to substitute for a two year work history as long as youre graduating with and working in the same line of work. Some programs require proof of 30 days of pay history once you actually start earning paychecks some programs will use the offer letter as long as you will start earning paychecks within a certain number of days after the note date basically when the payments start. Also Im making the assumption that there is some sort of credit history that can be verified. Most lenders want at least a couple of accounts reporting a history just to show good use of credit and showing that you can manage your finances over a longer period of time. Just about every lender has some sort of minimum FICO score requirement. I hope this helps. If you have questions, just reply in a comment."

    "header": "What determines price fluctuation of groceries",
    "body": "Yes and no. First off, commodity prices reflect the cost of a good about 3 steps back in the retail supply chain the agreedupon price for the raw foodstuff between farmersranchers and manufacturers. Your grocer may carry bags of whole grain wheat, but thats certainly not all he carries that contains it. Same for corn, rice and other staple grains, as well as for fruits and vegetables, herbs yes, you can buy basil by the ton on the CME, meats, various sugars, etc. So, a longterm sustained change in prices of a commodity foodstuff will eventually affect the real cost to you to buy things theyre made from. However, in the short term, the retail supply chain will generally act as a buffer between these prices and the ones you see on the store shelf. Consumers dont like price increases, especially of necessities like food. When food costs go up, consumers can and will very quickly change their spending habits, buying cheaper options to get their needed calories. That makes manufacturers nervous consumers not buying their product is a worse scenario than consumers buying their product at a reduced gain or even at a loss. So, manufacturers, and suppliers and retailers, will all absorb as much as they can of the cost of a commodities increase before beginning to pass it on to consumers. On the flip side, while consumers like price drops, they dont notice them as much as price increases. So, the supply chain will also absorb a fall in commodity prices by resisting price reductions in the consumer goods, as long as they can get away with it which is usually longer than the price reduction actually lasts. The net effect is that processed food prices typically follow the gentle upward climb of longterm inflation, and only rarely do you see drastic price increases or decreases. Where this model breaks down a little bit is in highly perishable foodstuffs, especially seasonal or \"wildmanaged\" foods fruits and vegetables, seafood, etc. The limited time in which the stuff can be sold makes the process of getting a fish out of the ocean and a fruit off the tree and into your grocery store much more marketdriven the producers, suppliers and grocers are all in constant contact over whats available and how much they can get for what price. The prices therefore are typically a lower markup unlike highly processed grainbased foods, theres not much added value to be marked up between the apple farmer picking the fruit and the grocer putting it on display, but also much more volatile if theres a bumper crop of fruit, the farmer has to unload it all or it goes to waste, while similarly if an early freeze decimated the apple crop, the suppliers cant just get some of last years bumper crop out of storage they fight with everyone else for what little made it to market. Farmers will sometimes intentionally let excess crop spoil in order to maintain a minimum price for what they sell the rest can at least be composted and used for fertilizer, saving them some money on maintenance, but theres no silver bullet for a shortage. This is why a lot of these foods, especially seafood, are considered luxury items theyre not stable enough for everyone to get as much as they want whenever they want, unlike staple grains."

What if you are by then too used to the high life to give it up, and end up under mountains of debt?

    "body": "Yes it is possible, as long as the broker you use allows conditional orders. I use CMC Markets in Australia, and they allow free conditional orders either when initially placing a buy order or after already buying a stock. See the Place New Order box below Once you have selected a stock to buy, the number of shares you want to buy and at what price you can place up to 3 conditional orders. The first condition is a \"Place order if...\" conditional order. Here you can place a condition that your buy order will only be placed onto the market if that condition is met first. Say the stock last traded at 9.80 and you only want to place your order the next day if the stock price moves above the current resistance at 10.00. So you would Place order if Price is at or above 10.00. So if the next day the price moves up to 10 or above your order will be placed onto the market. The second condition is a \"Stop loss\" conditional order. Here you place the price you want to sell at if the price drops to or past your stop loss price. It will only be placed on to the market if your buy order gets traded. So if you wanted to place your stop loss at 9.00, you would type in 9.00 in the box after \"If at or below ?\" and select if you want a limit or market order. The third condition is a \"Take profit\" conditional order. This allows you to take profits if the stock reaches a certain price. Say you wanted to take profits at 50, that is if the price reached 15.00. So you would type in 15.00 in the box after \"If at or above ?\" and again select if you want a limit or market order. These conditional orders can all be placed at the time you enter your buy order and can be edited or deleted at any time. The broker you use may have a different process for entering conditional orders, and some brokers may have many more conditional orders than these three, so investigate what is out there and if you are confused in how to use the orders with your broker, simply ask them for a demonstration in how to use them."

The concept is fairly simple as is the math, buying great companies trading at discounts to what they are worth due to market fluctuations, emotionality, or overreactions to key sectors etc. If I buy ABC corp at 10 knowing it is worth 20, it could go down or trade sideways for FIVE YEARS doing seemingly nothing and then one day catch up with its worth due to any number of factors. In that case, my 100 return which took five years to actualize accounts for an average 20 return per year. Also and this should be obvious, but diversification is a double edged sword. Every year, hundreds of stocks individually beat the market return. Owning any one of these stocks as your only holding would mean that YOU beat the market. As you buy more stocks and diversify your return will get closer and closer to that of an index or mutual fund. My advice is to stick to fundamentals like value and GARP investing, learn to separate when the market is being silly from when it is responding to a genuine concern, do your own homework and analysis on the stocks you buy, BE PATIENT after buying stock that your analysis gives you confidence in, and dont over diversify.

Heres an example. 2014 Im ready to buy. My 3yearold tradein originally cost 15,000, and I financed it for 6 years and still owe 6500. It has lots of miles and excess wear, so fair bluebook is 4500. Im \"upside down\" by 2000, meaning Id have to pay 2000 cash just to walk away from the car. Ill never have that, because Im not a saver. So how can we get you in a new car today? Dealer says \"If you pay the full 15,000 retail price plus 1000 of worthless dealer addons like wax undercoat instead of the common discounted 14,000 price, Ill eat your 2000 loss on the trade.\" All gets folded into my new car financing. Its magic! actually its called rollover. 2017 Im getting itchy to trade up, and doggone it, Im upside down on this car. Why does this keep happening to me?

    "body": "One of the main tax loopholes more readily available to the wealthy in the U.S. is the fact that longterm capital gains are taxed at a much lower rate. Certainly, people making less than 250,000year can take advantage of this as well, but the fact is that people making, say, 60,000year likely have a much smaller proportion of their income available to invest in, say, indexed mutual funds or ETFs. You may wish to read Wikipedias article on capital gains tax in the United States. You can certainly make the argument that the preferential tax rate on capital gains is appropriate, and the Wikipedia article points out a number of these. Nevertheless, this is one of the main mechanisms whereby people with higher wealth in the U.S. typically leverage the tax code to their advantage."

The adjusted close will include these changes where the straight close will not include them. Using the adjusted close you will get your true percentage change. For example I have a stock called PETS that paid an 0.18 dividend in July 2015. The adjusted closes before that day in July are all 0.18 lower per share. Say the closing price had been unchanged at 20.00. The close prices would say I made no profit, but the adjusted closing price would say I made 0.18 per share on this investment because the adjusted close would read 19.82 in June 2015 but would read 20.00 in August 2015 just like the closing price. The adjusted close allows me to know my true profit per share."

    "body": "You can calculate your exposure intuitively, by calculating your fx sensitivity. Take your total USD assets, lets assume 50k. Convert to EUR at the current rate, lets assume 1 EUR  1.1 USD, resulting in 45.5k EUR . If the USD strengthens by 1, this moves to a rate of 1.09, resulting in 46k EUR value for the same 50k of USD investments. From this you can see that for every 1 the USD strengthens, you gain 500 EUR. For every 1 the USD weakens, you lose 500 EUR. The simplest way to reduce your exchange rate risk exposure, is to simply eliminate your foreign currency investments. ie if you do not want to be exposed to fluctuations in the USD, invest in EUR only. This will align your assets with the currency of your future expenses [assuming you intend to continue living in Europe].This is not possible of course, if you would like to maintain investments in US assets. One relatively simple method available to invest in the US, without gaining an exposure to the USD, is to invest in USD assets only with money borrowed in USD. ie if you borrow 50k USD, and invest 50k in the US stock market, then your new investments will be in the same currency as your debt. Therefore if the USD strengthens, your assets increase in relative EUR value, and your debt becomes more expensive. These two impacts wash out, leaving you with no net exposure to the value of the USD. There is a risk to this option  you are investing with a higher financial leverage ratio. Using borrowed money to invest increases your risk if your investments fall in value, you still need to make the periodic interest payments. Many people view this increased risk as a reason to never invest with borrowed money. You are compensated for that risk, by increased returns [because you have the ability to earn investment income without contributing any additional money of your own]. Whether the risk is worth it to you will depend on many factors  you should search this site and others on the topic to learn more about what those risks mean."

Dividends are paid periodically the yield is calculated based on the stock price when the dividend is declared usually, though some services may update this more frequently. I like to calculate my own dividend by annualizing the dividend payment divided by my cost basis per share. As an example, say you have shares in X, Co. X issues a quarterly dividend of 1 per share and the share price is 100 coincidentally this is the price at which you purchased your shares. But a few years goes by and now X issues its quarterly dividend of 1.50 per share, and the share price is 160. However your shares only cost you 100. Your annual yield on X is 6, not the published 3.75. All of this is to say that looking back on dividend yields is somewhat similar to nailing jello to the wall. Do you look at actual dividends paid through the year divided by share price? Do you look at the annualized dividend at the time of issue then average those? The stock price will fluctuate, that will change the yield depending on where you bought your stock, your actual yield will vary from the published amount as well."

If the stock market is very unfamiliar for you, I recommend Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, and Zacks to learn about smart investments you can make. You can also research the investments that hedge fund managers and top investors are making. Google \"Warren Buffett or Carl Icahn portfolio\", and this will give you an idea of stocks you can put your money into. Do not leave your money into a certain company for more than 25 years. Rebalance your portfolio and take the gains when you feel you need them. You have no idea when to take your profits now, but 5 years from now, you will be a smart and experienced investor. A safe investment strategy to start is to put your money into an ETF that mimics the SP 500. Over the past 20 years, the SP 500 has yielded gains of about 270. During the financial crisis a few years back, the SP 500 had lost over 50 of its value when it reached its low point. However, from when it hit rock bottom in 2009, it has had as high percentage gains in six years as it did in 12 years from 1995 to 2007, which about 200. The market is very strong and will treat your money well if you invest wisely. 500 Medium  High risk Speculative Stocks There is a reason this category accounts for only approximately 3 of your portfolio. This may take some research on the weekend, but the returns that may result can be extraordinary. Speculative companies are often innovative, low priced stocks that see high volatility, gains or losses of more than 10 over a single month. The likelihood of your 500 investment being completely evaporated is very slim, but if you lose 300 here, the thousands invested in the SP 500, low risk stocks, government bonds, and mutual funds will more than recuperate the losses. If your pick is a winner, however, expect that the 500 investment could easily double, triple, or gain even more in a single year or over the course of just a few, perhaps, 24 years will see a very large return. I hope this advice helps and happy investing! Sending your money to smart investments is the key to financial security, freedom, and later, a comfortable retirement. Good luck, Matt McLaughlin"

There are those who suggest that one should assume a rule of thumb here that you should assume expenses of half the rent. 6 per year in this case. With a mortgage cost of 4.5 on a rental, you have a forecast profit of 1.5yr. thats 4500 on a 300K house. If you buy 20 of these, youll have a decent income, and a frequently ringing phone. Theres no free lunch, rental property can be a full time business. And very lucrative, but its rarely a slam dunk. In response to OPs comment  First, while I do claim to know finance fairly well, I dont consider myself at expert level when it comes to real estate. In the US, the ratio varies quite a bit from area to area. The 1 rent you observe may turn out to be great. Actual repair costs low, long term tenants, rising home prices, etc. Improve the 1.5yr to 2 on the 20 down, and you have a 10 return, ignoring appreciation and principal paydown. And this example of leverage is how investors seem to get such high returns. The flip side is bad luck with tenants. An eviction can mean no rent for a few months, and damage that needs fixing. A house has a number of long term replacement costs that good numbers often ignore. Roof, exterior painting, all appliances, heat, AC, etc. Thats how that \"50 of rent to costs\" rule comes into play."

The real rate of a return on the market subtracting inflation and taxes is going to be somewhere around 56. So by this math, youd be best off paying the minimum to get out of PMI, and then investing the remainder in a low fee index fund. The question becomes how much that 12 is worth to you vs how much the job flexibility is worth. It boils down to your personal risk preference, life conditions, etc. so it is difficult to give good advice. The 12 difference in your rate of return is not going to be catastrophic. Personally, I would run the numbers with your fiance. Build a spreadsheet tracking your estimated net worth under the assumption that you make a 20 down payment and invest the rest. Then hold all other factors equal, and rebuild the spreadsheet with the higher down payment. Factor in one of you losing your job for a few years, or one of you taking off for a while to raise the kids. You can make a judgement call based how the two of you feel about those numbers."

The lender is free to say no, and if they think the other person is unlikely to pay it back, they wont refinance. If youre in this situation because the other person didnt qualify for a loan in the first place, the lender probably wont change their mind, but its still worth asking. From the lenders point of view, youll be selling the other person the car. If they qualify for a loan, its as simple as getting the loan from a bank, then doing whatever is required by your state to sell a car between either private parties or between relatives depending on who the other person is. The bank might help you with this, or your states DMV website. Here are a few options that dont involve changing who is on the loan Taking out a loan for another person is always a big risk. Banks have entire departments devoted to determining who is a good credit risk, and who isnt, so if a person cant get a loan from a bank, its usually for a good reason. One good thing about your situation you actually bought the car, and are the listed owner.

    "body": "Basically, a 401k can have what is called a \"loan\", but is more properly a \"structured withdrawal and repayment agreement\". This allows you to access your nest egg to pay for unforeseen expenses, without having to actually cash it out and pay the 10 penalty plus taxes. You can get up to half of your current savings, with an absolute cap of 50k, minus the balance of any other loan outstanding. While there is a balance outstanding, you must make regular scheduled payments. The agreement does include an interest rate, but basically that interest money goes into your account. The downside of a 401k loan is the inflexibility you must pay the scheduled amount, and you also have to keep the job for which youre paying into the 401k if you quit or are fired, the balance of the loan must usually be paid in 60 days, or else the financial institution will consider the unpaid balance a \"withdrawal\" and notify the IRS to that effect. Now, with a Roth account, it works a little differently. Basically, contributions to any Roth account IRA or 401k are posttax. But, that means the moneys now yours there is no penalty or additional taxes levied on any amount you cash out. So, a loan basically just provides structure you withdraw, then pay back under structured terms.

Longterm gains including those distributed by a mutual fund or other RIC, and also qualified dividends, both not relevant here are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income but are still bracketed almost not quite like ordinary income, not always 15. Specifically if your ordinary taxable income after deductions and exemptions, equivalent to line 43 minus LTCGQD ends in the 25 to 33 brackets, your LTCGQD income is taxed at 15 unless the total of ordinarypreferred reaches the top of those brackets, then any remainder at 20. These brackets depend on your filing status and are adjusted yearly for inflation, for 2016 they are  single 37,650 to 413,350  marriedjoint or widower 75,300 to 413,350  headofhousehold 50,400 to 441,000 special  marriedseparate 37,650 to 206,675 which Id guess covers at least the middle three quintiles of the earningtaxpaying population. OTOH if your ordinary income ends below the 25 bracket, your LTCGQD income that fits in the lower brackets is taxed at 0 not at all and only the portion that would be in the ordinary 25andup brackets is taxed at 15. IF your ordinary taxable income this year was below those brackets, or you expect next year it will be possibly due to statusexemptiondeduction changes as well as income change, then if all else is equal you are better off realizing the stock gain in the years where some or more of it fits in the 0 bracket.

However, if you split the gain so that both 2016 and 2017 have income and thus taxes higher than normal for you, you will need to make estimated payments andor increase withholding for 2017.

Auto loans dont have the fees mortgages do, but check the specific loan youre looking at  it may have some fees, and theyd need to be lower than the interest rate savings. Car loans can be tricky to refinance, because of the value of a used car being less than that of a new car. How much better your credit is likely determines how hard this would be to get. Also, how much down payment you put down. Cars devalue 20 or so instantly a used car with 5 miles on it tends to be worth around 80 of a new cars cost, so if you put less than 20 down, you may be underwater  meaning the principal left on the loan exceeds the value of the car and so you wouldnt be getting a fully secured loan at that point. However, if your loan amount isnt too high relative to the value of the car, it should be possible. Check out various lenders in advance also check out nonlender sites for advice. Edmunds.com has some of this laid out, for example though theyre an industrybased site so theyre not truly unbiased. Id also recommend using this to help you pay off the loan faster. If you do refinance to a lower rate, consider taking the savings and sending it to the lender  i.e., keeping your payment the same, just lowering the interest charge. That way you pay it off faster."

Really the rest is details around those seven concepts. On his site there is a link to a free onehour podcast for the iPod, and you can pay for the full three hours of his radio show on podcast.

He views his system as an extension of his Christian beliefs. That sells very well in parts of the US, but doesnt port very well. There is actually nothing religious in his program, other than the occasional reference to biblical verses in an attempt to tie his program into his religion, but people who are really interested and want to teach his program, not just practice it, are going to find they need to be an Evangelical or at least a Christian to fit in.

First they look at profitability if you reported a net profit i.e. paid taxes in your first 3 years, they will believe you rant on Youtube for a living. Remember, by the time they get around to auditing you, youll likely be well into, or through, your third year. There is an exception for farms. Other than that, if you lose money year after year, you better be able to show that you look, walk and quack like a business and one with a reasonable business reason for delayed profitability. For instance Netflixs old business model of mailing DVDs had very high fixed infrastructure expense that took years to turn profitable, but was a very sensible model. Theyre fine with that. Pets.com swandived into oblivion but they earnestly tried. Theyre fine with that too. You cant mix all your activities. If youre an electrician specializing in IoT and smart homes, can you deduct a trip to the CES trade show, you bet. Blackhat conference, arguable. SES? No way. Now if you had a second business of a productreco site which profited by ads and affiliate links, then SES would be fine to deduct from that business. But if this second business loses money every year, its a hobby and not deductible at all. That person would want separate accounting books for the electrician and webmaster businesses. Thats a basic \"duck test\" of a business vs. a hobby. You need to be able to show how each business gets income and pays expense separate from every other business and your personal life. Its a bestpractice to give each business a separate checking account and checkbook. You dont need to risk tax penalties on a businesslarva that may never pupate. You can amend your taxes up to 3 years after the proper filing date.

    "body": "Will buying a flat which generates 250 rent per month be a good decision? Whether investing in real estate is a good decision or not depends on many things, including the current and future supplydemand for rental units in your particular area. There are many questions on this site about this topic, and another answer to this question which already addresses many risks associated with owning property though there are also benefits to consider. I just want to focus on this point you raised I personally think yes, because rent adjusts with inflation and the rise in the price of the property is another benefit. Could this help me become financially independent in the long run since inflation is getting adjusted in it? In my opinion, the fact that rental income general adjusts with inflation is a hedge against some types of economic risk, not an absolute increase in value. First, consider buying a house to live in, instead of to rent If you pay off your mortgage before your retire, then you have reduced your cost of accommodations to only utilities, property taxes, and repairs. This gives you a relatively known, fixed requirement of cash outflows. If the value of property goes up by the time you retire  it doesnt cost you anything extra, because you already own your house. If the value of property goes down by the time you retire, then you dont save anything, because you already own your house. If you instead rent your whole life, and save money each month instead of paying off a mortgage, then when you retire, you will have a larger amount of savings which you can use to pay your monthly rental costs each month. By the time you retire, your cost of accommodations will be the market price for rent at that time. If the value of property goes up by the time you retire  you will have to pay more on rent. If the value of property goes down by the time you retire, you will save money on rent. You will have larger savings, but your cash outflow will be a little bit less certain, because you dont know what the market price for rent will be. You can see that, because you need to put a roof over your own head, just by existing you bear risk of the cost of property rising. So, buying your own home can be a hedge against that risk. This is called a natural hedge, where two competing risks can mitigate eachother just by existing. This doesnt mean buying a house is always the right thing to do, it is just one piece of the puzzle to comparing the two alternatives [see many other threads on buying vs renting on this site, or on google]. Now, consider buying a house to rent out to other people In the extreme scenario, assume that you do everything you can to buy as much property as possible. Maybe by the time you retire, you own a small apartment building with 11 units, where you live in one of them as an example, and you have no other savings. Before, owning your own home was, among other pros and cons, a natural hedge against the risk of your own personal cost of accommodations going up. But now, the risk of your many rental units is far greater than the risk of your own personal accommodations. That is, if rent goes up by 100 after you retire, your rental income goes up by 1,000, and your personal cost of accommodations only goes up by 100. If rent goes down by 50 after you retire, your rental income goes down by 500, and your personal cost of accommodations only goes down by 50. You can see that only investing in rental properties puts you at great risk of fluctuations in the rental market. This risk is larger than if you simply bought your own home, because at least in that case, you are guaranteeing your cost of accommodations, which you know you will need to pay one way or another. This is why most investment advice suggests that you diversify your investment portfolio. That means buying some stocks, some bonds, etc.. If you invest to heavily in a single thing, then you bear huge risks for that particular market. In the case of property, each investment is so large that you are often undiversified if you invest heavily in it you cant just buy a house 100 at a time, like you could a stock or bond. Of course, my above examples are very simplified. I am only trying to suggest the underlying principle, not the full complexities of the real estate market. Note also that there are many types of investments which typically adjust with inflation  cost of living real estate is only one of them."

Just seems like you may be dealing with a company that has relatively light trading volume to begin with, meaning that small trades could easily make the price drop 8 which isnt much if youre talking about a stocks in the 5 or less range. If someone sells at the bid and the bid happens to be 8 lower than the current price, that bid is now the price, hence the drop. The bid moving up afterward, just means that someone is now willing to place a higher order than what the last trade was, to try to get in."

    "header": "Paying off mortgage or invest in annuity",
    "body": "There is no formula to answer the question. You have to balance return on investment with risk. Theres also the question of whether you have any children or other heirs that you would like to leave money to. The mortgage is presumably a guaranteed thing you know exactly how much the payments will be for the rest of the loan. I think most annuities have a fixed rate of return, but they terminate when you both die. There are annuities with a variable return, but usually with a guaranteed minimum. So if you got an annuity with a fixed 3.85 return, and you lived exactly 18 more years, then ignoring tax implications, thered be no practical difference between the two choices. If you lived longer than 18 years, the annuity would be better. If less, paying off the mortgage would be better. Another option to consider is doing neither, but keeping the money in the 401k or some other investment. This will usually give better than 3.85 return, and the principal will be available to leave to your heirs. The big drawback to this is risk investments in the stock market and the like usually do better than 3 or 4, but not always, and sometimes they lose money. Earlier I said \"ignoring tax implications\". Of course that can be a significant factor. Mortgages get special tax treatment, so the effective interest rate on a mortgage is less than the nominal rate. 401ks also get special tax treatment. So this complicates up calculations trying to compare. I cant give definitive numbers without knowing the returns you might get on an annuity and your tax situation."

    "header": "Is buying a home a good idea?",
    "body": "Buying a house may save you money compared with renting, depending on the area and specifics of the transaction including the purchase price, interest rates, comparable rent, etc.. In addition, buying a house may provide you with intangibles that fit your lifestyle goals permanence in a community, ability to renovate, pride of ownership, etc.. These factors have been discussed in other answers here and in other questions. However there is one other way I think potential home buyers should consider the financial impact of home ownership Buying a house provides you with a natural hedge against possible future changes in your cost of living. Assume the following If these two items are true, then buying a home allows you to guarantee today that your monthly living expenses will be mostly fixed, as long as you live in that community. In 2 years, if there is an explosion of new residents in your community and housing costs skyrocket  doesnt affect you, your mortgage payment [or if you paid cash, the lack of mortgage payment] is fixed. In 3 years, if there are 20 new apartment buildings built beside you and housing costs plummet  doesnt affect you, your mortgage payment is fixed. If you know that you want to live in a particular place 20 years from now, then buying a house in that area today may be a way of ensuring that you can afford to live there in the future. Remember that while your mortgage payment will be fixed, other costs of home ownership will be variable. See below. You may or may not save money compared with rent over the period you live in your house, but by putting your money into a house, you have protected yourself against catastrophic rent increases. What is the cost of hedging yourself against this risk? A The known costs of ownership [closing costs on purchase, mortgage interest, property tax, condo fees, home insurance, etc.] B The unknown costs of ownership [annual and periodic maintenance, closing costs on a future sale, etc.] C The potential earnings lost on your down payment  mortgage principal payments [whether it is lowrisk interest or higher risk equity] D You may have reduced savings for a long period of time which would limit your ability to cover emergencies such as medical costs, unexpected unemployment, etc. E You may have a reduced ability to look for a better job based on being locked into a particular location though I have assumed above that you want to live in a particular community for an extended period of time, that desire may change and F You cant reap the benefits of a rental market that decreases in real dollars, if that happens in your market over time. In short, purchasing a home should be a lifestylemotivated decision. It financially reduces some the fluctuation in your longterm living costs, with the tradeoff of committed principal dollars and additional ownership risks including limited mobility."

    "body": "Of course CDs are worth it compared to the stock market. In fact, most institutional investors are envious of the CDs you have access to as an individual investor that are unavailable to them. You just need to be competent enough to shop around for the best rates and understand your time horizon. There are several concepts to understand here Banks give out CDs with competitive rates projecting future interest rates. So while the Federal funds rate is currently extremely low, banks know that in order to get any takers on their CDs they have to factor in the public expectation that rates will rise, so if you lock in a longer term CD you get a competitive rate. Institutional investors do not have access to FDIC insured CDs and the closest analog they participate in are the auctions and secondary markets of US Treasuries. These two types of assets have equivalent default nonrisk if held to maturity backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Here are the current rates as of questions date taken from Vanguard that I can get on CDs versus Treasuries as an individual investor. Notice that CDs outperform Treasuries across any maturity timescale! For fixedincome and bond allocations, institutional investors are lining up for buying treasuries. And yet here you are saying \"CDs are not worth it.\" Might want to rethink that. Now going into the stock market as an investor with expectations of those high returns you quote, means youre willing to stay there for the longterm at least a decade and stay the course during volatility to actually have any hope of coming up with the average rate of return. Even then, theres the potential downside of risk that you still lose principal after that duration. So given that assumption, its only fair to compare against  10 year CDs which are currently rated at 2 percent APY. In addition, CDs can be laddered  allowing you to lockin newer and potentially higher rates as they become available. You essentially stagger your buyin into these investments, and either reinvest upon the stilted maturity dates or use as income. Also keep in mind that while personal emergencies requiring quick access to cash can happen at any time, the most common scenario is during the sudden change from a bull market into a recession  the time when stocks plummet. If you need money right away, selling your stocks at these times would lock in severe losses, whereas with CDs you still wont lose principal with an early exit and the only penalty is usually a sacrifice of a few months of potential interest. Its easy to think of the high yields during a protracted bull market such as now, but personal finance has a huge behavioral component to it that is largely ignored until its too late. One risk that isnt taken care of by either CDs or Treasuries is inflation risk. All the rates here and in the original question are nominal rates, and the real return will depend on inflation or deflation. There are other options here besides CDs, Treasuries, and the stock market to outpace inflation if youd like to hedge that risk with inflation protection Series I Savings Bonds and TIPS."

When discount brokers came along and started offering 2  9.99 trades, it was simply because these new companies could be competitive in a place where incumbents were overcharging.

The market landscape and costs have changed over the last decade with regulation NMS, and other brokerage firms never needed to update drastically because they could continue making a lot on commissions with nobody questioning it. The conclusion being that other brokers can also charge a lot less, despite their other overhead costs. Robinhood, like other brokerage firms and anyone else trading directly with the exchanges, are paid by the exchanges for adding liquidity. Not only are many trades placed with no commission for the broker, they actually earn money for placing the trade. If Robinhood was doing you any favors, they would be paying you.

If no property, you would have .036N to live on after taxes. But with the property, that drops to .008N. Given the constraints of the problem, .008N could be anywhere from 8k to 80k. So if we ignore housing, can you live on 8k a year? If so, then no problem. If not, then you need to constrain N more or make do with less house. On the bright side, you dont have to pay rent out of the .008N. You still need housing out of the .036N without the house. These formulas should be considered examples. I dont know how much your property taxes might be. Nor do I know how much youll pay in taxes. Heck, I dont know that youll average a 5 return after inflation. You may have to put some of the money into cash equivalents with negligible return. But this should allow you to research more what your situation really is. If we set returns to 3.5 after inflation and 2.4 after inflation and taxes, that changes the numbers slightly but importantly. The \"no house\" number becomes .024N. The \"with house\" number becomes So thats 24,000 which needs to include rent versus 800 no rent needed. There is not enough money in that plan to have any remainder to live on in the \"with house\" option. Given the constraints for N and these assumptions about returns, you would be 800 to 8000 short every year. This continues to assume that property taxes are 10 of the property value annually. Lower property taxes would of course make this better. Higher property taxes would be even less feasible. When comparing to people with homes, remember the option of selling the home.

India is running a budget deficit of 4 odd  for last 67 years, which means that gov.in is spending more than their revenue collection, this money is not in the system, so the govt. has to print the money, either the direct 4 or the interest it has to pay on the money it borrows to cover the 4 dont confuse this with US printing post 2008. After printing, the supply of INR is more compared to USD in the market INR is current AC convertible, value of INR w.r.t. USD falls in simplistic terms. There is another impact of this printing, it increases the money supply in domestic market leading to inflation and overall price rise. To contain this price rise, Reserve Bank of India RBI increases the interest rates and increases Compulsory Reserve Ratio CRR, thus trying to pulllockup money, so that overall money supply decreases, but there is a limit to which RBI can do this as overall growth rate keeps falling as money is more expensive to borrow to invest. The above in simplistic term how this is working. However, there are many factors in economy and the above should be treated as it is intended to, a simplistic view only."

    "body": "Two adages come to mind. Never finance a depreciating asset. If you cant pay cash for a car, you cant afford it. If you decide you can finance at a low rate and invest at a higher one, youre leveraging your capital. The risk here is that your investment drops in value, or your cash flow stops and you are unable to continue payments and have to sell the car, or surrender it. There are fewer risks if you buy the car outright. There is one cost that is not considered though. Opportunity cost. Since youve declared transportation necessary, Id say that opportunity cost is worth the lower risk, assuming you have enough cash left after buying a car to fund your emergency fund. Which brings me to my final point. Be sure to buy a quality used car, not a new one. Your emergency fund should be able to replace the car completely, in the case of a total loss where you are at fault and the loss is not covered by insurance. TLDR My opinion is that it would be better to pay for a quality, efficient, basic transportation car up front than to take on a debt."

Savers get a rate between what the Fed gives and what the bank gets. When times are tough the Fed will lower their rate to try to increase the lending that banks do. This is called Qualitive Easing.

I do not know for certain but I have heard that often times you will end up paying more this way then even a W2 employees. Second, an LLC allows you to deduct business expenses off the top prior to determining what you pay in taxes as passthrough income. With 1099 you pay the same taxes regardless of your business expenses unless they are specifically allowed as a 1099 contractor which most are not I believe. So what you should really do is figure out the expense you incur as a result of doing your business and check with an accountant to see if those expenses would be deductible in an LLC and if it offsets a decent amount of your income to see if it would be worth it. But I have read a lot of books and listened to a lot of interviews about wealthy people and most deal in companies not contracts. Most would open a new business and add clients rather than dealing in 1099 contracts. Just my two cents... Good luck and much prosperity."

In Australia pretty much all bills you receive can be paid in a number of ways For small amounts between friends cash is probably used most, but for larger amounts direct transfer is popular. Your friendlandlord will give you their bank account number and BSB number, which identifies their bank, and then you transfer the money in. We dont have a SSN like some other countries. Cheques are still used by some however, esp by the older generations. Now that Im in the US initially I had tried to set up direct transfer to pay my rent however the bank has a 1000 daily transfer limit. I contacted the bank to get this increased however I was informed that this limit applies to ALL accounts at the bank. I asked how do people pay their rents with this low limit and was told that most people used cheques. This explains the strange look I got from my landlord when I asked for their bank account details so I could pay the rent! I now have some bills to pay here and I use online banking. You enter the billers name and address and then the bank actually prints off a cheque and posts it to the biller on your behalf!

    "header": "Should I pay cash or prefer a 0 interest loan for home furnishings?",
    "body": "There are several issues with paying for furniture and appliances with 0 credit instead of paying with cash. When you pay with 0 credit, you might be tempted to spend more on something than you would have if you paid with cash, because it feels like free money, and youve justified in your mind that the extra you earn will help pay for the more expensive item. Businesses dont offer 0 credit for free, and they dont lose money on the deal. When you shop at a store that offers 0 credit, you are generally overpaying for the item. By shopping at a store that does not offer 0 credit, you might be able to get a better price. Your savings account is likely earning very little interest. You might invest the money you intend for your purchases in a place that gets better returns, but in most of these places the returns are not guaranteed, and you might not do as well as you think. 0 loans typically come with lots of conditions that have very heavy penalties and interest rate hikes for late payments. You can mitigate this risk by setting up automatic payments, but things can still go wrong. Your bank might change your account number, making the automated payment fail. As you mentioned, you might also forget to put the proper amount of money in the account. A single mistake can negate all of the tiny gains you are trying to achieve. Ultimately, the decision is yours, of course, but in my opinion, there is very, very little to gain with buying something on 0 credit when you could be paying cash."

    "body": "It is barely possible that this is Citis fault, but it sounds more like it is on the Costco end. The way that this is supposed to work is that they preauthorize your card for the necessary amount. That reserves the payment, removing the money from your credit line. On delivery, they are supposed to capture the preauthorization. That causes the money to transfer to them. Until that point, theyve reserved your payment but not actually received it. If you cancel, then they dont have to pay processing fees. The capture should allow for a larger sale so as to provide for tips, upsells, and unanticipated taxes and fees. In this case, instead of capturing the preauthorization, they seem to have simply generated a new transaction. Citi could be doing something wrong and processing the capture incorrectly. Or Costco could be doing a purchase when they should be doing a capture. From outside, we cant really say. The thirty days would seem to be how long Costco can schedule in advance. So the preauthorization can last that long for them. Costco should also have the ability to cancel a preauthorization. However, they may not know how to trigger that. With smaller merchants, they usually have an interface where they can view preauthorizations and capture or cancel them. Costco may have those messages sent automatically from their system. Note that a common use for this pattern is with things like gasoline or delivery purchases. If this has been CitiCostco both times, Id try ordering a pizza or some other delivery food and see if they do it correctly. If it was Citi both times and a different merchant the other time, then its probably a Citi problem rather than a merchant problem."

But there were a few times where the rate offered was identical, and I still choose C2C because it enabled me to deduct many of my business expenses that I wouldnt have otherwise been able to deduct. In my case the deductions turned out to be greater than the FICA savings. Your case is slightly different than mine though in that I already had the company set up so my company related costs were \"sunk\" as far as my decision was concerned.

    "body": "I hope a wall of text with citations qualifies as \"relatively easy.\" Many of these studies are worth quoting at length. Long story short, a great deal of research has found that activelymanaged funds underperform market indexes and passivelymanaged funds because of their high turnover and higher fees, among other factors. Longer answer Chris is right in stating that survivorship bias presents a problem for such research however, there are several academic papers that address the survivorship problem, as well as the wider subject of active vs. passive performance. Ill try to provide a brief summary of some of the relevant literature. The seminal paper that started the debate is Michael Jensens 1968 paper titled \"The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 19451964\". This is the paper where Jensens alpha, the ubiquitous measure of the performance of mutual fund managers, was first defined. Using a dataset of 115 mutual fund managers, Jensen finds that The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buythemarketandhold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. Although this paper doesnt address problems of survivorship, its notable because, among other points, it found that managers who actively picked stocks performed worse even when fund expenses were ignored. Since activelymanaged funds tend to have higher expenses than passive funds, the actual picture looks even worse for actively managed funds. A more recent paper on the subject, which draws similar conclusions, is Martin Grubers 1996 paper \"Another puzzle The growth in actively managed mutual funds\". Gruber calls it \"a puzzle\" that investors still invest in activelymanaged funds, given that their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. He addresses survivorship bias by tracking funds across the entire sample, including through mergers. Since most mutual funds that disappear are merged into existing funds, he assumes that investors in a fund that disappear choose to continue investing their money in the fund that resulted from the merger. Using this assumption and standard measures of mutual fund performance, Gruber finds that mutual funds underperform an appropriately weighted average of the indices by about 65 basis points per year. Expense ratios for my sample averaged 113 basis points a year. These numbers suggest that active management adds value, but that mutual funds charge the investor more than the value added. Another nice paper is Mark Carharts 1997 paper \"On persistence in mutual fund performance\" uses a sample free of survivorship bias because it includes \"all known equity funds over this period.\" Its worth quoting parts of this paper in full I demonstrate that expenses have at least a oneforone negative impact on fund performance, and that turnover also negatively impacts performance. ... Trading reduces performance by approximately 0.95 of the trades market value. In reference to expense ratios and other fees, Carhart finds that The investment costs of expense ratios, transaction costs, and load fees all have a direct, negative impact on performance. The study also finds that funds with abnormally high returns last year usually have higherthanexpected returns next year, but not in the following years, because of momentum effects. Lest you think the news is all bad, Russ Wermers 2000 study \"Mutual fund performance An empirical decomposition into stockpicking talent, style, transactions costs, and expenses\" provides an interesting result. He finds that many activelymanaged mutual funds hold stocks that outperform the market, even though the net return of the funds themselves underperforms passive funds and the market itself. On a netreturn level, the funds underperform broad market indexes by one percent a year. Of the 2.3 difference between the returns on stock holdings and the net returns of the funds, 0.7 per year is due to the lower average returns of the nonstock holdings of the funds during the period relative to stocks. The remaining 1.6 per year is split almost evenly between the expense ratios and the transaction costs of the funds. The final paper Ill cite is a 2008 paper by Fama and French of the FamaFrench model covered in business schools titled, appropriately, \"Mutual Fund Performance\". The paper is pretty technical, and somewhat above my level at this time of night, but the authors state one of their conclusions bluntly quite early on After costs that is, in terms of net returns to investors active investment is a negative sum game. Emphasis mine. In short, expense ratios, transaction costs, and other fees quickly diminish the returns to active investment. They find that The [valueweight] portfolio of mutual funds that invest primarily in U.S. equities is close to the market portfolio, and estimated before fees and expenses, its alpha is close to zero. Since the [valueweight] portfolio of funds produces an  close to zero in gross returns, the alpha estimated on the net returns to investors is negative by about the amount of fees and expenses. This implies that the higher the fees, the farther alpha decreases below zero. Since activelymanaged mutual funds tend to have higher expense ratios than passivelymanaged index funds, its safe to say that their net return to the investor is worse than a market index itself. I dont know of any free datasets that would allow you to research this, but one highlyregarded commercial dataset is the CRSP SurvivorBiasFree US Mutual Fund Database from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago. In financial research, CRSP is one of the \"gold standards\" for historical market data, so if you can access that data perhaps for a firm or academic institution, if youre affiliated with one that has access, its one way you could run some numbers yourself."

You are very likely in the 33 tax bracket married filing jointly income range of 231,450 to 413,350, so your wifes additional income will effectively be taxed at 33 plus 15 for selfemployment taxes. Rounding to 50 means you need to withhold 19,000 over the year or slightly less depending on what business expenses you can deduct. You could use a similar calculation for CA state taxes. You can either just add this gross additional amount to your withholdings, or make an estimated tax payment every quarter. Any difference will be made up when you file your 2017 taxes. So long as you withhold 100 of your total tax liability from last year, you should not have any underpayment penalties."

    "body": "Given the state of the economy, and the potential of a rough near future for us recent grads i.e. onoff work, I would recommend holding off on large purchases while your life is in flux. This includes both a NEW car and purchasing a house. My short answer is you need a reliable vehicle, so purchase a used car, from a major dealer yes this will add a fairly high premium, but easier financing, that is 45 years old, or more. Barring the major dealer purchase, be sure to get a mechanic to check out a vehicle, many will offer this service for a reasonable payment. As people point out, cars these days will run for another 100k miles. You will NOT have to pay anywhere near 27,000 for this vehicle. You may need to leverage your 10k for a loan if you choose to finance, but it should not be a problem, especially as you seem to imply an established credit history. In addition to this, start saving your money for the house you would like to eventually get. We have no idea where you live, but, picking rough numbers, assuming a 2 year buy period, 20 down, and a 250,000 home, the down payment alone will require you to save 2,000month starting now. Barring either of these options, max out your money to tax sheltered accounts your Roth IRA, work 401k, or a regular IRA asap. Obviously, do not deplete your emergency fund, if anything, increase it. 10k can be burned through in a heartbeat. Long Answer I purchased a brand new car, right out of school, at a reasonable interest rate. Like you, I can afford this vehicle, however, if someone were to come to me today 3.5 years later and offer me the opportunity to take it back and purchase a 45 year used vehicle, at a 45 year used car price, albeit at a much higher interest rate since I financed, it would be about a 0.02 second decision. I like my car, but, Id like the differential cash savings between it and a reliable used car more. 27,000 is also fairly expensive for a new vehicle, there are many, very nice vehicles, for 2123k. I still would not consider these priced appropriate to spend your money on them, but they exist. However, you do very much need a reliable vehicle, and I think you should get one. On the home front, your 400 all inclusive rent is insanely cheap. Many people spend more than that on property tax and PMI each year, so anyone who throws the \"Youre throwing money away!\" line at you is blowing smoke to justify their own home purchase. Take the money you would have spent on a mortgage, and squirrel it away. Do your own due diligence and research the home market in your area and decide for yourself if you think home prices have bottomed and will stay there, have further to go, or are going to begin to rise. That is a decision only you can make for yourself. Id add a section about getting expenses under control, but you said you could save 50 of your takehome pay. This is an order of magnitude above the average. Good job. Try doing 50 for 4 months, then calculate your actual amount. Then try to beat it."

    "body": "Buffett is a value investor. His goal is to buy good companies when the market is overly worried and prices them below intrinsic value. When the market is highly priced it is much more difficult for him to find things that he thinks are at an attractive price. When people are very worried and the market has crashed, stocks are then priced below their intrinsic value and he can use the cash he keeps in the company to make attractive purchases. Remember that Buffett is not concerned with the ups and downs of the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock, he is concerned with the economic value of the assets that the company owns. So if all stock prices crash and he can buy things that are at bargain prices, he is happy no matter what Berkshire stock price does in the short run. One consequence of value investing is that because you are buying assets at bargain prices, the total value of your assets drops less in a bear market than the highly priced stuff that drives the major indexes."

File the 1040 correctly, and then deal with SNAP as you note. Do deal with SNAP, though otherwise they might be in trouble if SNAP notices the discrepancy in an audit of their paperwork. Further, SNAP doesnt necessarily care here either. SNAP defines a household as the people who live together in a house and share expenses a separated couple who neither shared expenses nor lived together would not be treated as a single household, and thus one or both would separately qualify. See this Geeks on Finance article or this Federal SNAP page for more details and ask the state program administrator. It may well be that this has no impact for himher.

Note that depending on the exact circumstances, your friend might have another option other than Married Filing Jointly. If the following are true Then she may file as \"Head of Household\", and her soontobe ex would file as \"Married Filing Separately\", unless she also has dependents which would separately allow filing as Head of Household.

    "body": "Keep in mind there are a couple of points to ponder here Rates are really low. With rates being so low, unless there is deflation, it is pretty easy to see even moderate inflation of 12 being enough to eat the yield completely which would be why the returns are negative. Inflation is still relatively contained. With inflation low, there is no reason for the central banks to raise rates which would give new bonds a better rate. Thus, this changes in CPI are still in the range where central banks want to be stimulative with their policy which means rates are low which if lower than inflation rates would give a negative real return which would be seen as a way to trigger more spending since putting the money into treasury debt will lose money to inflation in terms of purchasing power. A good question to ponder is has this happened before in the history of the world and what could we learn from that point in time. The idea for investors would be to find alternative holdings for their cash and bonds if they want to beat inflation though there are some inflationindexed bonds that arent likely appearing in the chart that could also be something to add to the picture here."

That being said, I found two articles, [1] and [2] that give some relevant details that you might find helpful. The articles state that Many artists end up with a combination of income types income from regular wages and income from selfemployment. Income from wages involves a regular paycheck with all appropriate taxes, social security, and Medicare withheld. Income from selfemployment may be in the form of cash, check, or goods, with no withholding of any kind. They provide a breakdown for expenses and deductions based on the type of income you receive. If you get a regular paycheck If youve got a gig lasting more than a few weeks, chances are you will get paid regular wages with all taxes withheld. At the end of the year, your employer will issue you a form W2. If this regular paycheck is for entertainmentrelated work and not just for waiting tables to keep the rent paid, you will deduct related expenses on a Schedule A, under \"Unreimbursed Employee business expenses,\" or on Form 2106, which will give you a total to carry to the schedule A. The type of expenses that go here are If you are considered an independent contractor I presume this includes the value of goods, based on the first quoted paragraph above Independent contractors get paid by cash or check with no withholding of any kind. This means that you are responsible for all of the Social Security and Medicare normally paid or withheld by your employer this is called SelfEmployment Tax. In order to take your deductions, you will need to complete a Schedule C, which breaks down expenses into even more detail. In addition to the items listed above, you will probably have items in the following categories Ideally, you should receive a 1099 MISC from whatever employers paid you as an independent contractor. Keep in mind that some states have a nonresident entertainers tax, which is A state tax levied against performers whose legal residence is outside of the state where the performance is given. The tax requires that a certain percentage of any gross earnings from the performance be withheld for the state. Seriously, keep all of your receipts, pay stubs, W2s, 1099 forms, contracts written on the backs of napkins, etc. and go see a tax professional."

In your question the highest max limit on one card is 2500, what will you do if you have to take a flight at the last minute and the Airline ticket is more than that? If you need a higher limit, ask for one of your existing cards to raise it dont go out and get another card.

It may have paid the quarterly dividend like clockwork for the last decade, that does not guarantee it will pay this quarter. Regarding question number 2. Yield is generally an after the fact calculation. Dividends are paid out of current or retained earnings. If the company becomes hot and the stock price doubles, but earnings are relatively similar, the dividend will not be doubled to maintain the prior yield the yield will instead be halved because the dividend per share was made more expensive to attain due to the increased share price. As for the calculation, obviously your yield will likely vary from the yield published on services like Google and Yahoo finance. The variation is strictly based on the price you paid for the share. Dividend per share is a declared amount. Assuming a 10 share paying a quarterly dividend of 0.25 your yield is Now figure that you paid 8.75 for the share. Now the way dividends are allocated to shareholders depends on dates published when the dividend is declared. The day you purchase the share, the day your transaction clears etc are all vital to being paid a particular dividend. Heres a link to the SEC with related information httpswww.sec.govanswersdividen.htm I suppose it goes without saying but, historical dividend payments should not be your sole evaluation criteria. Personally, I would be extremely wary of a company paying a 40 dividend 1 quarterly dividend on a 10 stock, its very possible that in your example bar corp is a more sound investment.

    "body": "Considering the historical political instability of your nation, real property may have higher risk than normal. In times of political strife, real estate plummets, precisely when the moneys needed. At worst, the property may be seized by the next government. Also, keeping the money within the country is even more risky because bank accounts are normally looted by either the entering govt or exiting one. The safest long run strategy with the most potential for your family is to get the money out into various stable nations with good history of protecting foreign investors such as Switzerland, the United States, and Hong Kong. Once out, the highest expected return can be expected from internationally diversified equities however, it should be known that the value will be very variant year to year."

    "body": "Its not impossible to forecast the future price of a commodity. However, its exactly that an educated guess, much like the weather, and the further out that prediction is made, the higher the percentage error is expected. A lot of information is gathered by various instruments, spotters etc at a very high cost of time and money, to produce a prediction that starts breaking down after about five days and is no more than a wild guess after about ten. How accurately a price can be forecast depends on the commodity. There are seasonal and thus cyclical changes in many commodities, on top of which there is a general trend which is nearer term. A pretty decent prediction can thus be arrived at with a relatively simple seasonallyadjusted percentage change algorithm take a moving average of the last few measurements, compute the percent change versus the same period last year current minus last divided by last and multiply it by last years number for the current day or month to arrive at a pretty decent prediction for the current and nearfuture periods up to about as far ahead as you have looked behind. Another thing you may need to do is normalize. Many price graphs are very jittery the price of a stock may fluctuate many percentage points on a single day, and theres a lot of \"noise\" inherent in them. A common tool to normalize is a boxandwhisker plot, which for a given time period will aggregate all samples within that period, and give you a measurement of the lowest sample, highest sample, median, and quartiles the range of each 25 of the full sample space. Box plots can also be plotted on the \"interquartile range\" or \"middle fifty\" this throws away the very noisy outliers and constructs a much more regular plot from the inner part of the bell curve. You can reverseengineer a bestfit line connecting the elements of each box, and the closer two lines are, the more likely the real future data will be around that area because the quartile between those to lines is very dense 25 of the values are in a very small range meaning many samples occurred there. Lastly, there are outside factors that are not included in simple percentage growth. Big news must be taken into account by introducing more subjective guesses about future data. If you see an active hurricane season coming or a hurricane bearing down on GalvestonHouston then its reasonable to assume that the price of oil andor refined oil products like gas and jet fuel will skyrocket. A cyclical growth model will not predict these events, but you can factor in the likelihood of a big change with a base onto which you add last years numbers, and onto that you add regular growth. Conversely, when a huge spike happens due to a noncyclical event like a natural disaster, you must smooth it out by reducing the readings to fit in the curve, otherwise your model for next year will expect the same anomaly at the same time and so it will be wrong. These adjustments are necessary, but the more of them you make, the less the graph reflects real history and the more it reflects what you think it should have been."

    "header": "What is the US tax owed when gifting India Shares to my brother?",
    "body": "Heres an excerpt from the Charles Schwab website which I think will help evaluate your position The simple answer to your question is no, the value of a gift of stock for gift tax liability is NOT the donors cost basis, but rather the fair market value of the stock at the time the gift is given. So lets say you purchased 100 shares of XYZ stock at 50 a share. Your cost basis is 5,000. Now the stock is 80 a share and you give it as a gift. The value of your gift for gift tax purposes is 8,000. In 2015, you can give up to 14,000 to an unlimited number of individuals each year without paying a gift tax or even reporting the gifts. If you give over that amount to any individual, however, you must report the gift on your tax return, but you dont have to pay taxes until you give away more than the current lifetime limit of 5,430,000for the amount above and beyond 14,000 per person per year. So in the example above, there would be no gift tax liability. However, if the stock happened to be 150 a share, the value of the gift would be 15,000. Youd then have to report it and 1,000 would be applied toward your 5,430,000 lifetime exclusion. You will need to pay a gift tax on the current value of the stock. Im not familiar with the tax laws in India, but if your brother was in the US, he wouldnt pay taxes on that gift until he sells the stock. The recipient doesnt have to worry about gift taxes. Its when the recipient decides to sell the stock that the issue of valuation comes upfor income taxes. And this is where things can get a bit more complicated. In general, when valuing a gift of stock for capital gains tax liability, its the donors cost basis and holding period that rules. As an example, lets say you receive a gift of stock from your grandfather. He bought it for 10 a share and its worth 15 a share on the day you receive it. If you then sell the stock, whether for a gain or a loss, your cost basis will be the same as your grandfathers 10 per share. Sell it at 25 and youll pay tax at the short or longterm rate, depending on how long he owned the stock on a gain of 15 a share sell it at 8 and your capital loss will be 2 a share. Ultimately, with a gift this large that also crosses international borders, you really should hire a professional who is experienced with these types of transactions. Their feescommission will be completely offset by the savings in risk and paperwork. httpwww.schwab.compublicschwabnnarticlesHowDoYouValueaGiftofStockItDependsonWhetherYouretheGiverortheReceiver"

    "body": "The short answer is that you can use student loans for living expenses. Joe provides a nice taxonomy of loans. I would just add that some loans are not only guaranteed, but also subsidized. Essentially the Government buys down the rate of the loan. The mechanics are that a financial aid package might consist of grants, work study job, subsidized, and guaranteed loans. One can turn down one or more of the elements of the package. All will be limited in some form. The work study will have a maximum number of hours and generally has low pay. Many find better deals working in the businesses surrounding the college or starting their own services type business. The grants rarely cover the full cost of tuition and books. The loans will both be limited in amount. It mainly depends on what you qualify for, and generally speaking the lower the income the more aid one qualifies for. Now some students use all their grant, all their loan money and buy things that are not necessary. For example are you going to live in the 450month dorm, or the new fancy apartments that are running 800month? Are you going to use the student loan money to buy a car? Will it be a new BMW or a 8 year old Camary? I see this first hand as I live near a large university. The pubs are filled with college students, not working, but drinking and eating every night. Many of them drive very fancy cars. The most onerous example of this is students at the military academies. Attendees have their books and tuition completely paid for. They also receive a stipend, and more money can be earned over the summer. They also all qualify for a 35K student loan in their junior year. Just about every kid, takes this loan. Most of those use the money to buy a car. I know a young lady who did exactly that, and so did many of her friends. So kids with a starting pay of 45K also start life with a 35K. Buying a nice car in the military is especially silly as they cannot drive it while deployed and they are very likely to be deployed. At least, however, they are guaranteed a starting job with a nice starting pay, and upward potential. College kids who behave similarly might not have it as good. Will they even find work? Will the job have the ability to move up? How much security is in the job? One might say that this does not apply to engineers and such, but I am working with a fellow with a computer science degree who cannot find a job and has not worked in the past 6 months. This even though the market is super hot right now for computer engineers. So, in a word, be very careful what you borrow."

    "header": "Why might a roboadvisor service like Betterment be preferable to just buying a single wellperforming index fund like SPY?",
    "body": "This is Ellie Lan, investment analyst at Betterment. To answer your question, American investors are drawn to use the SP 500 SPY as a benchmark to measure the performance of Betterment portfolios, particularly because its familiar and its the index always reported in the news. However, going all in to invest in SPY is not a good investment strategyand even using it to compare your own diversified investments is misleading. We outline some of the pitfalls of this approach in this article Why the SP 500 Is a Bad Benchmark. An algoadvisor service like Betterment is a preferable approach and provides a number of advantages over simply investing in ETFs SPY or others like VOO or IVV that track the SP 500. So, why invest with Betterment rather than in the SP 500? Lets first look at the issue of diversification. SPY only exposes investors to stocks in the U.S. large cap market. This may feel acceptable because of home bias, which is the tendency to invest disproportionately in domestic equities relative to foreign equities, regardless of their home country. However, investing in one geography and one asset class is riskier than global diversification because inflation risk, exchangerate risk, and interestrate risk will likely affect all U.S. stocks to a similar degree in the event of a U.S. downturn. In contrast, a welldiversified portfolio invests in a balance between bonds and stocks, and the ratio of bonds to stocks is dependent upon the investment horizon as well as the individuals goals. By constructing a portfolio from stock and bond ETFs across the world, Betterment reduces your portfolios sensitivity to swings. And the diversification goes beyond mere asset class and geography. For example, Betterments basket of bond ETFs have varying durations e.g., shortterm Treasuries have an effective duration of less than six months vs. U.S. corporate bonds, which have an effective duration of just more than 8 years and credit quality. The level of diversification further helps you manage risk. Dan Egan, Betterments Director of Behavioral Finance and Investing, examined the increase in returns by moving from a U.S.only portfolio to a globally diversified portfolio. On a riskadjusted basis, the Betterment portfolio has historically outperformed a simple DIY investor portfolio by as much as 1.8 per year, attributed solely to diversification. Now, lets assume that the investor at hand Investor A is a sophisticated investor who understands the importance of diversification. Additionally, lets assume that he understands the optimal allocation for his age, risk appetite, and investment horizon. Investor A will still benefit from investing with Betterment. Automating his portfolio management with Betterment helps to insulate Investor A from the behavior gap, or the tendency for investors to sacrifice returns due to bad timing. Studies show that individual investors lose, on average, anywhere between 1.2 to 4.3 due to the behavior gap, and this gap can be as high as 6.5 for the most active investors. Compared to the average investor, Betterment customers have a behavior gap that is 1.25 lower. How? Betterment has implemented smart design to discourage market timing and shortsighted decision making. For example, Betterments Tax Impact Preview feature allows users to view the tax hit of a withdrawal or allocation change before a decision is made. Currently, Betterment is the only automated investment service to offer this capability. This function allows you to see a detailed estimate of the expected gains or losses broken down by short and longterm, making it possible for investors to make better decisions about whether shortterm gains should be deferred to the longterm. Now, for the sake of comparison, lets assume that we have an even more sophisticated investor Investor B, who understands the pitfalls of the behavior gap and is somehow able to avoid it. Betterment is still a better tool for Investor B because it offers a suite of taxefficient features, including tax loss harvesting, smarter costbasis accounting, municipal bonds, smart dividend reinvesting, and more. Each of these strategies can be automatically deployed inside the portfolioInvestor B need not do a thing. Each of these strategies can boost returns by lowering tax exposure. To return to your initial questionwhy not simply invest in the SP 500? Investing is a longterm proposition, particularly when saving for retirement or other goals with a time horizon of several decades. To be a successful longterm investor means employing the core principles of diversification, tax management, and behavior management. While the SP might look like a hot investment one year, there are always reversals of fortune. The goal with longterm passive investingthe kind of investing that Betterment offersis to help you reach your investing goals as efficiently as possible. Lastly, Betterment offers bestinindustry advice about where to save and how much to save for no fee."

Your credit score is based on your likely hood of being profitable to a creditor should they issue you credit. This is based on your history of your ability to manage your credit. Having more credit and managing it well shows that you have a history of being responsible with greater sums of money available. If you use the card responsibly now then you are more likely to continue that trend than someone with a history of irresponsibility. Having a line but not using it is not a good thing. It costs the creditor money for you to have an account. If you never use that account then you are not showing that you can use the account responsibly so if you are just going to throw the card in a safe and never access it then you are better off not getting the card in the first place."

    "body": "Bloomberg suggests that two Fidelity funds hold preferred shares of Snapchat Inc.. Preferred shares hold more in common with bonds than with ordinary stock as they pay a fixed dividend, have lower liquidity, and dont have voting rights. Because of this lower liquidity they are not usually offered for sale on the market. Whether these funds are allowed to hold such illiquid assets is more a question for their strategy document than the law it is completely legal for a company to hold a nonmarketable interest in another, even if the company is privately held as Snapchat is. The strategy documents governing what the fund is permitted to hold, however, may restrict ownership either banning nonmarket holdings or restricting the percentage of assets held in illiquid instruments. Since IPO is very costly, funds like these who look to invest in new companies who have not been through IPO yet are a very good way of taking a diversified position in startups. Since they look to invest directly rather than through the market they are an attractive, low cost way for startups to generate funds to grow. The fund deals directly with the owners of the company to buy its shares. The markdown of the stock value reflects the accounting principle of marking to market MTM financial assets that do not have a trade price so as to reflect their fair value. This markdown implies that Fidelity believe that the total NPV of the companys net assets is lower than they had previously calculated. This probably reflects a lack of revenue streams coming into the business in the case of Snapchat. edit by the way, since there is no market for startup \"stocks\" preIPO my heart sinks a little every time I read the title of this question.

This way instead of 30 of your new hires being a dud, its more like 5, because the bad ones were filtered out in the intern process. If you are selfmotivated and good enough, then its quite possible that you will start getting real work while youre at the company, as opposed to throwaway assignments that nobody cares about. Once youre in that position, it means they trust you to actually accomplish something, and you will be viewed as a hopeful hire. Assuming you like the company, getting into that position is half the value of the internship.

Its really the ability to limit the risk for the returns  this really translates to limiting the volatility.

If you can refinance to a 15year mortgage, or from a adjustable mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage. it can make sense. You can save on the monthly payment, and on the total cost of the mortgage. But dont buy to take advantage of rates or to save on taxes or to build a guaranteed equity. These can be false economies or things that cant be gaurenteed.

    "body": "Victor, Yes the drop in price does completely cancel the dividend at first. However, as others have noted, there are other forces working on the price as well. If dividends were pointless then the following scenario would be true Lets assume, hypothetically, two identical stocks, only one of which pays a 2 annual dividend quarterly. At the end of the year we would expect the share price of the dividend stock to be 2 lower than the nondividend stock. And an equal investment in both stocks would yield exactly the same amount of money. So that is a hypothetical, and here is real market example I compared, i.e. took the ratio of Vanguards SP 500 ETF VOO closing price to the SP 500 Index closing price from sep 9, 20102014, after accounting for the VOO 2013 split. The VOO pays a quarterly dividendabout 2year, the SP is an index, hence no dividend. The VOO share price, reduced each quarter by the dividend, still grew more than the SP each year except 2012 to 2013, but looking at the entire 4yr period the VOO share price grew 80.3987 while SP grew 80.083 13 of 1 more for VOO. VOO does drop about 12 relative to SP on every ex date, but obviously it makes it up. There are other forces working on VOO. VOO is tradeable, therefore subject to supplydemand pressures, while the SP 500 is not. So for the VOO ETF the data does not indicate pointless dividends but instead implies dividends are free money.

    "body": "As I stated in my comment, options are futures, but with the twist that youre allowed to say no to the agreedon transaction if the market offers you a better deal on whatever you had contracted to buy or sell, you have the option of simply letting it expire. Options therefore are the insurance policy of the free market. You negotiate a future price actually you usually take what you can get if youre an individual investor the institutional fund managers get to negotiate because theyre moving billions around every day, then you pay the other guy up front for the right of refusal later. How much you pay depends on how likely the person giving you this option is to have to make good on it if your position looks like a sure thing, an options going to be very expensive and if its such a sure thing, you should just make your move on the spot market its thus useful to track futures prices to see where the various big players are predicting that your portfolio will move. A put option, which is an option for you to sell something at a future price, is a hedge against loss of value of your portfolio. You can take one out on any single item in your portfolio, or against a portion or even your entire portfolio. If the stock loses value such that the contract price is better than the market price as of the delivery date of the contract, you execute the option otherwise, you let it expire. A call option, which is an option to buy something at a future price, is a hedge against rising costs. The rough analog is a \"preorder\" in retail but more like a \"holding fee\". Theyre unusual in portfolio management but can be useful when moving money around in more complex ways. Basically, if you need to guarantee that you will not pay more than a certain pershare price to buy something in the future, you buy a call option. If the spot price as of the delivery date is less than the contract price, you buy from the market and ignore the contract, while if prices have soared, you exercise it and get the lower contract price. Stock options, offered as benefits in many companies, are a specific form of call option with very generous terms for whomever holds them. A swaption, basically a put and a call rolled into one, allows you to trade something for something else. Call it the free markets \"exchange policy\". For a price, if a security you currently hold loses value, you can exchange it for something else that you predicted would become more valuable at the same time. One example might be airline stocks and crude oil when crude spikes, airline stocks generally suffer, and you can take advantage of this, if it happens, with a swaption to sell your airline stocks for crude oil certificates. There are many such closelyrelated inverse positions in the market, such as between various currencies, between stocks and commodities gold is inversely related to pretty much everything else, and even straightup cashforbaddebt arrangements creditdefault swaps, which we heard so much about in 2008."

A few things I do I shop in affordable places and check out sales, and look for the cutest things I can find there in a reasonable price range. If you arent browsing in the 60 baby dresses, you arent tempted by them. I dont go looking at 60 shirts for my son, hes five and he doesnt need a 60 shirt. I also really only shop for him two or three times a year for clothing...back to school and early spring are the big ones. For fall I got him five pairs of jeans, maybe 8 tops, new socks, etc. Ill add in a couple of heavier sweatshirts, etc as I go, but I really dont browse for him...its too easy to find something to buy! I look for inexpensive lines for the things that dont really matter...bright Ts for my son for summer that just get dirty and spilled on, sleepers, socks, pjs, etc. Joe Fresh, Walmart, Old Navy, Costco. Then I choose a few things that I know I want brand name or more stylish options for, and find ways to buy them more cheaply. These might be things like logod fleece tops, trendy jackets, things where the style is actually noticed. I buy jeans at Old Navy for my son when they are on sale, I buy GustiGenevieve LaPierre snowsuits at Sears when they are 40 off in SeptOct. The Childrens Place has good quality, stylish clothing for kids and if you watch, they always have deals on their jeans or tops...then I stock up. And for younger kids, Old Navy and The Childrens Place jeans have adjustable waistbands. Ive already unrolled cuffs and let out the waist in my sons back to school jeans. I have friends who are starting to take in bags of toosmall clothing to consignment shops...if they come away with 100, its still 100! For preteen and teen kids who want certain brands, etc, I think it is very reasonable to say \"we will pay x for each pair of jeans, or x for winter boots. If you want to throw in some babysittingbirthday money and go buy something more expensive, you are welcome to do so!\" That way, you are still paying for basics, but they can feel like they arent stuck wearing things they dont like. Tell them...you can buy 5 tops at x each for back to school, or 10 tops at x. And lastly, and most sadly of all buy less..and stop shopping. There, I said it out loud. I try to be careful of what I buy, but I still find things I bought that were never worn. Now I keep a return basket in laundrymudroom...if I dont love it, if it seems impractical now that I got it home, if I wanted it just in case item 1 didnt work...it goes in the basket. And I return them. I suck it up, I take it with me and go get my money back. Mistakes can be fixed if the items havent been worn or washed."

Their other 2.4Billion is held in swaptions or cash, unsure how to rate that exposure. All I know is those 13,800 contracts are in contango danger during roll week for the next few months IMO. I wonder if there is a website that tracks inflows and outflows to see if they match up with before and after the roll periods. httpwww.proshares.comfundsucodailyholdings.html How Oil ETFs Work Many oil ETFs invest in oil futures contracts. An oil futures contract is a commitment to buy a given amount of crude oil at a given price on a particular date in the future. Since the purpose of oil ETFs is only to serve as an investment vehicle to track the price of oil, the creators of the fund have no interest in stockpiling actual oil. Therefore, oil ETFs such as USO periodically roll over their futures contracts by selling the contracts that are approaching expiration and buying contracts that expire farther into the future. The Contango Problem While this process of continually rolling over futures contracts may seem like a great way to track the price of crude oil, theres a practical problem with the method contango. The rollover method would work perfectly if oil funds could sell their expiring contracts for the exact same price that they pay for the futures contracts they buy each month. However, in reality, its often true that oil futures contracts get more expensive the farther their expiration date is in the future. That means that every time the oil ETFs roll over their contracts, they lose the difference in value between the contracts they sell and the contracts they buy. Thats why funds like USO, which invests only in WTI light, sweet crude oil futures contracts, dont directly track the performance of the WTI crude oil spot price. httpwww.etftrends.com201501positioningforanoiletfreboundwatchforcontango Due to these reasons, Id deem UCO for swing trading, not for investing buyandhold.

    "body": "An investment portfolio is typically divided into three components All three of those can be accessed through mutual funds or ETFs. A 401k will probably have a small set of mutual funds for you to pick from. Mutual funds may charge you silly expenses if you pick a bad one. Look at the prospectus for the expense ratio. If its over 1 youre definitely paying too much. If its over 0.5 youre probably paying too much. If its less than 0.1 you have a really good deal. US stocks are generally the core holding until you move into retirement or get close to spending the money on something else if its not invested for retirement. International stocks are riskier than US stocks, but provide opportunity for diversification and better returns than the US stocks. Bonds, or fixedincome investments, are generally very safe, but have limited opportunities for returns. They tend to do better when stocks are doing poorly. When youve got a while to invest, you should be looking at riskier investments when you dont, you should be looking for safer investments. A quick and rough rule of thumb is that \"your age should match the portion of your portfolio in bonds\". So if youre 50 years old and approaching retirement in 15 years or so, you should have about 50 in bonds. Roughly. People whose employment and future income is particularly tied to one sector of the market would also do well to avoid investing there, because they already are at risk if it performs badly. For instance, if you work in the technology sector, loading up on tech stocks is extra risky if theres a big bust, youre not just out of a job, your portfolio is dead as well. More exotic options are available to diversify a portfolio While many portfolios could benefit from these sorts of holdings, they come with their own advantages and disadvantages and should be researched carefully before taking a significant stake in them."

Money has value because people believe that they can buy and sell goods and services with it in that economy. How much the value of money is, is determined by how much money there is in comparison to goods and services supply and demand. In most economies it is the job of the federalnational reserve bank to ensure that prices stay stable ie the relationship of goods and services to how much money there is is stable as this is necessary for a well running economy. The federal reserve bank does so by making more printing, decreasing interest rates or less increasing interest rates available to the economy. To determine how much money needs to be in the economy to keep prices stable is incredibly hard as many factors have an impact If the reserve bank gets it wrong and there is more money compared to goods and services than previous, prices will rise to compensate this is inflation If its the other way round is deflation. Since it is commonly regarded that deflation is much more destabilizing to an economy than inflation the reserve banks tend to err on the side of inflation."

Im not sure how stock options affect this, but I expect they would be counted. Probably have an ESOP plan at that point too which is a whole other canowoms. The 5 owner test applies to the current year and also has a oneyear lookback period. If at ANY point, even for a day, an employee was more than 5 owner, they are HCE for that year and next. Yes there is a limit. A company may limit the amount of HCEs to the top 20 of employees by pay like Aganju said.

    "header": "Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?",
    "body": "Is playing the lottery a wise investment? Probably not. Is playing the lottery an investment at all? Probably not though Ill make a remark on that further below. Does it make any sense to play the lottery in order to improve your total asset allocation? If you follow the theory of the Black Swan, it actually might. Let me elaborate. The Black Swan theory says that events that we consider extremely improbable can have an extreme impact. So extreme, in fact, that its value would massively outweigh the combined value of all impacts of all probable events together. In statistical terms, we are speaking about events on the outer limits of the common probablity distribution, so called outliers that have a high impact. Example If you invest 2000 on the stock market today, stay invested for 20 years, and reinvest all earnings, it is probable within a 66 confidence interval that you will have an 8  expected return ER per year on average, giving you a total of roughly 9300. Thats very much simplified, of course, the actual number can be very different depending on the deviations from the ER and when they happen. Now lets take the same 2000 and buy weekly lottery tickets for 20 years. For the sake of simplicity I will forgo an NPV calculation and assume one ticket costs roughly 2. If you should win, which would be an entirely improbable event, your winnings would by far outweigh your ER from investing the same amount. When making models that should be mathematically solvable, these outliers are usually not taken into consideration. Standard portfolio management PM theory is only working within so called confidence intervals up to 99  everything else just wouldnt be practical. In other words, if there is not at least a 1 probability a certain outcome will happen, well ignore it. In practice, most analysts take even smaller confidence intervals, so they ignore even more. Thats the reason, though, why no object that would fall within the realms of this outer limit is an investment in terms of the PM theory. Or at least not a recommendable one. Having said all that, it still might improve your position if you add a lottery ticket to the mix. The Black Swan theory specifically does not only apply to the risk side of things, but also on the chance side. So, while standard PM theory would not consider the lottery ticket an investment, thus not accept it into the asset allocation, the Black Swan theory would appreciate the fact that there is minimal chance of huge success. Still, in terms of valuation, it follows the PM theory. The lottery ticket, while it could be part of some \"investment balance sheet\", would have to be written off to 0 immediately and no expected value would be attached to it. Consequently, such an investment or gamble only makes sense if your other, safe investments give you so much income that you can easily afford it really without having to give up anything else in your life. In other words, you have to consider it money thrown out of the window. So, while from a psychological perspective it makes sense that especially poorer people will buy a lottery ticket, as Eric very well explained, it is actually the wealthier who should consider doing so. If anyone. "

Why?\" For the cash in an estate, yes, that is aftertax money, but consider other assets such as stocks and real estate. Suppose a rich man bought stock in a small computer startup company at 10 a share about 35 years ago, and that stock is now worth 500 a share. The man dies and his will bequeaths the shares to his son. According to US tax law, the sons basis in the shares is 500 per share, that is, if the son sells the shares, his capital gains are computed as if he had purchased the shares for 500 each. The son pays no taxes on the inheritance he receives. The deceased fathers last income tax return filed by the executor of the fathers will does not list the 490share gain as a capital gain since the father did not sell the stock the gain is what is called an unrealized gain, and so there is no income tax due from the father on the 490share. Now, if there is no estate tax whatsoever, the fathers estate tax return pays no tax on that gain of 490 per share either. Would this be considered an equitable system? Should the government not tax the gain at all? It is worth noting that it would be possible for a government to eliminate estate taxes entirely, but instead have tax laws that say that unrealized gains on the deceaseds property would be taxed as capital gains on the deceaseds final tax return."

    "body": "Banks consider investment mortgages and any mortgage where you dont live in the property, as a riskier investment than an owner occupied, home collateral mortgage. The sources of increased risk range from concerns that you will screw up as a landlord, your tenants will destroy the place, you wont have tenants and cant afford to pay the bank, andor youll take out several other investment mortgages and over extend yourself. All of these risks are compounded by the fact that it is harder for the bank to convince you to pay when they cant put you out on the street if you default. Banks lend and invest in money, not real estate, so they would much rather have a paying loan than a foreclosed house, especially with the modern foreclosure glut. The increased risk means the bank will charge higher interest for the loan, may require a higher downpayment, and will require higher lending standards before issuing the loan. A new housing investor can get around these higher prices by living in the home for a few years before renting it out though your lender could possibly require you to renegotiate the loan if you move out too soon."

Given that you want to buy a house soonish, if your money sits in an account somewhere making no interest, youre effectively losing 7 of your cash each year by not keeping up with house prices, meaning youll be able to afford a smaller house with the same money.

Thats one of the jobs of a market maker, to provide liquidity in a market. So, when you buy a stock, you can sell it. When you buy an option, you can sell it. Thats at any time before expiration although how close you do it before the closing bell on expiration FridaySaturday is your discretion. When a market maker lists an option price, they list a bid and an ask. If you are willing to sell at the bid price, they need to purchase it generally speaking. Thats why they put a spread between the bid and ask price, but thats another topic not related to your question  just note the point of them buying at the bid price, and selling at the ask price  thats what theyre saying theyll do. Now, one major difference with options vs. stocks is that options are contracts. So, therefore, we can note just as easily that YOU can sell the option on something particularly if you own either the underlying, or an option deeper in the money. If you own the underlying instrumentstock, and you sell a CALL option on it, this is a strategy typically referred to as a covered call, considered a \"risk reduction\" strategy. You forfeit potential gains on the upside, for money you receive in selling the option. The point of this discussion is, is simply what one buys one can sell what one sells one can buy  thats how a \"market\" is supposed to work. And also, not to think that making money in options is buying first, then selling. It may be selling, and either buying back or ideally that option expiring worthless.  Now, a final example. Lets say you buy a deep in the money call on a stock trading at 150, and you own the 100 calls. At expiration, these have a value of 50. But lets say, you dont have any money in your account, to take ownership of the underlying security you have to come up with the additional 100 per share you are missing. In that case, need to call your broker and see how they handle it, and it will depend on the type of account you have e.g. margin or not, IRA, etc. Generally speaking though, the \"margin department\" makes these decisions, and they look through folks that have options on things that have value, and are expiring, and whether they have the funds in their account to absorb the security they are going to need to own. Exchangewise, options that have value at expiration, are exercised. But what if the person who has the option, doesnt have the funds to own the whole stock? Well, ideally on Monday theyll buy all the shares with the options you have at the current price, and immediately liquidate the amount you cant afford to own, but they dont have to. Im mentioning this detail so that it helps you see whats going or needs to go on with exchanges and brokerages and individuals, so you have a broader picture."

    "header": "How to get a grip on finance? ",
    "body": "I think this question is perfectly on topic, and probably has been asked and answered many times. However, I cannot help myself. Here are some basics however Personal Finance is not only about math. As a guy who \"took vector calculus just for fun\", I have learned that superior math skills do not translate into superior net worth. Personal finance is about 50 behavior. Take a look at the housing crisis, car loans, or payday lenders and you will understand that the desire to be accepted by others often trumps the math surrounding a transaction. Outline your goals What is it that you want in life? A pile of money or to retire early? What does your business look like? How much cash will you need? Do you want to own a ton of rental properties? How does all this happen set intermediate goals. Then get on a budget A budget is a plan to spend your money in advance. Stick to it. From there you can see how much money you have to implement various goals. Are your goals to aggressive? This is really important as people have a tendency to spend more money then they have. Often times when people receive a bonus at work, they spend that one bonus on two or three times over. A budget will prevent this from happening. Get an Emergency Fund Without an emergency fund, you be subject to the financial whims of people involved in your own life and that of the broader marketplace. Once you have one, you are free to invest with impunity and have less stress in a world that deals out plenty. Bad things will happen to you financially, protect against them. The best first investments are simple Invest in yourself. Find a way to make a very healthy income with upward mobility. Also get out and stay out of debt. These things are not sexy, but they pay off in the long run. The next best investment is also simple Index funds. These become the bench mark for all other investments. If you do not stand a good chance of beating the SP 500 index fund, why bother? Just dump the money in the fund and sleep well at night."

Companies that have good potential can over perform their actual value. We saw this regularly in the early days of the internet prior to the .com bust. Companies would go up exponentially based on their ideas and potential. Investors learned from that and are demanding more these days. As a result companies that do not show growth potential go down. Companies that show growth and potential apple and google for 2 easy examples continue to go up. Many companies have specific days where employees can buy and sell stocks. there are minor ripples in the market on these days as the demand and supply are temporarily altered by a large segment of the owner base making trades. For this reason some companies have a closed pool that is only open to inside trades that then executes the orders over time so that the effect is minimized on the actual stock price. This is not happening with face book. Instead many of the investors are dumping their stock directly into the market. These are savvy investors and if there was potential for profit remaining you would not see the full scale exodus from the stock. The fact that it is visible is scaring off investors itself.

Worse still they only have your word for it that you actually own the company, and arent ripping off your employer by pocketing their payment. Even worse, when the company is audited and finds that cheque, the person who wrote it will have to justify and document why they made it out to you or risk being charged with embezzlement. Its very much in their interests to make the cheque out to the company they did business with. Given that, you should really have an account in the name of your business.

Besides voting, you are entitled to receive profit from the company, if the company chooses to pay this out in the form of dividends.

    "header": "Market Making vs Market Taking Quotes vs Orders",
    "body": "Quote driven markets are the predecessors to the modern securities market. Before electronic trading and HFTs specifically, trading was thin and onerous. Today, the average investor can open up a web page, type in a security, and buy at the narrowest spread permitted by regulators with anyone else who wants to take the other side. Before the lines between market maker and speculator became blurred to indistinction, a market maker was one who was contractually obligated to an exchange to provide a bid and ask for a given security on said exchange even though at heart a market maker is still simply a trader despite the obligation. A market maker would simultaneously buy a large amount of securities privately and short the same amount to have no directional bias, exposure to the direction of the security, and commence to making the market. The market maker would estimate its cost basis for the security based upon those initial trades and provide a bid and ask appropriate for the given level of volume. If volumes were high, the spread would be low and vice versa. Market makers who survived crashes and spikes would forgo the potential profit in always providing a steady price and spread, ie increased volume otherwise known as revenue, to maintain no directional bias. In other words, if there were suddenly many buyers and no sellers, hitting the market makers ask, the MM would raise the ask rapidly in proportion to the increased exposure while leaving the bid somewhere below the cost basis. Eventually, a seller would arise and hit the MMs bid, bringing the market makers inventory back into balance, and narrowing the spread that particular MM could provide since a responsible MMs ask could rise very high very quickly if a lack of its volume relative to its inventory made inventory too costly. This was temporarily extremely costly to the trader if there were few market makers on the security the trader was trading or already exposed to. Market makers prefer to profit from the spread, bidding below some predetermined price, based upon the cost basis of the market makers inventory, while asking above that same predetermined cost basis. Traders profit from taking exposure to a securitys direction or lack thereof in the case of some options traders. Because of electronic trading, liquidity rebates offered by exchanges not only to contractually obligated official market makers but also to any trader who posts a limit order that another trader hits, and algorithms that become better by the day, market making HFTs have supplanted the traditional market maker, and there are many HFTs where there previously were few official market makers. This speed and diversification of risk across many many algorithmically market making HFTs have kept spreads to the minimum on large equities and have reduced the same for the smallest equities on major exchanges. Orders and quotes are essentially identical. Both are double sided auction markets with impermenant bids and asks. The difference lies in that nonmarket makers, specialists, etc. orders are not shown to the rest of the market, providing an informational advantage to MMs and an informational disadvantage to the trader. Before electronic trading, this construct was of no consequence since trader orders were infrequent. With the prevalence of HFTs, the informational disadvantage has become more costly, so order driven markets now prevail with much lower spreads and accelerated volumes even though market share for the major exchanges has dropped rapidly and hyperaccelerated number of trades even though the size of individual trades have fallen. The worst aspect of the quote driven market was that traders could not directly trade with each other, so all trades had to go between a market maker, specialist, etc. While this may seem to have increased cost to a trader who could only trade with another trader by being arbitraged by a MM et al, paying more than what another trader was willing to sell, these costs were dwarfed by the potential absence of those market makers. Without a bid or ask at any given time, there could be no trade, so the costs were momentarily infinite. In essence, a quote driven market protects market makers from the competition of traders. While necessary in the days where paper receipts were carted from brokerage to brokerage, and the trader did not dedicate itself to round the clock trading, it has no place in a computerized market. It is more costly to the trader to use such a market, explaining quote driven markets rapid exit."

Publication 17 p 116 specifically instructs taxpayers to adjust their Schedule D reporting by brokers fees Form 1099B transactions. If you sold property, such as stocks, bonds, or certain commodities, through a broker, you should receive Form 1099B or substitute statement from the broker. Use the Form 1099B or the substitute statement to complete Form 8949. If you sold a covered security in 2013, your broker should send you a Form 1099B or substitute statement that shows your basis. This will help you complete Form 8949. Generally, a covered security is a security you acquired after 2010. Report the gross proceeds shown in box 2a of Form 1099B as the sales price in column d of either Part I or Part II of Form 8949, whichever applies. However, if the broker advises you, in box 2a of Form 1099B, that gross proceeds sales price less commissions and option premiums were reported to the IRS, enter that net sales price in column d of either Part I or Part II of Form 8949, whichever applies. Include in column g any expense of sale, such as brokers fees, commissions, state and local transfer taxes, and option premiums, unless you reported the net sales price in column d. If you include an expense of sale in column g, enter E in column f. You can rely on your own records and judgment, if you feel comfortable doing so. Brokers often make incomplete tax reporting. This may have been simpler from their perspective if the broker fees were variable, or integrated, or unknown for a number of clients party to a transaction. If a taxpayer has documentation of the expenses that justify an adjustment, then its perfectly appropriate to include that in the calculations. It is not necessary to report the discrepancy, and it may increase scrutiny to include a written addendum.

For example, the Total Stock Market Index Fund page has a sector breakdown, so if you wanted to get very finegrained with your allocation, you could. Youre probably much better off investing in the index fund, lowcost ETFs, or the lifecycle fund itself, however itll be much cheaper. Doing this for several lifecycle funds should be a good start. Keep in mind, however, that these funds are rebalanced as the target date approaches, so if youre following the allocation of some particular funds, youll have to rebalance as well. If you really want an agebased allocation that you dont have to think about, invest in a lifecycle fund directly. Youll probably pay a lower expense ratio than if you invested in a whole slew of funds directory, and its less work for someone who isnt comfortable managing their portfolio themselves. Furthermore, with Vanguard, the expense ratios are already fairly low. This is only one example of an allocation, however your tolerance of risk, age, etc. may affect what allocation youre willing to accept. Full disclosure Part of my Roth IRA is invested in the Target 2055 fund I used as an example above, and another part uses a similar rebalancing strategy to the one I used above, but with Admiral Share funds, which have higher minimum investments but lower expense ratios."

    "body": "In a comment you say, if the market crashes, doesnt \"regress to the mean\" mean that I should still expect 7 over the long run? That being the case, wouldnt I benefit from intentionally unbalancing my portfolio and going all in on equities? I can can still rebalance using new savings. No. Regress to the mean just tells you that the future rate is likely to average 7. The past rate and the future rate are entirely unconnected. Consider a series The running average is That running average is slowly regressing to the long term mean without ever a member of the series being above 7. Real markets actually go farther than this though. Real value may be increasing by 7 per year, but prices may move differently. Then market prices may revert to the real value. This happened to the SP 500 in 20002002. Then the market started climbing again in 2003. In your system, you would have bought into the falling markets of 2001 and 2002. And you would have missed the positive bond returns in those years. Thats about a 25 annual shift in returns on that portion of your portfolio. Since thats a third of your portfolio, youd have lost 8 more than with the balanced strategy each of those two years. Note that in that case, the market was in an overvalued bubble. The bubble spent three years popping and overshot the actual value. So 2003 was a good year for stocks. But the three year return was still 11. In retrospect, investors should have gone all in on bonds before 2000 and switched back to stocks for 2003. But no one knew that in 2000. People in the know actually started backing off in 1998 rather than 2000 and missed out on the tail end of the bubble. The rebalancing strategy automatically helps with your regression to the mean. It sells expensive bonds and buys cheaper stocks on average. Occasionally it sells modest priced bonds and buys overpriced stocks. But rarely enough that it is a better strategy overall. Incidentally, I would consider a 33 share high for bonds. 30 is better. And that shouldnt increase as you age less than 30 bonds may be practical when you are young enough. Once you get close to retirement five to ten years, start converting some of your savings to cash equivalents. The cash equivalents are guaranteed not to lose value but might not gain much. This gives you predictable returns for your immediate expenses. Once retired, try to keep about five years of expenses in cash equivalents. Then you dont have to worry about short term market fluctuations. Spend down your buffer until the market catches back up. Its true that bonds are less volatile than stocks, but they can still have bad years. A 7030 mix of stocksbonds is safer than either alone and gives almost as good of a return as stocks alone. Adding more bonds actually increases your risk unless you carefully balance them with the right stocks. And if youre doing that, you dont need simplistic rules like a 7030 balance."

    "body": "Yes, it can be a good idea to close unused credit cards. I am going to give some reasons why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts, and then I will talk about why it is NOT necessarily a bad idea. Why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts \"Id like to close the cards.\" That is reason enough. Simplifying your financial life is a good thing. Fewer accounts let you focus your energy on the accounts that you actually use. Unused accounts still need to be monitored for fraud. You mentioned that you have high credit card balances that you are carrying. This may indicate that you have trouble using credit responsibly, and having more credit available to you might be a temptation for you. If these unused cards have annual fees, keeping them open will cost money. Unused cards sometimes get closed by the bank due to inactivity. As a result, the advice often given is that, in addition to not closing them, you are supposed to charge something to it every month. This, of course, takes more of your time and energy to worry about, as well as giving you another monthly bill to pay. Why it is NOT necessarily a bad idea to close unused accounts Other answers will tell you that it may hurt your credit score for two reasons it would increase your utilization and lower your average account age. Before we talk about the validity of these two points, we need to discuss the importance of the credit score. Depending on what your credit score currently is, these actions may have minimal impact on your life. If you are in the mid 700s or higher, your score is excellent, and closing these cards will likely not impact anything for you in a significant way. If you arent that high in your score yet, do you have an immediate need for a high score? Are you planning on getting more credit cards, or take out any more loans? I would suggest that, since you have credit card debt, you shouldnt be taking out any new loans until you get that cleaned up. So your score in the mean time is not very important. Are you currently working on eliminating this credit card debt? If so, your utilization number will improve, even after you close these accounts, when you get those paid off. Utilization has only a temporary effect on your score when your utilization improves, your score improves immediately. Your average account age may or may not improve when you close these accounts, depending on how old they are compared to the accounts you are leaving open. However, the impact of this might not be as much as you think. I realize that this advice is different from other answers, or other things that you may read online. But in my own life, I do a lot of things that are supposedly bad for the credit score I only have two credit cards, ages 2.5 and 1.5 years. I closed my other cards when I got these. My typical monthly utilization is around 25 on these cards, although I pay off the balance in full each month, never paying interest. I have no car loan anymore, and my mortgage is only 4 months old. No other debt. Despite those \"terrible\" credit practices, my credit score is very high. Conclusion Make your payments on time, get out of debt, and your score will be fine. Dont keep unwanted accounts open just because someone told you that you should."

    "body": "Congratulations for achieving an important step in the road to financial freedom. Some view extending loan payment of loans that allow the deduction of interest as a good thing. Some view the hit on the credit score by prematurely paying off an installment loan as a bad thing. Determining the order of paying off multiple loans in conjunction with the reality of income, required monthly living expense, and the need to save for emergencies is highly individualized. Keeping an artificial debt seems to make little sense, it is an expensive insurance policy to chase a diminishing tax benefit and boost to a credit score. Keep in mind it is a deduction, not a credit, so how much you save depends on your tax bracket. It might make sense for somebody to extend the loan out for an extra year or two, but you cant just assume that that advice applies in your situation. Personally I paid off my student loan early, as soon as it made sense based on my income, and my situation. I am glad I did, but for others the opposite made more sense."

Some of the businesses not permitted are liquor, wine, casinos, pornography, insurance, gambling, pork processing, and interestbased banks or finance associations.

If your employer offers it, see if you can do a Roth 401k, as odds are good youll be in a higher tax bracket at retirement than you are now and you will benefit from the Roth structure. Otherwise, use a regular 401k. IRAs are also an option, but you can put more money into a 401k than you can into an IRA. If you do this for a decade or two while youre young, youll be very well set on the road to retirement. Moreover, since you think \"Ive got the money, why not?\" this will actually keep the money from you so you can do a better job of avoiding that question. Your next concern will be posttax money. Youre going to be splitting this between three basic sorts of places just plain spending it, savinginvesting it in bank accounts and stock markets, or purchasing some other form of capital which will save you money or provide you with some useful capability thats worth money e.g. owning a condohouse will help you save on rent  and you dont have to pay income taxes on that savings! 18 is generally a little young to be setting down and buying a house, though, so you should probably look at saving money for a while instead. Open an account at Vanguard or a similar institution and buy some simple index funds. The index funds have lower turnover, which is probably better for your unsheltered accounts, and you dont need to spend a bunch of money on mutual fund expense ratios, or spend a lot of time making a second career out of stockpicking. If you save a lot of your money for retirement now, you wont have to save as much later, and will have more income to spend on a house, so itll all work out. Whatever you do, you shouldnt blow a bunch of money on a really fancy new car. You might consider a prettynice slightlyused car, but the first year of car ownership is distressingly close to just throwing your money away, and fancy cars only make it that much worse. You should also try to have some fun and interesting experiences while youre still young. Its okay to spend some money on them.

Mortgage companies are now forced to select appraisers essentially at random through 3rd party Appraisal Resource Companies ARCs. This randomization mandate from the government was issued in order to combat fraud, but it is really causing more trouble for homeowners because it took away appraiser accountability. Basically, theres nothing we can do to fire an appraiser anymore. Ive had appraiser do terrible jobs, just blatantly wrong, and have gone the distance with the dispute process only to find they wont change the value. My favorite reallife example came from an appraiser who got the bedroom count wrong 4 instead of 5 yet he took pictures of 5 bedrooms. The one he excluded he stated it shouldnt count because it didnt have a closet. Problem is, it DID have a closet. I had the homeowner take pictures of all of the closets in his house, and send them in. He still refused to change the count. After close to 2 months of the dispute process, the ARC came in and changed the count, but did not chagne the value, stating that the room count didnt increase the sqft, and there would be no adjustment in value. I was floored. The only solution we had was to wait for the appraisal to expire, then order it again which we did. The new appraiser got the count right, and surprisingly not really, it came in at the right value... In regards to the value necessary to avoid MI, they are likely using 80, but its not based on your current balance vs the value, its based on the new loan amount which will include costs, prepaids, skipped mortgage payments, etc vs the value. Here are your options Get a new appraisal. If you are confident the value is wrong, go somewhere else and get a new appraisal. Restructure the loan. Any competent Loan Officer would have noticed that you are very close to 80, and should have offer you the option of splitting the mortgage into a 1st and 2nd loan. Keeping the first loan at 80, and taking out a 2nd for the difference would avoid MI. Best Regards, Jared Newton"

    "body": "Debt is nominal, which means when inflation happens, the value of the money owed goes down. This is great for the borrower and bad for the lender. \"Investing\" can mean a lot of different things. Frequently it is used to describe buying common stock, which is an ownership claim on a company. A company is not a nominally fixed asset, by which I mean if there was a bunch of inflation and nothing else happened i.e., the inflation was not the cause or result of some other economic change then the nominal value of the company will go up along with the prices of other things. Based on the above, Id say you are incorrect to treat debt and investment returns the same way with respect to inflation. When we say equity returns 9, we mean it returns a real 7 plus 2 inflation or whatever. If the rate of inflation increased to 10 and nothing else happened in the economy, the same equity would be expected to return 17. In fact, the companys nominally fixed debts would be worth less, increasing the real value of the company at the expense of their debtholders. On the other hand, if we entered a period of high inflation, your debt liability would go way down and you would have benefited greatly from borrowing and investing at the same time. If you are expecting inflation in the abstract sense, then borrowing and investing in common stock is a great idea. Inflation is frequently the result or cause of a period of economic trouble, so please be aware that the above makes sense if we treat inflation as the only thing that changed. If inflation came about because OPEC makes oil crazy expensive, millennials just stop working, all of our factories got bombed to hades, or trade wars have shut down international commerce, then the value of stocks would most definitely be affected. In that case its not really \"inflation\" that affected the stock returns, though."

The leverage factor mentions the amount of leverage happening. 10000 yen being borrowed with an equity of 1000 yen. 2 Commercial banks 10 to 1  They dont deal in complicated investments, derivatives except for hedging, and are under stricter controls of the government. They have to have certain amount of liquidity and can loan out the rest for business. Investment banks 30 to 1  Their main idea is making money and trade heavily. Their deposits are limited by the amount clients have deposited. And as their main motive is to get maximum returns from the available amount, they trade heavily. Derivatives, one of the instruments, are structured on underlyings and sometimes in multiple layers which build up quite a bit of leverage. And all of the trades happen on margins. You dont invest 10k to buy 10k of a traded stock. You put in, maybe 500 to take up the position and borrow the rest of the amount per se. It improves liquidity in the markets and increases efficiency. Else you could do only with what you have. So these margins add up to the leverage the bank is taking on."

    "body": "A 401k plan will ask you to name a beneficiary who will receive the funds if you dont withdraw them all before death. Usually, a primary beneficiary and a secondary beneficiary is requested. If you dont specify a beneficiary, your estate is the beneficiary by default. Note that the name supplied to the 401k plan is who will get the money, and you cannot change this by bequeathing the money in your will. For example, if you neglected to change the beneficiary upon divorce, it is useless to say in your will that the money in the 401k plan goes to your new wife the 401k plan will give it to your exwife who still remains the beneficiary of your 401k Money in a 401k plan is what is called income with respect to a decedent IRD on which income tax is levied, and it is also is part of your estate and thus liable to be subject to estate tax. The latter is true even if the 401k plan assets are not mentioned anywhere in your will, and even if the assets got sent to your exwife which is not what you wanted to have happen. There are various estate tax exceptions for spouse beneficiaries no estate tax due now, but will be charged when the spouse passes away. With regard to income tax, the beneficiaries of a 401k plan similarly IRAs, 403b plans etc generally get to take the whole amount and pay the income tax themselves. Edit in response to littleadvs comments Each 401k plan is different, and some plans, especially the smaller ones, may prefer to distribute the 401k assets as a lump sum rather than allow the beneficiaries to withdraw the money over several years and pay income tax on the amount withdrawn each year. This is because there are far too many rules and regulations to trip over when making withdrawals over several years. The lump sum distribution can be transferred into a newly established Inherited IRA see the Nolo article linked to in littleadvs answer for some details and some pitfalls to avoid and the income tax is thus deferred until withdrawals occur. Spouse beneficiaries are entitled to more generous rules than nonspouse beneficiaries. If your heirs are otherwise well provided for and you are in a philanthropic mood or you dont want to give em a dime, the ungrateful... who never call, not even on Fathers Day!, one way of avoiding a lot of tax is to make the beneficiary of your 401k be one or more of your favorite charities. In fact, if your testamentary inclination is to make some charitable bequests as part of your will, it is much more advantageous to give money from a taxdeferred account to the charity size of estate is reduced, no income tax paid by anyone on amount given, and bequeath assets in nonretirement accounts to ones heirs bequests are not taxable income, and heirs get a step up in basis for assets that have appreciated rather than the other way around heirs pay income tax as they withdraw the money from taxdeferred account Estate planning is a complicated business, and you really should talk to a professional about such matters and not rely on advice from an Internet forum."

Removing an older account takes that account out of the equation of calculating your overall credit score, which can hurt significantly, especially if that is the only, or one of just a couple, of open credit lines you have available. Reducing your available credit will make your current debt look bigger than what it was before you closed your account. Going over a certain percentage for your debt to available credit can make you look less favorable to lenders. [As stated above, closing a credit card does remove it from the credit utilization calculation which can raise your debtcredit ratio. It does not, however affect the average age of credit cards. Even closed accounts stay on your credit report for ten years and are credited toward average age of cards. When the closed credit card falls off your report, only then, will the average age of credit cards be recalculated.] And may I suggest getting your free credit report from httpswww.annualcreditreport.com . Its the only place considered official to receive your free annual credit report as told by the FTC.

EDIT To answer your second point, there are numerous factors that banks and creditors will consider depending on the type of card youre applying for. The heavier the personal rewards cash back, flyer miles, discounts, etc. the bigger the stipulation. Some factors to consider are your income to debt ratio, income to available credit ratio, number of revolving lines of credit, debt to available credit ratio, available credit to debt ratio, and whether or not you have sufficient equity andor assets to cover both your debt and available credit.

    "body": "Unfortunately it is not possible for an ordinary person to become an accredited investor without a career change. Gaining any legal certification in investments typically require sponsorship from an investment company which you would be working for. There are reasons why these kinds of investments are not available to ordinary people directly, and you should definitely consult an RIA registered investment adviser before investing in something that isnt extremely standardized traded on an major exchange. The issue with these kinds of investments is that they are not particularly standardized in terms of legal structuresettlement terms. Registered investment advisers and other people who manage investments professionally are theoretically given specific training to understand these kinds of nonstandard investments and are theoretically qualified to analyze the legal documentation of these, make well informed investment decisions, and make sure that their investors are not falling into any kind of pyramid scheme. There are many many kinds of issues that can arise when investing in startups. What  of the company the companys profits are you entitled to? How long can the company go without paying you a dividend? Do they have to pay you a dividend at all? How liquid will your investment in the company be? Unfortunately it is common for startups to accept investment but have legal restrictions on their investors ability to sell their stake in the business, and other nonstandard contract clauses. For example, some investment agreements have a clause which states that you can only sell your stake in the business to a person who already owns a stake in the business. This makes your investment essentially worthless  the company could run for an exponential amount of time without paying you a dividend. If you are not able to sell your stake in the company you will not be able to earn any capital gains either. The probability of a startup eventually going public is extremely small.. so in this scenario it is likely you will end up gaining no return investment though you can be happy to know you helped a company grow! Overall, the restrictions for these kinds of investments exist to protect ordinary folks from making investing their savings into things that could get them burned. If you want to invest in companies on FundersClub build a relationship with an RIA and work with that person to invest your money. It is easier, less risky, and not all that more expensive "

Suppose my company issued 10 shares to you for your help in the organization. Now you need money and you want to sell it. You can offer it at any price you want to to the buyer. If the buyer accepts your offer thats the price you get. So the price of the share is determined by the price a buyer is willing to buy it at from you. Remember the Face value of the shares remains the same no matter what price you sell it for. Now annual profit distribution is again something called dividends. Suppose my company has 100 shares in total out of which I have given you 10. This means you are a 10 owner of the company and you will be entitled to 10 of the net profit the company makes. Now at the end of the year suppose my company makes a 12,000 USD net profit. Now a panel called board of directors which is appointed by share holders will decide on how much profit to keep within the company for future business and how much to distribute about share holders. Suppose they decide to keep 2000 and distribute 10,000 out of total profit. Since you own 10 shares of the company you get 1000. The softwares you are talking are accounting softwares. You can do everything with those softwares. Afterall a company is only about profit and loss statements."

    "body": "Okay, I think I managed to find the precise answer to this problem! It involves solving a nonlinear exponential equation, but I also found a good approximate solution using the truncated Taylor series. See below for a spreadsheet you can use. Lets start by defining the growth factors per period, for money in the bank and money invested Now, let S be the amount ready to be invested after n1 periods so the first of that money has earned interest for n periods. That is, The key step to solve the problem was to fix the total number of periods considered. So lets introduce a new variable t  the total number of time periods elapsed So if money is ready to invest every n1 periods, there will be tn1 separate investments, and the future value of the investments will be This formula is exact in the case of integer t and n, and a good approximation when t and n are not integers. Substituting S, we get the version of the formula which explicitly depends on n Fortunately, only a couple of terms in FV depend on n, so we can find the derivative after some effort Equating the derivative to zero, we can remove the denominator, and assuming t is greater than zero, we can divide by the constant  1G t  To simplify the equation, we can define some extra constants Then, we can define a function fn and write the equation as Note that , , , G, and R are all constant. From here there are two options Use Newtons method or another numerical method for finding the positive root of fn. This can be done in a number of software packages like MATLAB, Octave, etc, or by using a graphics calculator. Solve approximately using a truncated Taylor series polynomial. I will use this method here. The Taylor series of fn, centred around n0, is Truncating the series to the first three terms, we get a quadratic polynomial with constant coefficients Using R, G, ,  and  defined above, let c0, c1 and c2 be the coefficients of the truncated Taylor series for fn Then, n should be rounded to the nearest whole number. To be certain, check the values above and below n using the formula for FV. Using the example from the question For example, I might put aside 100 every week to invest into a stock with an expected growth of 9 p.a., but brokerage fees are 10trade. For how many weeks should I accumulate the 100 before investing, if I can put it in my highinterest bank account at 4 p.a. until then? Using Newtons method to find roots of fn above, we get n  14.004. Using the closedform approximate solution, we get n  14.082. Checking this against the FV with t  1680 evenly divisible by each n  1 tested Therefore, you should wait for n  14 periods, keeping that money in the bank, investing it together with the money in the next period so you will make an investment every 14  1  15 weeks. Heres one way to implement the above solution with a spreadsheet. StackExchange doesnt allow tables in their syntax at this time, so Ill show a screenshot of the formulae and columns you can copy and paste Formulae Copy and paste column A Copy and paste column B Results Remember, n is the number of periods to accumulate money in the bank. So you will want to invest every n1 weeks in this case, every 15 weeks."

    "body": "All of the provided advice is great, but a slightly different viewpoint on debt is worth mentioning. Here are the areas that you should concentrate your efforts and the rough order you should proceed. Much of the following is predicated upon your having a situation where you need to get out of debt, and learn to better budget and control your spending. You may already have accomplished some of these steps, or you may prioritize differently. Many people advise prioritizing contributing to a 401k savings plan. But with the assumption that you need advise because you have debt trouble, you are probably paying absurd interest rates, and any savings you might have will be earning much lower rates than you are paying on consumer debt. If you are already contributing, continue the plan. But remember, you are looking for advice because your financial situation is in trouble, so you need to put out the fire your present problem, and learn how to manage your money and plan for the future. Compose a budget, comprised of the following three areas the exact percentages are fungible, fit them to your circumstances. Here is where planning can get fun, when you have freed yourself from debt, and you can make choices that resonate with your individual goals. Once you have \"put out the fire\" of debt, then you should do two things at the same time. As you pay off debt and avoid further debt, you will find that saving for both independence and retirement become easier. The average American household may have 8000 credit card debt, and at 2030, the interest payments are 150200month, and the average car payment is nearly 500month. Eliminate debt and you will have 500800month that you can comfortably allocate towards retirement. But you also need to learn educate yourself how to invest your money to grow your money, and earn income from your savings. This is an area where many struggle, because we are taught to save, but we are not taught how to invest, choose investments wisely and carefully, and how to decide our goals. Investing needs to be addressed separately, but you need to learn how. Live in an affordable house, and pay off your mortgage. Consider that the payment on a mortgage on even a modest 200K house is over 1000month. Combine saving the money you would have paid towards a mortgage payment with the money you would have paid towards credit card debt or a car loan. Saving becomes easy when you are freed from these large debts."

    "header": "What optionrelated strategies are better suited to increasing return potential?",
    "body": "I think you need to be very careful here. Covered calls dont reduce risk or increase performance overall. If they did, every investment manager would be using them. In a typical portfolio, over the long term, the gains you give up when your stock goes beyond the strike of your calls will negate the premiums you receive over time. Psychologically, covered calls are appealing because your gains happen over a long period and this is why many people suggest it. But if you believe the BlackScholes model used for pricing options this is what the model predicts over the long term  that you wont do any better than just holding stock unless you have some edge other traders dont. Now you say you want to reduce diversification and raise your risk. Keeping in mind that there is no free lunch, there are several ways to reduce your risk but they all come at a price. For simplicity, there are three elements to consider  risk, potential gain and cash. These are tradeoffs and you cant simultaneously make them all favorable. You must trade one or more of them to gain in the others. Lets say you wanted to concentrate into a few stocks... how could you counteract the additional risk? 1 Covered calls very popular strategy usually intended erroneously for increasing returns. You get the bonus of cash along with marginally less risk. But you give up a substantial amount of potential return. You wont have blowout returns if you do this. You still face substantial risk. 2 Collar your stock You sell a covered call while using the cash from the sale to buy puts for protection. You give up potential gains, youre neutral on cash but gain significantly on reducing risk. 3 Use calls as proxy for stock You dont hold stock but only calls in equivalent delta to the stock you would have held. Substantially lower risk while still having potential gain. Your tradeoff is the cash you have to pay for the calls. When using this, one must be very, very careful not to overleverage. 4 Puts as protection for stocks This is basically the same as 3 in tradeoffs. You wont overleverage and you also get dividends. But for the most part its the same. These are the main ways to reduce the risk you gain by concentrating. Options themselves are far broader. But keep in mind that there is no free money. All these techniques involve tradeoffs that you have to be aware of."

    "header": "Is stock trading based more on luck than poker playing? ",
    "body": "This depends strongly on what you mean by \"stock trading\". It isnt a single game, but a huge number of games grouped under a single name. You can invest in individual stocks. If youre willing to make the large effort needed to research the companies and their current position and potentialities, this can yield large returns at high risk, or moderate returns at moderate risk. You need to diversify across multiple stocks, and multiple kinds of stocks and probably bonds and other investment vehicles as well to manage that risk. Or you can invest in managed mutual funds, where someone picks and balances the stocks for you. They charge a fee for that service, which has to be subtracted from their stated returns. You need to decide how much you trust them. You will usually need to diversify across multiple funds to get the balance of risk youre looking for, with a few exceptions like Target Date funds. Or you can invest in index funds, which automate the stockpicking process to take a wide view of the market and count on the fact that, over time, the market as a whole moves upward. These may not produce the same returns on paper, but their fees are MUCH lower  enough so that the actual returns to the investor can be as good as, or better than, managed funds. The same point about diversification remains true, with the same exceptions. Or you can invest in a mixture of these, plus bonds and other investment vehicles, to suit your own level of confidence in your abilities, confidence in the market as a whole, risk tolerance, and so on. Having said all that, theres also a huge difference between \"trading\" and \"investing\", at least as I use the terms. Stock trading on a shortterm basis is much closer to pure gambling  unless you do the work to deeply research the stocks in question so you know their value better than other people do, and youre playing against pros. You know the rule about poker If you look around the table and dont see the sucker, hes sitting in your seat... well, thats true to some degree in shortterm trading too. This isnt quite a zerosum game, but it takes more work to play well than I consider worth the effort. Investing for the long term  defining a balanced mixture of investments and maintaining that mixture for years, with purchases and sales chosen to keep things balanced  is a positive sum game, since the market does drift upward over time at a longterm average of about 8year. If youre sufficiently diversified which is one reason I like index funds, youre basically riding that rise. This puts you in the position of betting with the pros rather than against them, which is a lowerrisk position. Of course the potential returns are reduced too, but Ive found that \"market rate of return\" has been entirely adequate, though not exciting. Of course theres risk here too, if the market dips for some reason, such as the \"great recession\" we just went through  but if youre planning for the long term you can usually ride out such dips, and perhaps even see them as opportunities to buy at a discount. Others can tell you more about the details of each of these, and may disagree with my characterizations ... but thats the approach Ive taken, based on advice I trust. I could probably increase my returns if I was willing to invest more time and effort in doing so, but I dont especially like playing games for money, and Im getting quite enough for my purposes and spending nearzero effort on it, which is exactly what I want."

    "body": "TLDR  my understanding of the rules is that if you are required to register for GST earning more than 75k per annum, you would be required to pay GST on these items. To clarify firstly taxable income, and goods and services tax, are two different things. Any income you receive needs to be considered for income tax purposes  whether or not it ends up being taxable income would be too much to go into here, but generally you would take your expenses, and any deductions, away from your income to arrive at what would generally be the taxable amount. An accountant will help you do this. Income tax is paid by anyone who earns income over the tax free threshold. By contrast, goods and services tax is a tax paid by business of which you are running one. Of course, this is passed on to the consumer, but its the business that remits the payment to the tax office. However, GST isnt required to be charged and paid in all cases The key in your situation is first determining whether you need to register for GST or whether indeed you already have. If you earn less than 75,000 per year  no need to register. If you do earn more than that through your business, or you have registered anyway, then the next question is whether your items are GSTfree. The ATO says that \"some education courses [and] course materials\" are GSTfree. Whether this applies to you or not Im obviously not going to be able to comment on, so I would advise getting an accountants advice on this or at the very least, call the ATO or browse their legal database. Thirdly, are your sales connected with Australia? The ATO says that \"A sale of something other than goods or property is connected with Australia if ... the thing is done in Australia [or] the seller makes the sale through a business they carry on in Australia\". Both of these appear to be true in your case. So in summary if you are required to register for GST, you would be required to pay GST on these items.

    "body": "Yes, they are, and youve experienced why. Generally speaking, stocks that pay dividends will be better investments than stocks that dont. Heres why 1 Theyre actually making money. They can finagle balance sheets and news releases, but cash is cash, it tells no lies. They cant fake it. 2 Theres less good they can do with that money than they say. When a business you own is making money, they can do two things with it reinvest it into the company, or hand it over to you. All companies must reinvest to some degree, but only a few companies worth owning can find profitable ways of reinvesting all of it. Having to hand you, the owner, some of the earnings helps keep that money from leaking away on such \"necessities\" like corporate jets, expensive printer paper, or illconceived corporate buyouts. 3 It helps you not freak out. Markets go up, and markets go down. If you own a good company thats giving you a nice check every three months, its a lot easier to not panic sell in a downturn. After all, theyre handing you a nice check every three months, and checks are cash, and cash tells no lies. You know theyre still a good company, and you can ride it out. 4 It helps others not freak out. See 3. That applies to everyone. That, in turn means market downturns weigh less heavily on companies paying solid dividends than on those that do not. 5 It gives you some of the reward of investing in good companies, without having to sell those companies. If youve got a piece of a good, solid, profitable, growing company, why on earth would you want to sell it? But youd like to see some rewards from making that wise investment, wouldnt you? 6 Dividends can grow. Solid, growing companies produce more and more earnings. Which means they can hand you more and more cash via the dividend. Which means that if, say, they reliably raise dividends 10year, that measly 3 dividend turns into a 6 dividend seven years later on your initial investment. At year 14, its 12. Year 21, 24. See where this is going? Companies like that do exist, google \"Dividend Aristocrats\". 7 Dividends make growth less important. If you owned a company that paid you a 10 dividend every year, but never grew an inch, would you care? How about 5, and it grows only slowly? You invest in companies, not dividends. You invest in companies to make money. Dividends are a useful tool when you invest  to gauge company value, to smooth your ride, and to give you some of the profit of the business you own. They are, however, only part of the total return from investing  as you found out."

Different lenders will have different rules about what they do and dont accept as incomes these rules may even vary perproduct within the same lenders product list. So for example a mortgage specifically offered as buytolet might accept rental income with a suitable voidperiod multiplier into consideration, but an owneroccupier mortgage product might not. Similarly, business rules will vary about acceptance of regular overtime, bonuses, and so on. Guessing at specific answers 1 maybe, if its a buytolet product, Note that these generally carry a higher interest rate than owneroccupier mortgages expect about 2 more 2 in my opinion its extremely unlikely that any lender would consider rental income from your cohabiting spouse 3 probably yes, if its a buytolet product"

If you want to divide it any other way, you will have to agree what an appropriate division is. Dividing according to the amount each of you paid towards it is a good way. Decide for yourselves if that means just mortgage payments, or also taxes, repairs, utilities etc. You should also be aware that if you have been living together a long time, like more than a year, some jurisdictions will allow one party to sue the other as if they were getting divorced.

    "body": "Fidelity has a good explanation of Restricted Stock Awards For grants that pay in actual shares, the employees tax holding period begins at the time of vesting, and the employees tax basis is equal to the amount paid for the stock plus the amount included as ordinary compensation income. Upon a later sale of the shares, assuming the employee holds the shares as a capital asset, the employee would recognize capital gain income or loss whether such capital gain would be a short or longterm gain would depend on the time between the beginning of the holding period at vesting and the date of the subsequent sale. Consult your tax adviser regarding the income tax consequences to you. So, you would count from vesting for longterm capital gains purposes. Also note the point to include the amount of income you were considered to have earned as a result of the original vesting [market value then  amount you paid]. And of course, you reported that as income in 20152016, right? So if you had 300 shares of Stock ABC granted you in 2014 for a price of 5share, and in 2015 100 of those shares vested at FMV 8share, and in 2016 100 of those shares vested, current FMV 10share, you had 300 in income in 2015 and 500 of income in 2016 from this.

It pays to keep an eye on the financial statements of the company to check how much liquid money they might be carrying around to pay shareholders as dividends. They can stop paying dividends whenever they want. Apple didnt pay a dividend while Steve Jobs was around, even though they were making billions in profits. Many companies dont pay dividends because they find it more beneficial to continue investing in their business rather than returning money to shareholders."

Although I do not have any books or videos to suggest to you at the moment, I will do some more research and edit this answer.

It mostly uses the prior year currently 2016 as the basis, but it does have the updated 2017 figures for items that are automatically adjusted for inflation bracket points and thus filing threshhold, standard deductions, Social Security cap, and maybe another one or two I missed. The forms making up the actual return cannot be prepared very far in advance because, as commented, Congress frequently makes changes to tax law well after the year begins, and in some cases right up to Dec. 31. The IRS must start preparing forms and pubs  and equally important, setting the specifications for software providers like Intuit TurboTax and HRBlock  several months ahead in order to not seriously delay filing season, and with it refunds, which nearly everyone in the country considers at least publicly to be worse than World War Three and the destruction of the Earth by rogue asteroids. I have 1040 series from the last 4 years still on my computer, and the download dates mostly range from late September to mid January. Although one outlier shows the range of possibility 2013 form 1040 and Schedule A were tweaked in April 2014 because Congress passed a law allowing charitable contributions for Typhoon Haiyan to be deducted in the prior year. Substantive, but relatively minor, changes happen every year, including many that keep recurring like the special preAGI teacher supplies deduction \"will they or wont they?\", section 179 expensing changes slightly almost every year, and formerly the IRAdirecttocharity option finally made permanent last year. As commented, the current Congress and President were elected on a platform with tax reform as an important element, and they are talking even more intensely than before about doing it, although whether they will actually do anything this year is still uncertain. However, if major reform is done it will almost certainly apply to future years only, and likely only start after a lag of some months to a year. They know it causes chaos for businesses and households alike to upend without advance warning the assumptions built in to current budgets and plans  and IME as a political matter something that is enacted now and effective fairly soon but not now is just as good but I think that part is offtopic."

Here is the essential problem with credit cards. Everyone sets out with good intentions, to use the credit card like a debit card, and pay charges off before interest accrues. However, almost noone has the discipline to remember to do this, and a balance quickly builds up on the card. Also, its extremely easy to prioritize other bill payments before credit card payments, resulting in a balance building up on the card. Its almost magical how quickly a balance will build up on a credit card. Ultimately, they are simply too convenient, too tempting for most human beings. The world, and especially the North American world, is in a massive debt crisis. It is very easy to borrow money these days, and our culture is at the point where \"buy now pay later\" is an accepted practice.

We dont like it when things suck. So when finding out that you are being ripped off every day of your life, your reaction is \"There must be a logical reason that perfectly explain why this is. After all, the world is fair, governments are working in our best interest and if they do it this way, they must have a very good reason for it.\" Sorry, but that not the case. You have the facts. You are just not looking at them. Economics, as a subject, is the proper management of resources and production. Now, forget the fancy theories, the elaborate nonsense about stocks and bonds and currencies and pay attention to the actual situation. On our planet, most people earn 2,000 per year. Clean water is not available for a very sizable percent of the worlds population. Admittedly, 90 of the worlds wealth is concentrated in the hands of the most wealthy 10. A Chinese engineer earns a fraction of what a similarly qualified engineer earns in the States. Most people, even in rich countries, have a negative net value. They have mortgages that run for a third of their lifetimes, credit card debts, loans... do the balance. Most people are broke. Does this strike you as the logical result of a fair and balanced economic system? Does this look like a random happenstance? The dominant theory is \"It just happened, its nobodys fault and nobody designed it that way and to think otherwise is very bad because it makes you a conspiracy theorist, and conspiracy theorists are nuts. You are not nuts are you?\" Look at the facts already in your possession. It didnt just happen. The system is rigged. When a suit typing a few numbers in a computer can make more money in 5 minutes than an average Joe can make in 100 lifetimes of honest, productive work, you dont have a fair economic system, you have a scam machine. When you look at a system as broken as the one we have, you shouldnt be asking yourself \"what makes this system right?\" What you should be asking yourself is more along the lines of \"Why is it broken? Who benefits? Why did congress turn its monetary policy over to the Federal reserve a group of unelected and unaccountable individuals with strong ties in the banking industry and does not even bother to conduct audits to know how your money is actually managed? This brilliant movie, Money as debt, points to a number of outrageous bugs in our economic system. Now, you can dream up reasons why the system should be the way it is and why it is an acceptable system. Or you can look at the fact and realize that there is NO JUSTIFICATION for an economic system that perform as badly as it does. Back to basics. Money is supposed to represent production. Its in every basic textbook on the subject of economics. So, what should money creation be based on? Debt? No. Gold? No. Randomly printed by the government when they feel like it? No although this could actually be better than the 2 previous suggestions Money is supposed to represent production. Index money on production and you have a sound system. Why isnt it done that way?

However, over the years, as the Target Fund changes its mix, withdrawing money from the stock mutual funds and investing the proceeds into bond mutual funds, you do not have to pay taxes on the profits generated by these transactions except insofar as some part of the profits become distributions from the Target Fund itself.

Id start with this PDF file from the FTC and then start googling for info on your states regulations. Also it would be a very very good idea to review the documents you signed or get a copy when you took out the loan to see what sort of additional penalties etc you may have already agreed to in the event you default. The fees the collector is adding in could be of their own creation making them highly negotiable, or it might be something you already agreed to in advanceleaving you little recourse but to pay them. Do keep in mind that in many cases debt collectors are ausually llowed at the very least to charge you simple interest of around 10. On a debt of your size, paid off over several years, that might amount to more than the 4K they are adding. OTOH you can pretty much expect them to try both, tacking on fees and then trying to add interest if the fees are not paid. Another source of assistance may be the Department of Education Ombudsman If you need help with a defaulted student loan, contact the Department of Educations Ombudsman at 8775572575 or visit its website at www.fsahelp.ed.gov.

    "body": "If you plan to keep this asset for ten years then you can take the deprecation of its cost over that time period. For simplicity lets treat that as 120 monthly payments. So at a purchase price of 60,000 you are committing around 500 per month not including vehicle maintenance. I typically allocate around 20 percent of the purchase price of my vehicles for future maintenance costs. Since you have the cash to purchase this outright you have an option not afforded to most people. This adds for additional consideration. Here is an example. You purchase a 60,000 car and put 10,000 down. You finance 50,000 at 2.84 over 60 months. Your total finance cost is 53,693 if you do not miss any payments. The question here is can you make more than 3,693 on the 50,000 that you would retain in this situation over a five year period? I know that I most certainly can and is an excellent example of why I finance my vehicles. Obviously this all goes out the window if you do not have the credit for top rates. I have also negotiated a vehicle maintenance plan with the dealership at the time of my vehicle purchases. Most dealerships offer this service, the key here is negotiating. On my last truck I was able to get an all inclusive maintenance policy for 72 months for 8 of the purchase price. Your mileage will vary with manufacturer and dealership. As described in the comments above it is never beneficial for an individual to lease. You end up paying more for the newer models.

    "body": "Careful. I would personally need a LOT more than 5 more per hour to go from W2 employment to 1099 employment. It boils down to two reasons 1 employers pay a huge amount of taxes on behalf of their employees, and 2 you would have to pay all of your own withholding up front. Your current proposal from them doesnt account for that. There are also risks that you face as a 1099. On the first item, your employer currently pays 6.2 of your Social Security tax. You pay the other 6.2. If you go to 1099 status, you will be selfemployed as an independent contractor and have to pay the full 12.4 out of your increased 1099 wages. On the second item, your employer also does your withholding out of your paychecks based on what you tell them on a form W4. If youre disciplined enough to pay this out yourself in estimated taxes every time you get a paycheck, great. Many people arent and just see a much bigger paycheck with no taxes out of it, and end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year. Overall, there are some other considerations like healthcare and other benefits. These will not be available to you as a 1099 employee.

I know you mentioned your area requires you to be 19, not sure if that still applies if you are applying online, in another state.

In my lifetime, it has been as high as 1,000,000 and as low as 100,000. I attached a link, which is updated by FDIC. In the case of fraud It depends. If you read this story and are horrified I was too, you know that the banking system is not as safe as the other answers imply In February 2005, Joe Lopez, a businessman from Florida, filed a suit against Bank of America after unknown hackers stole 90,000 from his Bank of America account. The money had been transferred to Latvia. An investigation showed that Mr. Lopezs computer was infected with a malicious program, Backdoor.Coreflood, which records every keystroke and sends this information to malicious users via the Internet. This is how the hackers got hold of Joe Lopezs user name and password, since Mr. Lopez often used the Internet to manage his Bank of America account. However the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff, saying that Mr. Lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his bank account on the Internet a signature for the malicious code that was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product databases back in 2003. Ouch. But lets think about the story for a second  he had his money stolen because of online banking and he didnt have the latest antivirusantimalware software. How safe is banking if you dont do online banking? In the case of this story, it would have prevented keyloggers, but youre still susceptible to someone stealing your card or account information. So In the banks defense, how does a bank not know that someone didnt wire money to a friend which is a loss for good, then get some of that money back from his friend while also getting money back from the bank, which had to face the loss. Yes, it sucks, but its not total madness. As for disputing charges, from personal experience it also depends. I dont use cards whatsoever, so Ive never had to worry, but both of my parents have experienced banking fraud where a fake charge on their card was not reversed. Neither of my parents are rich and cant afford lawyers, so crying \"lawsuit\" is not an option for everyone. How often does this occur? I suspect its rare that banks dont reverse the charges in fraudulent cases, though you will still lose time for filing and possibly filling out paperwork. The way to prevent this As much as I hate to be the bearer of bad news, there is no absolutely safe place to keep your money. Even if you bought metals and buried them in the ground, a drifter with a metal detector might run across it one day. You can take steps to protect yourself, but there is no absolute guarantee that these will work out. Account Closures I added this today because I saw this question and have only seenheard about this three times. Provided that you get the cashiers check back safely, you should be okay  but why was this persons account closed and look at how much funds he had! From his question In the two years I banked with BoA I never had an overdraft or any negative marks on my account so the only thing that would stick out was a check that I deposited for 26k that my mom left me after she passed. Naturally, people arent going to like some of my answers, especially this, but imagine youre in an immediate need for cash, and you experience this issue. What can you do? Lets say that rent is on the line and its 25 for every day that youre late. Other steps to protect yourself Some banks allow you to use a keyword or phrase. If youre careful with how you do this and are clever, it will reduce the risk that someone steals your money."

    "body": "A falling exchange rate is an indication of falling confidence in a currency. Countries like Iran or Venezuela, with a managed exchange rate, set their exchange rates at a higher value than the market accepts. Such market expectations may be influenced by poor government management, interventions into markets such as nationalising businesses or general instability  scarcity. The governments act to manage that uncertainty by limiting the availability of foreign exchange and pegging the exchange rate. Since there is an inadequate supply of trusted foreign currency people turn to informal exchanges in order to hedge their currency risk. This creates a negative feedback loop. People in government who have access to foreign exchange start to trade on informal markets, pocketing the difference in the official and unofficial rates. The increasing gap between the two rates drives increasing informal market exchange and can result in speculative bubbles. Driving instability or economic contradiction is that the massive and increasing difference between the official and market exchange rates becomes a powerful form of rent for government officials. This drives further stateled rentseeking behaviour and causes the economy to become even more unstable. If youre interested in a more formal academic study of how such parallel markets in currency arise, \"Zimbabwes Black Market for Foreign Exchange\" by Albert Makochekanwa at the University of Pretoria is a useful source."

That means that in 20 years from now, a company might sell more and make more profits, but because there are less investors on the market it will worth less judging by supply and demand this has to be true. Doesnt that seem like a disconnect to you guys? Doesnt that just prove that all those profits are not really yours, but instead youre just sitting on the side making bets about them? If I own a company from the point where it goes public and while the value goes up I hold on to it for 50 years. Lets say for 45 years it made tons of profits but never paid a cent in dividend, and then in 5 years it goes out of business. What happened to all the profits they made throughout the 45 years? If you owned a restaurant that made a profit for 45 years and then went bankrupt you are fine, you took your profits every year because why on earth would you reinvest 100 of the profit forever? But what if you could sell 49.9 of that restaurant on the stock market, get all of that IPO money and still keep all of the profits while claiming that you reinvest it forever? Thats exactly what they do! They just buy expensive things for personal use, from fancy cars to private jets, they just write it down as an investment and you cant see what the money was spent on because you are not a majority stakeholder, you have no power. It was not like this forever, companies used to pay all of their profits in dividends and be valued according to that. Not anymore.

    "body": "I dont think user4358s explanation is correct. A trailing LIT Sell Order adjusts downwards, i.e. if you place the order with an Aux price in TWS its trigger price of 105.00 and a trailing amount of 6.00 then, assuming the ask is 100.00, TWS will add the trailing amount to the ask price and if its less than the trigger price it will adjust. So in my example, if the market ask goes straight up to 105.00, nothing will be adjusted, the trigger is touched and the limit order will be placed see below. If on the the other hand the market goes down to 99.00 then trlng amt  ask is 105.00, if it goes further down to 98.00 then the trigger price will be adjusted to 104.00 because its less than the current trigger, and so on. For the LIT part you have either an absolute limit price you can enter, or you have an offset limit which will be subtracted from the trigger price, in which case it is adjusted as well. So back to my example, the trigger is now 104.00 and the limit offset is say 1.00, so my limit order would be placed at 103.00 if the ask ever touches 104.00, and that in turn is only visible if the bid touches 103.00 because its limitiftouched. For a buy just use the same explanation with some swapped roles, the trigger price adjust upwards when the trailing amount plus bid is larger than the current trigger, and the limit offset will be added to the trigger price. Edit Also quite succinct and worth having a look at httpwww.interactivebrokers.comentradingorderstrailingLimitTouched.php Guesswork, highly subjective As for why this might be good, well, you have to believe in momentum strategies, i.e. a market that goes down, will continue to go down, if you believe that and you believe in mean reversion as well, then a trailing limit order can assist you in not buyingselling impulsively, but closer to the mean. Ive never used it that way though. What I have done, even just now to get the explanation right, is to place trailing buy and sell orders simultaneously. You will find that you can just go in with coarse estimates and because the adjustments will go towards each other, you will end up with a narrowing band of trigger prices as opposed to trailing stop orders which will give you a widening band of trigger prices. If you believe in overshooting and equilibria then this can be one easy way to profit from it. Ive just sold EURUSD for 1.26420 and bought it back at 1.26380 with a trailing amount of 5pips and a limit offset of 2pips within the time of writing this."

In that case I think paying down a mortgage certainly is an investment one with a welldefined interest rate and maturity that depends on the precise terms of the mortgage. For example I have a UK mortgage thats fixed for the next two years at about 5, and allows overpayments of 500 per month, which can be withdrawn at any time. So I treat those overpayments as equivalent to savings with quite a nice interest rate, especially since mortgage interest isnt tax deductible and so I actually get the full benefit of that interest rate."

Heres a few cases where I can see an argument against large institutional investors In recent years, weve seen corporate raiders and institutional investors that tend to influence management in ways that are focused on short term gain. Theyll often go for board seats and disrupt the existing management team. It can serve as a distraction and really hurt morale. Institutional investors also have rules in their prospectus that they are required to abide by. For example, some institutional investors will not hold on to stock below 5. This really affected major banking stocks, some of which ended up doing reverse stock splits to keep their share price high. Institutional investors will also setup specific funds that require a stock to be listed as part of an index i.e. the SPY, DJIA etc.,. When a stock is removed from an index, big investors leave quickly and the share price suffers. In recent months, companies like Apple have made their share price more affordable to attract retail investors. It gives an opportunity for retail to feel even more connected to the company. Im not sure how much this affects overall sales... Generally, a good stock should be able to attract both retail and institutional investors.

    "body": "As your financial situation becomes more complex, it becomes increasingly more difficult to keep track of everything with a simple spreadsheet. It is much easier to work with software that is specifically designed for personal finances. A good program will allow you to keep track of as many accounts as you want. A great program will completely separate the different account balances location of the money from the budget category balances purpose of the money. Let me explain When you set up the software, you will enter in all of your different bank accounts with their balances. Perhaps you have three savings accounts and two checking accounts. It doesnt matter. When you are done entering those, the software will total them up, and the next job you have is assigning this money into different budget categories your spending plan. For example, you might put some of it into a grocery category, some into an entertainment category, some will be assigned to pay your next car insurance bill, and some will be an emergency fund. These categories are completely customizable, and your budget can be as broad or as detailed as you wish. When you deposit your paycheck, you assign that new income into budget categories as well. It doesnt matter at this point which accounts your money are located in the only thing that matters is that you own this money and you have access to it. Now, you might want to use a certain account for a certain budget category, but you are not required to do so. For example, your grocery category money will probably be in your checking account, since you will be spending from it regularly. Your emergency fund will hopefully be in an account that earns a little higher interest. Once you take this approach, you might find you dont need as many bank accounts as you thought you did, because the software does the job of separating your money into different \"accounts\" for different purposes. Ive written before about the different categories of personal finance software. YNAB, Mvelopes, and EveryDollar are three examples of software that will take this approach of separating the concepts of the bank account and the budget category."

    "body": "Presumably you need a car to get to work, so lets start with the assumption that you need to buy something to replace the car you just lost. The biggest difficulty to overcome in buying a car is the concept of the monthly payment. Dealers will play games with all of the numbers to massage a monthly payment that the buyer can swallow, but this usually doesnt end up giving the customer the best deal. The 18 month term is not normal for a lease, typically youll see 24 or 36 months. You are focusing on another goal of paying your student loans by then which would free up much more money for other wants like a car but at what cost? The big difficulty of personal finance is the mental mind game of delaying gratification for greater longterm benefit. You are focusing on paying your student loans now so that you can be free of that debt and have more flexibility for the future. Good. Youre tempted to spend another 5400 assuming no downpayment or other surprise fees to drive a car for 18 months. That doesnt sound any wiser than 5,000 for an unreliable used car that gave you more problems than you bargained for. Presumably you got some percentage of that money back from the insurance company when the car was totaled, but even if not, the real lesson should be finding a car that you can afford upfront, but also one that you can still use when the loan is paid off like your educationthat investment will keep giving even when the loans are a distant memory. My advice would be to look for a car that has about 30k miles on it and pay for it as quickly as possible, then drive it at least for 70120k more miles before replacing it. You may wish for a newer car, especially in 3 or 4 more years when it starts to show its age, but youll also thank yourself when you can buy a newer better car with cash and break out of the monthly payment game that dealers try to push on you. You might even enjoy negotiating with car salesmen when you see through their manipulations and simply work for the best cash price you can get."

For example, Schwab charges no commission on ETF purchases, but this is not an advantage if you wont buy ETFs. Consider minimums. Different brokers have different minimum cash balancedeposit requirements, so make sure you can meet those. Its true that you can get real time quotes anywhere, but consider the other services. For example, TD Ameritrade pools research reports for many publicly traded companies which are nice to read about what analysts have to say. Different brokers given different research tools, so read about offerings and see whats most useful to you. You can open different brokerage accounts, but its much more convenient to have a onestop place where you can do all you trading.

    "body": "To follow up on Quids comment, the share classes themselves will define what level of dividends are expected. Note that the terms common shares and preferred shares are generally understood terms, but are not as precise as you might believe. There are dozenshundreds of different characteristics that could be written into share classes in the companys articles of incorporation [as long as those characteristics are legal in corporate law in the companys jurisdiction]. So in answering your question theres a bit of an assumption that things are working as usual. Note that private companies often have odd quirks to their share classes, things like weird small classes of shares that have most of the voting rights, or shares with shotgun buyback clauses. As long as they are legal clauses, they can be used to help control how the business is run between various shareholders with competing interests. Things like parents anticipating future family infighting and trying to prevent familial struggle. You are unlikely to see such weird quirks in public companies, where the company will have additional regulatory requirements and where the public wont want any shock at unexpected share clauses. In your case, you suggested having a noncumulative preferred share [with no voting rights, but that doesnt impact dividend payment] There are two salient points left related to payout that the articles of incorporation will need to define for the share classes 1 What is the redemption value for the shares? [This is usually equal to the cost of subscribing for the shares in the first place it represents how much the business will need to pay the shareholder in the event of redemption  recall] 2 What is the stated dividend amount? This is usually defined at a rate thats at or a little above a reasonable interest rate at the time the shares are created, but defined as   share. For example, the shares could have 1  share dividend payment, where the shares originally cost 50 each to subscribe [this would reflect a rate of payment of about 2]. Typically by corporate law, dividends must be paid to preferred shares, to the extent required based on the characteristics of the share class [some preferred shares may not have any required dividends at all], before any dividends can be paid to common shares. So if 10k in dividends is to be paid, and total preferred shares require 15k of noncumulative dividends each year, then 0 will be paid to the common shares. The following year, 15k of dividends will once again need to be paid to the preferred shares, before any can be paid to the common shares."

They can use that info to solicit for donations. \"Hey NFL Player, you have lots of money, and we have cute starving emus that really need your help!\" Heres a blurb from Foundation Source about some of the benefits to starting your own foundation. Get an Immediate Tax Deduction, but Give Later You get the tax deduction when the foundation is funded, then make your charitable gifts over time. Leave a Lasting Legacy Foundations set up in perpetuity can burnish your name far beyond your lifetime. Because gifts are made from an endowment that generates investment revenue, the total gifts made by the foundation can far surpass the actual funding. Be Taken More Seriously as a Philanthropist A foundation imparts a gravitas that causes people to take your philanthropy more seriously, due to the structured, organized approach you employ for your giving. Sidestep Unsolicited Requests When you focus your foundation on specific giving areas, your mission statement can be used to politely turn down offtarget funding requests. Deepen and Focus Your Philanthropy Whereas individual donors often spread their giving among as many causes as possible, the formalized structure of a foundation often encourages donors to narrow their focus to specific causes. Build a Better Family As family members take on philanthropic research, present their findings to the board, participate in the decisionmaking process, and track results, they hone skills that will serve them for years to come. TaxDeductible Grants to Individuals in Need A private foundation allows you to provide emergency assistance directly to individuals using dollars for which youve already received a tax deduction. Run Charitable Programs Without Setting Up a Separate Nonprofit Direct charitable activities are IRSapproved programs that permit foundations to directly fund and carry out their own projects. Pay Charitable Expenses All legitimate and reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out the foundations charitable mission can be paid by the foundation and will count toward the annual minimum distribution requirement. Provide Loans Instead of Grants When used to support a charitable purpose, private foundations can employ loans, loan guarantees, and even equity investments, which are paid back potentially with interest, so you can recycle your philanthropic capital for other charitable causes. httpswww.foundationsource.comresourceslibrarytop10advantagesofaprivatefoundation Theres a similar list here on the website for an attorney that specializes in philanthropy and nonprofits.

    "body": "You have figured out most of the answers for yourself and there is not much more that can be said. From a lenders viewpoint, nonimmigrant students applying for car loans are not very good risks because they are going to graduate in a short time maybe less than the loan duration which is typically three years or more and thus may well be leaving the country before the loan is fully paid off. In your case, the issue is exacerbated by the fact that your OPT status is due to expire in about one years time. So the issue is not whether you are a citizen, but whether the lender can be reasonably sure that you will be gainfully employed and able to make the loan payments until the loan is fully paid off. Yes, lenders care about work history and credt scores but they also care perhaps even care more about the prospects for steady employment and ability to make the payments until the loan is paid off. Yes, you plan on applying for a H1B visa but that is still in the future and whether the visa status will be adjusted is still a matter with uncertain outcome. Also, these are not matters that can be explained easily in an online application, or in a paper application submitted by mail to a distant bank whose name you obtained from some list of \"lenders who have a reliable track record of extending auto loans to nonpermanent residents.\" For this reason, I suggested in a comment that you consider applying at a credit union, especially if there is an Employees Credit Union for those working for your employer. If you go this route, go talk to a loan officer in person rather than trying to do this on the phone. Similarly, a local bank,and especially one where you currently have an account hopefully in good standing, is more likely to be willing to work with you. Failing all this, there is always the auto dealers own loan offers of financing. Finally, one possibility that you might want to consider is whether a oneyear lease might work for you instead of an outright purchase, and you can buy a car after your visa issue has been settled."

    "body": "The simple answer is that you are correct. You should not purchase a house until you are financially stable enough to do so. A house is an asset that you must maintain, and it can be expensive to do so. Over the long term, you will generally save money by purchasing. However, in any given year you may spend much more money than a similar rental situation  even if the rent is higher than your mortgage payment. If you are financially stable with good cash savings or investments plus a 20 down payment, then anytime is a good time to buy if that is part of your financial plan. As of now in 2016, is is safe to assume that mortgage rates wouldshould not get back to 10? Does this mean that one should always buy a house ONLy when mortgage rates are low? Is it worth the wait IF the rates are high right now? The mortgage rates are not the primary driver for your purchase decision. That might be like saying you should buy everything on sale at Target... because its on sale. Dont speculate on future rates. Also, keep in mind that back when rates were high, banks were also giving much better savingsCD rates. That is all connected. Is refinancing an option on the table, if I made a deal at a bad time when rates are high? You need to make sure you get a loan that allows it. Always do a breakeven analysis, looking at the money upfront you spend to refi vs the savingsperyear you will get. This should give you how many years until the refi pays for itself. If you dont plan on being in the house that long, dont do it. How can people afford 10 mortgage? Buying a house they can afford, taking into consideration the entire paymentinterest. It should be a reasonable amount of your monthly income  generally 25 or less. Note that this is much less than you will be approved for by most lenders. Dont let good rates suck you into a deal you will regret. Make sure you have the margin to purchase and maintain a home. Consider where you want to be living in 5 years. Dont leave so little financial breathing room that any bump will place you at risk of foreclosure. That said, home ownership is great! I highly recommend it."

This risk is reduced by 72 with 4 stocks, by 81 with 8 stocks, by 93 with 16 stocks, by 96 with 32 stocks, and by 99 with 500 stocks. Conclusion After purchasing 68 stocks, benefits of adding stocks to decrease risk are small. Overall market risk wont be eliminated merely by adding more stocks. And thats just specific stocks. So youre very right that allocating a 1 share to a specific type of fund is not going to offset your other funds by much. You are correct that you can emulate the lifecycle fund by simply buying all the underlying funds, but there are two caveats Generally, these funds are supposed to be cheaper than buying the separate funds individually. Check over your math and make sure everything is in order. Call the fund manager and tell him about your findings and see what they have to say. If you are going to emulate the lifecycle fund, be sure to stay on top of rebalancing. One advantage of buying the actual fund is that the portfolio distributions are managed for you, so if youre going to buy separate ETFs, make sure youre rebalancing.

    "body": "Your question seems to be making assumptions around investing, that investing is only about stock market and bonds or similar things. I would suggest that you should look much broader than that in terms of your investments. Investment Types Your should consider and include some or all of the following for your investments, depending on your age, your attitude towards risk, the number of dependents you have, your lifestyle, etc. I love Blackjacks explanation of diversification into other asset classes producing a lower risk portfolio. Excellent! All the above need to be considered in this spread of risk, depending as I said earlier on your age, your attitude towards risk, the number of dependents you have, your lifestyle, etc. Stock Market Investment Ill focus most of the rest of my post on the stock markets, as that is where my main experience lies. But the comments are applicable to a greater or lesser extent to other types of investing. We then come to how engaged you want to be with your investments. Two general management styles are passive investment management versus active investment management. Blackjack says That pretty much sums up passive management. The idea is to buy ETFs across asset classes and just leave them. The difficulty with this idea is that profitability is very dependent upon when the stocks are purchased and when they are sold. This is why active investing should be considered as a viable alternative to passive investment. I dont have access to a very long time frame of stock market data, but I do have 30 or so years of FTSE data, so lets say that we invest 100,000 for 10 years by buying an ETF in the FTSE100 index. I know this isnt derisking across a number of asset classes by purchasing a number of different EFTs, but the logic still applies, if you will bear with me. Passive Investing I have chosen my example dates of best 10 years and worst 10 years as specific dates that demonstrate my point that active investing will usually outperform passive investing. From a passive investing point of view, here is a graph of the FTSE with two purchase dates chosen for maximum effect, to show the best and worst return you could receive. Note this ignores brokerage and other fees. In these time frames of data I have  These are contrived dates to illustrate the point, on how ineffective passive investing can be, depending if there is a bearbull market and where you buy in the cycle. One obviously wouldnt buy all their stocks in one tranche, but Im just trying to illustrate the point. Active Investing Lets consider now active investing. I use the following rules for selling and buying This is obviously a very simple technical trading system and I would not recommend using it to trade with, as it is overly simplistic and there are some flaws and inefficiencies in it. So, in my simulation, These beat the passive stock market profit for their respective dates. Summary Passive stock market investing is dependent upon the entry and exit prices on the dates the transactions are made and will trade regardless of market cycles. Active stock market trading or investing engages with the market using a set of criteria, which can change over time, but allows ones investments to be in or out of the market at any point in time. My time frames were arbitrary, but with the logic applied which is a very simple technical trading methodology, I would suggest that any 10 year time frame active investing would beat passive investing."

As a result, investors may not have chosen to buy the securities. The global bond market is highly liquid, and investors who have a choice could well then choose to go elsewhere. The reasons could well be varied, but primary among them would be that investors view Greek investments as more than 5 risky. If I can get 5 from a country that I deem less risky than from Greece, my choice is clear. Therefore to be compensated for loaning them my money, I am expecting a return of 7 because there is the possibility that they will default. As for not selling them at all, if they could avoid issuing bonds, most governments would. They may not have had much of a choice. If they just print more money, that does other potentially bad things to the economy. The government needs funds to operate, if they are not collecting enough in taxes, for example, and do not want to print money as I mentioned, then bonds are one other common way to raise cash.

Historically, real subtracting inflation house prices at least in the U.S. have not risen at all in the long run, and investing all of your own capital in this way may not be optimal. Notice that we are looking at a situation where one is buying a house and living in it in any case. Rent savings are equal in cases a and b. If instead you were buying a house not for yourself, but as a separate investment for renting out, then you would receive rent. In the case a, the real return on your capital will be zero, whereas in case b, you can invest the cash in e.g. the stock market and get, on average, 7 the stock market has yielded a 7 real return annually including dividends annually minus the banks interest rate. If the interest is lower than 7, it may be profitable to take the loan. Of course, the final decision depends on your risk preferences."

    "body": "However, if you are employed by a company that exists in a tax haven and your services are provided to an employer by that tax haven company, it is the tax haven company that gets paid, not you. Under various schemes that company need not pay you at all. For example it may make you a loan which is not taxed ie you dont pay tax on a loan, just as you dont pay tax on the money lent you by a mortgage company. You are bound by the terms of the loan agreement to repay that loan at a rate that the company finds acceptable. Indeed the company may find eventually that it is simply convenient to write off the loan as unrecoverable. if the ownersofficers of he company write off your loans, how much tax will you have paid on the money you have had as loans? The taxman can of course state that this was simply set up to avoid tax which is illegal so you should have a balancing scheme to show that that the loans were taken to supplement income,just as one might take a bank loan  mortgage, not replace it entirely as a tax scam. Hiring tax counsel to provide this adequate proof to HMRC has a price. Frequently this kind of loophole exists because the number of people using it were sufficiently low not to warrant policing  if the policing costs more than the tax recovered, then it is more efficient to ignore it or because at some stage the scheme has been perfectly legal as in the old offshoreeducation trust recommended by the government a few decades ago. When Gordon Brown set out a 75 tax rate for his possibly ideological reasons rather than financially based onesfor those who had these accounts , he encountered opposition from MPs who were going to be caught up paying high tax bills for what was effctively retrospective taxation, so there was a built in loophole to allow the funds to be returned without undue penalty. If you think that is morally wrong, consider what the response would be if a future Chancellor was to declare all IAs the work of the devil and claim that retrospective tax would need to be paid on all ISA transactions over the last few decades.eg tot up all the dividends and capital gains made on an ISA in any year and pay 40 tax on all of them, even if that took the ISA into negative territory because the value today was low underperfoming. Yet this has been sggested as a way of filling in the hole in the budget on the grounds that anyone with an ISA can be represented as rich to a selected party of voters."

In its physical form it represents something real of signifigant value that can be traded for currency or barted. A single pound of gold is worth about 27000 dollars. It is very valuable and it is easily transported as opposed to a car which loses value while you transport it. There are other metals that also hold value Platinum, Silver, Copper, etc as well as other commodities. Platinum has a higher Value to weight ratio than gold but there is less of a global quantity and the demand is not as high. A gold mine is an investement where you hope to take out more in gold than it cost to get it out. Just like any other business. High gold prices simply lower your break even point. TIPS protects you from inflation but does not protect you from devaluation. It also only pays the inflation rate recoginized by the Treasury. There are experts who believe that the fed has understated inflation. If these are correct then TIPS is not protecting its investors from inflation as promised. You can also think of treasury bonds as an investment in your government. Your return will be effectively determined by how they run their business of governing. If you believe that the government is doing the right things to help promote the economy then investing in their bonds will help them to be able to continue to do so. And if consumers buy the bonds then the treasury does not have to buy any more of its own."

If the lending bank is receiving less interest than the going market rate, then theyre losing money. If the bank youve deposited the money with is paying more than the going market rate, theyre losing money. I dont see how you imagine a scenario where someone isnt losing money. For 2 and 3, youre buying stocks on margin, which certainly is something that happens, but youll have to get an account that is specifically for margin trading. Its a specific type of credit with specific rules, and you if you want to engage in this sort of trading, you should go through established channels rather than trying to convert a regular loan into margin trading. If you get a personal loan that isnt specifically for margin trading, and buy stocks with the money, and the stocks tank, you can be in serious trouble. If you do it through margin trading, its still very risky, but not nearly as risky as trying to game the system. In some cases, doing this makes you not only civilly but criminally liable.

Even if assets do pass through probate heirs may dispute the creditors. In that case credit card balances may not be high enough justify hiring a lawyer to fight for payment or, if they do the judge may be unsympathetic and offer nothing or pennies on the dollar.

Most though not necessarily all, so be sure to check bank CDs can be cashed in at any time with a penalty of three months of interest, and so unless you anticipate being laid off very soon, you might get a slightly better rate of interest, FDIC insurance which mutual funds do not have, and with any luck you may never have to break a CD and lose the interest. Building a ladder of CDs with one maturing each month might be another way to reduce the risk of loss. On the other hand, bond mutual funds are a risky bet now because your investment will lose value if interest rate go up, and as JohnFx points out, interest rates have nowhere to go but up. Finally, the amount of the investment is something that you might want to consider before making changes. If you have 50K put away as your sixmonth fund, you are talking of 500 versus 350 per annum in changing to a riskier investment with a 1 yield from a safer investment with a 0.7 yield.

The oversimplified suggestion I would make is to answer the question about your risk aversion. This is the four quadrant e.g., httpnjaes.rutgers.edu8080moneyriskquiz you are introduced to when you first sit down to open your brokerage stocks or employer retirement account 401K. Along with a release of liability in the language of \"past performance is not an indicator...\" which you will not truly understand until you experience a market crash. The reason I say this is because if you are 100 risk averse, then it is clear which vehicles you want to have in your tool belt tbills, CDs, money market, and plain vanilla savings. Absolutely nothing wrong with this. Dont let anyone make you feel otherwise with remarks like \"your money is not working for you sitting there\". Its extremely important to be absolutely honest with yourself in doing this assessment, too. For example, I thought I was a risk taker except when the market tumbled, I reacted exactly how a kneejerk investor would. Also, I feel its not easy to know just how honest you are with yourself as we are humans, and not impartial machines. So the recommendation I would give is to make a strong correlation to casino gambling. In other words, conventional advice is to only take \"play money\" to the casino. This because you assume you WILL lose it. Then you can enjoy yourself at the casino knowing this is capital that you are okay throwing in the trash. I would strongly caution you to only ever invest capital in the stock market that you characterize as play money. Im convinced financial advisors, fund managers, friends will disagree. Still, I feel this is the only way you will be completely okay when the market fluctuates  you wont lose sleep. IF you choose this approach, then you can start investing any time. That five drachma you were going to throw away on lottery tickets? transfer it into your Roth IRA. That twenty yen that you were going to ante in your weekly poker night? transfer it into your index fund. You already got past the investors remorse of losing that money. IF you truly accept that amount as play money, then you CAN put it into penny stocks. Ill get lots of criticism here.

It includes discussions on employee wages and fringe benefits, and income from bartering, partnerships, S corporations, and royalties. Bartering, or giving someone wages or similar in something other than currency or some other specifically defined things, like fringe benefits, is taxed at fair market value Bartering Bartering is an exchange of property or services. You must include in your income, at the time received, the fair market value of property or services you receive in bartering. For additional information, Refer to Tax Topic 420  Bartering Income and Barter Exchanges. Bartering is more specifically covered in Topic 420  Bartering Income You must include in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods or services received from bartering. Generally, you report this income on Form 1040, Schedule C PDF, Profit or Loss from Business Sole Proprietorship, or Form 1040, Schedule CEZ PDF, Net Profit from Business Sole Proprietorship. If you failed to report this income, correct your return by filing a Form 1040X PDF, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Refer to Topic 308 for information on filing an amended return. More details about income in general beyond the above articles is available in Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income. It goes into great detail about different kinds of income. In your example, youd have to calculate the fair market value of an avocado, and then determine how much cashequivalent you were paid in. The IRS wouldnt necessarily tell you what that value was youd calculate it based on something you feel you could justify to them afterwards. The way Id do it would be to write down the price of avocados at each pay period, and apply a dollarcostaveraging type method to determine the total pays fair value. While the avocado example is of course largely absurd, the advent of bitcoins has made this much more relevant. Publication 525 has this to say about virtual currency Virtual Currency. If your employer gives you virtual currency such as Bitcoin as payment for your services, you must include the fair market value of the currency in your income. The fair market value of virtual currency such as Bitcoin paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contribution Act FICA tax, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act FUTA tax and must be reported on Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement. Gold would be fundamentally similar  although I am not sure its legal to pay someone in gold assuming it were, though, its fair market value would be again the definition of income. Similarly, if youre paid in another countrys currency, the US dollar equivalent of that is what youll pay taxes on, at the fair market value of that currency in US dollars."

Then somebody had the bright idea of making a fund that just buys the SP, and then sells small pieces of it to investor without huge mountains of capital. Enter the ETFs. The guy running the ETF, of course, doesnt do it for free. He skims a little bit of money off the top. This is the \"fee\". The major SP ETFs all have tiny fees, in the percents of a percent. If youre buying the index, youre probably looking at gains or losses to the tune of 5, 10, 20  unless youre doing something really silly, you wouldnt even notice the fee. As often happens, when one guy starts doing something and making money, there will immediately be copycats. So now we have competing ETFs all providing the same service. You are technically a competitor as well, since you could compete with all these funds by just buying a basket of shares yourself, thereby running your own private fund for yourself. The reason this stuff even started was that people said, \"well why bother with mutual funds when they charge such huge fees and still dont beat the index anyway\", so the index ETFs are supposed to be a low cost alternative to mutual funds. Thus one thing ETFs compete on is fees You can see how VOO has lower fees than SPY and IVV, in keeping with Vanguards philosophy of minimal management and management fees. Incidentally, if you buy the shares directly, you wouldnt charge yourself fees, but you would have to pay commissions on each stock and it would destroy you  another benefit of the ETFs. Moreover, these ETFs claim they track the index, but of course there is no real way to peg an asset to another. So they ensure tracking by keeping a carefully curated portfolio. Of course nobody is perfect, and theres tracking error. You can in theory compare the ETFs in this respect and buy the one with the least tracking error. However they all basically track very closely, again the error is fractions of the percent, if it is a legitimate concern in your books then youre not doing index investing right. The actual prices of each fund may vary, but the price hardly matters  the key metric is does it go up 20 when the index goes up 20? And they all do. So what do you compare them on? Well, typically companies offer people perks to attract them to their own product. If you are a Fidelity customer, and you buy IVV, they will waive your commission if you hold it for a month. I believe Vanguard will also sell VOO for free. But for instance Fidelity will take commission from VOO trades and vice versa. So, this would be your main factor. Though, then again, you can just make an account on Robinhood and theyre all commission free. A second factor is reliability of the operator. Frankly, I doubt any of these operators are at all untrustworthy, and youd be buying your own brokers ETF anyway, and presumably you already went with the most trustworthy broker. Besides that, like I said, theres trivial matters like fees and tracking error, but you might as well just flip a coin. It doesnt really matter."

    "body": "I assume you get your information from somewhere where they dont report the truth. Im sorry if mentioning Fox News offended you, it was not my intention. But the way the question is phrased suggests that you know nothing about what \"pension\" means. So let me explain. 403b is not a pension account. Pension account is generally a \"defined benefit\" account, whereas 403b401k and similar  are \"defined contribution\" accounts. The difference is significant for pensions, the employer committed on certain amount to be paid out at retirement the defined benefit regardless of how much the employeeemployer contributed or how well the account performed. This makes such an arrangement a liability. An obligation to pay. In other words  debt. Defined contribution on the other hand doesnt create such a liability, since the employer is only committed for the match, which is paid currently. What happens to your account after the employer deposited the defined contribution the match  is your problem. You manage it to the best of your abilities and whatever you have there when you retire  is yours, the employer doesnt owe you anything. Heres the problem with pensions many employers promised the defined benefit, but didnt do anything about actually having money to pay. As mentioned, such a pension is essentially a debt, and the retiree is a debt holder. What happens when employer cannot pay its debts? Employer goes bankrupt. And when bankrupt  debtors are paid only part of what they were owed, and that includes the retirees. Theres noone raiding pensions. Noone goes to the bank with a gun and demands \"give me the pension money\". What happened was that the employers just didnt fund the pensions. They promised to pay  but didnt set aside any money, or set aside not enough. Instead, they spent it on something else, and when the time came that the retirees wanted their money  they didnt have any. Thats what happened in Detroit, and in many other places. 403b is in fact the solution to this problem. Instead of defined benefit  the employers commit on defined contribution, and after that  its your problem, not theirs, to have enough when youre retired."

    "body": "Their is no arbitrage opportunity with \"buying dividends.\" Youre buying a taxable event. This is a largely misunderstood topic. The stock always drops by the amount if the dividend on the ex date. The stock opens that day trading \"ex\" excluding the dividend. It then pays out later based in the shareholders on record. There is a lot of talk about price movement and value here. That can happen but its from trading not from the dividend per se. Yes sometimes you do see a stock pop the day prior to ex date because people are buying the stock for the dividend but the trading aspect of a stock is determined by supply and demand from people trading the stock. The dividends are paid out from the owners equity section of the balance sheet. This is a return of equity to shareholders. The idea is to give owners of the company some of their investment back from when they bought the stock without having the owners sell the shares of the company. After all if its a good company you want to keep holding it so it will appreciate. Another similar way to think of it is like a bonds interest payment. People sometimes forget when trading that these are actual companies meant to be invested in. Your buying an ownership in the company with your cash. It really makes no difference to buy the dividend or not, all other things constant. Though market activity can add or lose value from trading as normal."

Separately, you can determine ownership share by contribution amounts, maybe one of you contributed 2,000 and the other 8,000 this would be an 8020 split. The performance of the operation doesnt have anything to do with determining how to divide the pie, your partnership agreement determines that. How much have you each contributed and what agreement did you make before you decided to be partners? If you have a poor performing business segment, then the partnership should get together and consider adjusting or stopping that line of business.

You can start by putting your current salary next to your age, adjust the percent of income saved 14 for you and put in the current total. The sheet basically shows that if one saves 15 from day one of working and averages an 8 return, they are on track to save over 20X their final income, and at the 4 withdrawal rate, will replace 80 of their income. Remember, if they save 15 and at retirement the 7.65 FICA medicare goes away, so its 100 of what they had anyway. For what its worth, a 10 average return drops what you need to save down to 9. I say to a young person  try to start at 15. Better that when youre 40, you realize youre well ahead of schedule and can relax a bit, than to assume that 89 is enough to save and find you need a large increase to catch up. To answer specifically here  there are those who concluded that 4 is a safe withdrawal rate, so by targeting 20X your final income as retirement savings, youll be able to retire well. Retirement spending needs are not the same for everyone. When I cite an 80 replacement rate, its a guess, a rule of thumb that many point out is flawed. The real number is your true spending need, which of course can be far higher or lower. The younger investor is going to have a far tougher time guessing this number than someone a decade away from retiring. The 80 is just a target to get started, it should shift to the real number in your 40s or 50s as that number becomes clear. Next, I see my original answer didnt address Social Security benefits. The benefit isnt linear, a lower wage earner can see a benefit of as much as 50 of what they earned each year while a very high earner would see far less as the benefit has a maximum. A 90k earner will see 30 or less. The social security site does a great job of giving you your projected benefit, and you can adjust target savings accordingly. 2016 update  the prior 20 years returned 8.18 CAGR. Considering there were 2 crashes one of which was called a minidepression, 8.18 is pretty remarkable. For what its worth, my adult investing life started in 1984, and Ive seen a CAGR of 10.90.

And in regards to backtesting DCA to Timing The Markets, I have done that too in my answer to the following question Investing in low cost index fund  does the timing matter? Timing the Markets wins hand down. In regards to backtesting and the concerns Kent Anderson has brought up, when I backtest a trading strategy, if that strategy is successful, I then forward test it over a year or two to confirm the results. As with backtesting you can sometimes curve fit your criteria too much. By forward testing you are confirming that the strategy is robust over different market conditions. One strategy you can take when the market does start to fall is short selling, as mentioned by some already. I am now short selling using CFDs over the short to medium term as one of my more aggressive strategies. I have a longer term strategy where I do not short, but tighten my stop losses when the market starts to tank. Sometimes my positions will keep going up even though the market as a whole is heading down, and I can make an extra 5 to 10 on these positions before I get taken out. The rare position even continues going up during the whole downturn and when the market starts to recover. So I let the market decide when I get out and when I stay in, I leave my emotions out of it. The best thing you can do is have a written trading plan with all your criteria for getting into the market, your criteria for getting out of the market and your position sizing and risk management incorporated in the plan."

Depends on which side of the bet youre on  Suppose a hedge fund manager thinks a company is poorly run. He may buy a ton of shares so that he can get rid of the current CEO and replace it with hisher own. For the hedge fund and others long on the stock, this is good. Those who are trading options or using some shortterm strategies could get screwed because of the sudden volatility. My next point is related to the above. What is the intrinsic value of a stock? The current price of a stock is the equilibrium of all investors perception of the stocks value. Professionals make up a value for a stock using models such as DCF. Once they do so they trade based on what they believe the value of the stock is. You might calculate a stock is worth 70 and I believe its 80 so the stock price is going to fluctuate a bit but it should keep within that range assuming were the only investors. Then comes a hedge fund manager, say Carl Icahn, and discloses a stake in our stock. \"Wow, the stock must be really valuable!\" Everyone starts buying this stock so up it goes to 90, simply because the guy who seems to know what hes doing bought it. The point here is that now its not trading based on intrinsic value, now its purely psychological. Ie. its now a momentum stock, which you have no idea when itll crash. Look at Tesla, Netflix, or just google momentum stocks. All the big crashes in stock prices happen when these big funds unload their stocks. A surge in supply will cut the price. The problem is you cant predict when some fund manager will decide to sell some stake of his. Tying everything together is liquidity. The more liquid a stock is, the easier it is to obtain and the less volatile it is. The more people playing the game, with not too big shares of stock, the faster the price will converge to some equilibrium and with less volatility. Institutional investors take away liquidity."

A lot of people mistakenly call them tax free, which theyre not. There is no such thing as a \"taxfree\" retirement account. Really, in terms of Roth vs. Traditional IRAs, its \"pay now or pay later.\" With the exception of special circumstances like this, I recommend investing exclusively in Roth IRAs for money that you expect to grow much or that you expect to produce substantial income over time. Just to add a few thoughts on what to actually invest in once you open your IRA, I strongly agree with the advice that you invest mostly in lowcost mutual funds or index funds. The advantage of an openended mutual fund is that its easier to purchase them in odd increments and you may be able to avoid at least some purchase fees, whereas with an ETF you have to buy in multiples of that days asking price. For example, if you were investing 500 and the ETF costs 200 per share, you could only purchase 2 shares, leaving 100 uninvested minus whatever fee your broker charged for the purchase. The advantage of an ETF is that its easy to buy or sell quickly. Usually, when you add money to a mutual fund, itll take a few days for it to hit your account, and when you want to sell itll similarly take a few days for you to get your money when I buy an ETF the transaction can occur almost instantly. The fees can also be lower if the ETF is just a passive index fund. Also, theres a risk with openended mutual funds that if too many people pull money out at once the managers could be forced to sell stocks at an unfavorable price."

    "body": "Uh, you want to lease a car through a dealer? That is the worst possible way to obtain a car. Dealers love leases because it allows them to sell a car for an unnegotiated price and to hide additional fees. Its the most profitable kind of sale for them. The best option would be to buy a used car off of Craigslist or eBay, then sell it again the same way when you leave. If you sell the car for what you paid, then you get the car for a year for free. If you are determined to go through with the expensive, risky and annoying plan of leasing a car, then you should use a leasing agent. I recommend reading some car buying guides before going out into the wilderness with the tigers and bears. Comment on Leasing Tricks Dont get tricked by the \"interest rate\" game. The whole interest thing is just a distraction to trick you into think you are getting some kind of reasonable deal. The leasing company makes most of their money from fees. For example, if you get into an accident it is a big payday for them. The average person thinks they will never get into an accident, but the reality is that most people get into an accident sooner or later. They also collect big penalties for \"maintenance failures\". Forget to change the oil? BOOM! money. Forget to comply with manufacture recall? BOOM! more money. Forget to do the annual service? BOOM! more money. Scratch the car? BOOM! more money. The original car mats are missing? BOOM! you just paid 400 for a set of mats that cost the leasing company 25 bucks. The leasing company is counting on the fact that 99 of people will not maintain the car correctly or will damage it in some way. They also usually have all kinds of other bogus fees, socalled \"walkaway fees\", \"disposition fees\", \"initiation fees\". Whatever they think they can get away with. The whole system is calculated to screw you."

Although the recommendation keeps varying a bit. However your first investment should not aim for diversification. Putting small amounts in multiple mutual funds may create paper work and tracking issues. My suggestion would be to start with an Index EFT or Large cap. Then move to balanced funds and mid caps etc. On this site we dont advise on specific funds. You can refer to moneycontrol.com or economictimes or quite a few other personal finance advisory sites to understand the top funds in the segments and decide on funds accordingly.

Many people panic and sell at the worst possible time, and that kills their returns. Will that be you? Its impossible to tell until it happens. Dont just invest in stocks. Put some of your money in bonds. For example TIPS, which are inflation adjusted treasury bonds very safe, and the return is tied to the rate of inflation. That way, when the stock market falls, youll have a backstop and youll be less likely to sell at the wrong time. A 5050 stockbond mix is probably reasonable. Some recommend your age in bonds, which for you means 20 or so. Personally I think 5050 is better even at your young age. Invest in broad market indexes, such as the SP 500. Steer clear of individual stocks except for maybe 510 of your total. Individual stocks carry the risk of going out of business, such as Enron. Follow Warren Buffets two rules of investing a Dont lose money b See rule a. Ignore the \"investment porn\" that is all around you in the form of TV shows and ads. Dont chase hot companies, sectors or countries. Try to estimate what youll need for retirement if thats what your investing for and dont take more risk than you need to. Try to maintain a very simple portfolio that youll be able to sleep well with. For example, check into the coffeehouse investor Pay a visit to the Bogleheads Forum  you can ask for advice there and the advice will be excellent. Avoid investments with high fees. Get advice from a good feeonly investment advisor if needed. Dont forget to enjoy some of your money now as well. You might not make it to retirement. Read, read, read about investing and retirement.

The difference is that a share of stock means that you own a piece of a corporation. You cant physically take possession of it and put it in your garage, because if all the stockholders did that, then all the companys assets would be scattered around all the stockholders garages and the company couldnt function. Like if you bought a 111 share in a football team, you couldnt take one of the football players home and keep him in your closet, because then the team wouldnt be able to function. I might want to take one of the cheerleaders home, but thats another subject ... In preelectronic times, you could get a piece of paper that said, \"XYZ Corporation  1 share\". You could take physical possession of this piece of paper and put it in your filing cabinet. Im not sure if you can even get such certificates any more I havent seen one in decades. These days its just recorded electronically. That doesnt mean that you dont own it. It just means that someone else is keeping the records for you. Its like leaving your car in a parking lot.

I could have bought more recent models, but I was trying to save money. But in 2010 I found a very low mileage 2008 Smart Car for small money. It was a good deal at the time. It was almost new, having very low mileage, and about 60 of the price of a new, less well appointed Smart. I found out that I really like driving cars that wont break down and leave me stranded in sleet or ice storms. When my wifes Mazda hatchback finally rusted to the point that it wouldnt pass the safety inspection and couldnt be repaired, we bought a new 2013 Toyota Rav4. We are really happy with it.

Principal reduction is 1127. I get 4.32 or 432. But this is nonsense, you divide the interest over the mortgage balance, and get 6. You only get those crazy numbers by dividing meaningless ratios. The fact that early on in a mortgage most of the payment goes to interest is a simple fact of the the 30 year nature of amortizing. You are in control, just add extra principal to the payment, if you wish. This idea sounds like the Money Merge Account peddled by UFirst. Its a scam if ever there was one. I wrote about it extensively on my site and have links to others as well. Once you get to this page, the first link is for a free spreadsheet to download, it beats MMA every time and shows how prepaying works, no smoke, no mirrors. The second link is a 65 page PDF that compiles nearly all my writing on this topic as I was one of the finance bloggers doing what I could to expose this scam.

No agent who dialoged with me in public could answer my questions in full, as they fell back on \"you need to believe in it.\" I have no issue with faithbased religion, it actually stands to reason, but mortgages are numbers and theres order to them.

Grey Sheets, and also known as the \"Gray Market\" is another category of OTC stocks that is completely separate from Pink Sheets and the OTCBB. From investopedia The grey market is an overthecounter market where dealers may execute orders for preferred customers as well as provide support for a new issue before it is actually issued. This activity allows underwriters and the issuer to determine demand and price the securities accordingly before the IPO. Some additional information on this type of stocks. Source Unlike other financial markets... No recent bid or ask quotes are available because no market makers share data or quote such stocks. There is no quoting system available to record and settle trades. All Grey sheet trading is moderated by a broker and done between consenting individuals at a price they agree on. The only documentation that can be publicly found regarding the trades is when the last trade took place. No SEC registration and little SEC regulation. Regulation of Grey Sheet stocks takes place mainly on a state level. Unlike Pink Sheets, these stocks have no SEC registration to possess a stock symbol or to possess shares or trade shares of that stock. Such penny stocks, similar to Pink Sheets, are not required to file SEC Securities and Exchange Commission financial and business reports. These stocks may not be solicited or advertised to the public unless a certain number of shares are qualified to be traded publicly under 504 of Regulation D. Extremely Illiquid. Gray sheet trading is infrequent, and for good reason... Difficult to trade, not advertised, difficult to follow the price, the least regulation possible, hard to find any information on the stock, very small market cap, little history, and most such stocks do not yet offer public shares. The lack of information bids, history, financial reports alone causes most investors to be very skeptical of Gray Sheets and avoid them altogether. Gray Sheets are commonly associated with Initial public offering IPO stocks or start up companies or spinoff companies, even though not all are IPOs, startups or spinoffs. Grey Sheets is also Home to delisted stocks from other markets. Some stocks on this financial market were once traded on the NASDAQ, OTCBB, or the Pink Sheets but ran into serious misfortune  usually financial  and thus failed to meet the minimum requirements of the registered SEC filings andor stock exchange regulations for a financial market. Such stocks were delisted or removed and may begin trading on the Grey Sheets. So to answer your question, I think the cause of the wild swings is that Great question, BTW."

    "body": "A few years ago I had a 5 year car loan. I wanted to prepay it after 2 years and I asked this question to the lender. I expected a reduction in the interest attached to the car loan since it didnt go the full 5 years. They basically told me I was crazy and the balance owed was the full amount of the 5 year car loan. This sounds like you either got a bad car loan i.e. pay all the interest first before paying any principal, a crooked lender, or you were misunderstood. Most consumer loans both car loans and mortgages reduce the amount of interest you pay not the percentage as you pay down principal. The amount of interest of each payment is computed by multiplying the balance owed by the periodic interest rate e.g. if your loan is at 12 annual interest youll pay 1 of the remaining principal each month. Although thats the most common loan structure, there are others that are more complex and less friendly to the consumer. Typically those are used when credit is an issue and the lender wants to make sure they get as much interest up front as they can, and can recover the principal through a repossession or foreclosure. It sounds like you got a precomputed interest loan. With these loans, the amount of interest youd pay if you paid through the life of the loan is computed and added to the principal to get a total loan balance. You are required to pay back that entire amount, regardless of whether you pay early or not. You could still pay it early just to get that monkey off your back, but you may not save any interest. You are not crazy to think that you should be able to save on interest, though, as thats how normal loans work. Next time you need to borrow money, make sure you understand the terms of the loan and if you dont, ask someone else to help you. Or just save up cash and dont borrow money "

If you go for the MBA right now, you may miss your chance to work in the oil industry for another few years or weeks, but at the same time, the MBA lasts forever although, real world experience is also relevant and it may give you a leg up when you are 50 years old in the unemployment line or maybe not, because you are overqualified everything in life is a costbenefit analysis Passing the GRE lasts for five years, so keep that in mind"

    "body": "Sometimes I think a question like this is one of moral versus legal. The reality is that you know you owe the money because you received the services. Youre right that the bill should have been sent to you, and the natural urge for many people is to just count it in the win column when things like this happen and theres the chance to avoid paying. I suppose my question for you is, are you comfortable with the notion that you are not paying something that your heart of hearts tells you should be paid? If roles were reversed and you, as a business owner, had forgotten to bill something for which you were rightfully due payment, wouldnt you hope theyd have the integrity to pay you anyway? The legal side of this can be a bit trickier, and much depends on the state youre in assuming youre in the U.S. because some have stiffer consumer collection and protection laws than others. The rehab center could, when doing an audit of its accounts, discover that you didnt pay for these. They could take the polite course of action and call you with a gentle reminder or send a bill, or they could be not so nice about it. Either way, they cant send anything to collections for which you havent been presented a bill and demonstrated an unwillingness to pay. Theres a process in place, regardless of the state, so they cant just automatically put it into collections. I will close with this question for you did the rehab center help you with what you needed, and are you healthier and better because of their care? If so, pay the bill. Thats my advice. Keep in mind that unpaid medical costs just raise the prices for everyone else, because these providers will make up for the loss somewhere. I hope this helps. Good luck!"

    "body": "I think the advice Bob is being given is good. Bob shouldnt sell his investments just because their price has gone down. Selling cheap is almost never a good idea. In fact, he should do the opposite When his investments become cheaper, he should buy more of them, or at least hold on to them. Always remember this rule Buy low, sell high. This might sound illogical at first, why would someone keep an investment that is losing value? Well, the truth is that Bob doesnt lose or gain any money until he sells. If he holds on to his investments, eventually their value will raise again and offset any temporary losses. But if he sells as soon as his investments go down, he makes the temporary losses permanent. If Bob expects his investments to keep going down in the future, naturally he feels tempted to sell them. But a true investor doesnt try to anticipate what the market will do. Trying to anticipate market fluctuations is speculating, not investing. Quoting Benjamin Graham The most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stockmarket movements. The speculators primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investors primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell. Assuming that the fund in question is wellmanaged, I would refrain from selling it until it goes up again."

I narrowed things down to 45 companies, studying their technology plans, then researched their business plans and their personnel. In the end I picked a drug company. Not only did it have a promising business plan, but it had as its CEO a hotshot from some other company, and the BOD was populated buy big names from tech companies and the like. AND the company had like 2 of cash for every 1 of outstanding share value, following their recent IPO. So I sold a bit of stock I had in my employer and bought like 3000 worth of this company. Then, taking the advice Id seen several places, I forgot about it for about 6 months. When I went back to look their stock value had dropped a little, and the cash reserves were down about 20. I wasnt too worried. 6 months later the cash was down 50. Worrying a little. After Id had the stock for about 2 years the stock price was about 10 of what Id paid. Hardly worth selling, so I hung on for awhile longer. The company was eventually sold to some other company and I got maybe 50 in stock in the new company."

There is always of course the choice to NOT buy a house, and just rent, or if you had the feeling that you are near the top of a bubble, SELL and go back to renting.

You could always value your assets with mark to model, and maybe you do, but no one else will. Just because you think the stock is worth 2X doesnt mean the rest of the world agrees, evidenced by the bid. You surely wont get any margin loans based upon mark to model. Your bankers wont be convinced of the valuation of your assets based upon mark to model. By strictly a market value oriented way of valuing assets, there is a bidask cost. more clarification Relative to littleadv, this is actually a good exposition between the differences between cash and accrual accounting. littleadv is focusing completely on the cash cost of the asset at the time of transaction and saying that there is no bidask cost. Through the lens of cash accounting, that is 100 correct. However, if one uses accrual accounting marking assets to market as we all do with marketable assets like stocks, bonds, options, etc, there may be a bidask cost. At the time of transaction, the bids used to trade ones own are exhausted. According to exchange rules that are now practically uniform the highest bid is given priority, and if two bids are bidding the exact same highest price then the oldest bid is given priority therefore the oldest highest bid has been exhausted and removed at trade. At the time of transaction, the value of the asset cannot be ones own bid but the highest oldest bid leftover. If that highest oldest bid is lower than the price paid even with liquid stocks this is usually the case then one has accrued a bidask cost."

In my experience, it is good if you can manage to make the first small investing steps before starting your career. Real jobs tend to need lots of time particularly at the beginning, so time to learn investing is extremely scarce right at the time when you for the first time in your life earn money that couldshould be invested. Im talking of very slowly starting with a single purchase of say an ETF, a single bond next time you have saved up a suitable amount of toy money, then maybe a single share and essentially not doing anything with them in order to avoid further fees. While such a \"portfolio\" is terrible with respect to diversification and relative fees, this gives you the possibility to learn the procedures, to see how the fees cut in, what to do wrt taxes etc. This is why I speak about toy money and why I consider this money an investment in education.  An order fee of, say, 10 on a 500 position are terrible 4 2 x 10 for buying  selling  depending on your local taxes, that would be several years of dividend yield for say some arbitrary Dow Jones ETF.

The price of a stock like many other things reflects what the seller is prepared to sell it at and what the buyer is prepared to offer for it. If those things match then a transaction can take place. The seller loses money but gains stocks they feel represent equivalent value, the reverse happens for the buyer. Take buying a house for example, did the buyer lose money when they bought a house, sure they did but they gained a house. The seller gained money but lost a house. New money is created in the sense that companies can and do make profits, those profits, together with the expected profits from future years increase the value that is put on the company. If we take something simple like a mining company then its value represents a lot of things and numerous other lesser things too. The value of shares in the mining company will reflect all of these things. It likely rises and falls in line with the price of the raw materials it mines and those change based on the overall supply and demand for those raw materials. Stocks do have an inherent value, they are ownership of a part of a company. You own part of the asset value, profits and losses made by that company.

    "body": "Your assumption that funds sold in GBP trade in GBP is incorrect. In general funds purchase their constituent stocks in the fund currency which may be different to the subscription currency. Where the subscription currency is different from the fund currency subscriptions are converted into the fund currency before the extra money is used to increase holdings. An ETF, on the other hand, does not take subscriptions directly but by creation and redemption of shares. The principle is the same however monies received from creation of ETF shares are converted into the fund currency and then used to buy stock. This ensures that only one currency transaction is done. In your specific example the fund currency will be USD so your purchase of the shares assuming there are no sellers and creation occurs will be converted from GBP to USD and held in that currency in the fund. The fund then trades entirely in USD to avoid currency risk. When you want to sell your exposure supposing redemption occurs enough holdings required to redeem your money are sold to get cash in USD and then converted to GBP before paying you. This means that trading activity where there is no need to convert to GBP or any other currency does not incur currency conversion costs. In practice funds will always have some cash or cash equivalents on hand to pay out redemptions and will have an idea of the number and size of redemptions each calendar period so will use futures and swaps to mitigate FX risk. Where the same firm has two funds traded in different currencies with the same objectives it is likely that one is a wrapper for the other such that one simply converts the currency and buys the other currency denominated ETF. As these are exchange traded funds with a price in GBP the amount you pay for the ETF or gain on selling it is the price given and you will not have to consider currency exchange as that should be done internally as explained above. However, there can be a temporary arbitrage opportunity if the price in GBP does not reflect the price in USD and the exchange rate put together."

Yes  you can make a nondeductable contribution to a traditional IRA and convert it to a Roth IRA. Here is Wikipedias explanation Regardless of income but subject to contribution limits, contributions can be made to a Traditional IRA and then converted to a Roth IRA.[10] This allows for \"backdoor\" contributions where individuals are able to avoid the income limitations of the Roth IRA. There is no limit to the frequency with which conversions can occur, so this process can be repeated indefinitely. One major caveat to the entire \"backdoor\" Roth IRA contribution process, however, is that it only works for people who do not have any pretax contributed money in IRA accounts at the time of the \"backdoor\" conversion to Roth conversions made when other IRA money exists are subject to prorata calculations and may lead to tax liabilities on the part of the converter. [9] Do note the caveat in the second paragraph. This article explains it more thoroughly The IRS does not allow converters to specify which dollars are being converted as they can with shares of stock being sold for the purposes of determining taxes on conversions the IRS considers a persons nonRoth IRA money to be a single, comingled sum. Hence, if a person has any funds in any nonRoth IRA accounts, it is impossible to contribute to a Traditional IRA and then convert that account to a Roth IRA as suggested by various pundits and the Wikipedia piece referenced above  conversions must be performed on a prorata basis of all IRA money, not on specific dollars or accounts. Say you have 20k of pretax assets in a traditional IRA, and make a nondeductable contribution of 5k. The account is now 80 pretax assets and 20 posttax assets, so if you move 5k into a Roth IRA, 4k of it would be taxed in the conversion. The traditional IRA would be left with 16k of pretax assets and 4k of posttax assets."

Investors who rely on analysis of fundamentals tend to be more longterm strategic planners than most other investors, who seem more focused on momentumbased thinking. There are some industries which have historically low PE ratios, such as utilities, but I dont think that implies poor growth prospects. How often does a utility go out of business? I think oftentimes if you really look into the numbers, there are companies reporting higher earnings and earnings growth, but is that topline growth, or is it the result of costcutting and other measures which artificially imply a healthy and growing company? A healthy company is one which shows yearoveryear organic growth in revenues and earnings from sales, not one which has to continually make new acquisitions or use accounting tricks to dress up the bottom line. Is it possible to do well by investing in companies with solid fundamentals? Absolutely. You may not realize the same rate of shortterm returns as others who use momentumbased trading strategies, but over the long haul Im willing to bet youll see a better overall average return than they do."

In the case of always wanting a new car every 2 or 3 years it can make sense to lease. Of course if you drive more the allowed miles you will pay extra at the end of the lease. If you can take the monthly lease as a business expense leasing makes sense. Otherwise you want to pay cash, or get financing. Does zero percent make sense? Sometimes. The only way to make sense of the numbers is to start with your bank, have them approve of the loan first. Then armed with the maximum loan amount they will give you and the rate and the length of the loan, then visit the dealer. You have to run the numbers for your situation. It depends on your income, your other expenses, your credit score, your bank, what deal the dealership is running, how much you have for a down payment. Here is an example. For a recent loan situation I saw 36 months, 1.49 rate, 20K loan, total interest paid 466. Armed with that information can the person get a better deal at the dealership? There was only one way to find out. In that case the credit union was better. The rebate was larger than the interest paid."

If your phone is a cell phone \"it is against the law for a company to leave a prerecorded message on your cell phone.\" In fact, the call frequency increased once they realized they had reached a live person. I called each of these companies multiple times, and though I was given assurances each time that my number would be taken off of their lists, the calls continued, morning, noon and night. At my wits end, I decided the only way to have the harassing calls stop was to file suits against the collection companies. Its very important to understand that it is against the law for a company to leave a prerecorded message on your cell phone. Armed with this knowledge, I filed suit against several of the collection companies. I filed in small claims court so I did not need to hire an attorney, and the process was as simple as completing a paragraph on a complaint form. For evidence, I had over a hundred Google Voicemail transcripts showing the times the companies called and the text of the prerecorded messages. Mysteriously, the calls all stopped immediately on the same date the collection companies received the certified letters stating they were being sued. Then a new flurry of calls began pouring in. This time it was their attorneys. The attorneys representing these out of state collection companies were all desperate to settle out of court. hey did not want to incur the expense of traveling for court or hiring a local law firm who wasnt on retainer. They also understood they had no justifiable defense for the calls. To make a long story short, so far I have successfully sued 3 of these collection companies and settled for more than 5,000 out of court. All it cost me was 35 and 20 minutes per suit. Making these companies pay is the only incentive for them to stop their illegal and harassing practices. If more consumers knew their rights and actually took a few minutes to stand up for them, it would become less profitable for these companies to conduct business the way they do now. Source And whether you have a cell phone or land line, It is illegal for the debt collectors to tell you they are calling to collect a debt for someone else under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act wikipedia, ftc docs. What Remedies Are Available If The Debt Collector Violates The Law Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you have the right to sue a debt collector in state or federal court within one year from the date of the violation. If you win, you may recover damages in the amount of any losses you suffered as a result of the violation, plus an additional amount of up to 1,000.00. You may also be able to recover court costs and attorney fees. If the same debt collector has engaged in unlawful conduct with a number of consumers, it may be possible to find a lawyer who will file a class action lawsuit. Source With regard to whether you can sue under FDCPA if you are not the debtor, one FDCPA lawyer take with grain of salt says yes Did you know that it doesnt matter if you owe the account the debt collector is calling you about or not?

Lets say someone was late in paying you and you wanted to document the fact that they were late. Ive had latepaying customers send me a check dated on the due date but really they just predated the check and sent it 60 days pastdue. So lets say I want to establish and document the pattern in case it becomes a future legal issue. When you deposit or cash a check, an image of the front and back is made and the person or company who issued the check will have those images stored as part of their transaction history. It used to be that the original, physical, cancelled check was returned to the payer, but that was another era. So write the date received on the back next to the endorsement, endorse the check, and take a photo of the front and back along with the postmark on the envelope to document that they are a late payer. This way, if it ever becomes a \"he said she said\" issue you can easily show they have a history of paying late. If the payer looks at their check images theyll see your received date note next to the endorsement. Granted, this is a lot of trouble for a unique situation. In 20 years of running a business Ive actually had the foresight to do this a handful of times with habitual offenders, and in only one case did it come in handy later on.

    "body": "I think the problem is that youve made a math error. This child would not be costing you 300 per month, it will be costing you 1400 per month. 1100 of this is in a donation of salable hours rather than cash, but helpfully you have a number right there as to how much someone is willing to pay for these hours so the math is still doable. So, if you are indeed splitting your expenses fiftyfifty, you should chip 1100 into the pot to match your wifes contribution. It would make the most sense, I think, to have your part of this contribution cover some of your mutual expenses, and if any is left over, save it up for the day that your child would cost more than that 300 in a month  when you need extra clothes, or have to replace something they destroyed, or want to pay for extra opportunities camps, educational games, lessons, or a a savings that can be used for major future expenses higher education, first car, milestone celebrations, safety net when starting out. Of course, if your family is indeed a priority, you might consider making an equal investment in your family  say, half your income 1800 to match half her time going into the building of the family. After all, the decision to start a family should be an investment of time and value, not just a minimum bid for expenses. And again, any extra can be spent on mutual expenses, saved up for future costs, or left as your childs \"savings\" for major expenses or safety net. I suppose I should mention that you perhaps could get away with covering half her contribution 550 per month, on the face of it, as that should also \"balance\" out the monthly expenses. Even this much would be enough to put her back into the green on her covering her own costs. Of course, in this case you might want to take into account that while shes working 38,5 hours per week now, running a household is, Ive heard, more closely equivalent to a 60hour week, plus or minus being \"on call\" for a further 100 hours a week. Trying to calculate the absolute minimum payment on your part to match the investment of hours on hers is likely to be a bit more tricky than just matching the salable hours not worked, if youre set on income ratios and splitting costs \"as they are\". Also, you might want to rethink your criteria for sharing income completely or what makes certain divisions of costs \"unfair\". You mention one reason it would be unfair is that you have a \"more stressful job\"  well, your job may well be more stressful than her job now, but it is likely to be less so than raising a child her new job. As for investment of time and energy for your education entitling you to a larger amount of pay, again, raising a child is likely to be a larger investment of time, money, and anxiety than your education, but her pay or even share of the costs doesnt seem to be balanced in response. Im not gonna tell you what is fair, thats for you to work out, just suggesting you really think it through before deciding what would be fair or not."

If you put 400,000 in a decent index fund at an average 8 growth, and add 75,000 every year, in 10 years youll have about 1.95 Million, 800k of which is capital gain more or less due to market risk, of course  or 560k after 30 tax. If you instead put it in the whole life policy at 1.7 youll have about 1.3 Million, 133k of which is taxfree capital gain. So the insurance is costing you 430K in opportunity cost, since you could have done something different with the money for more return. The fund you mentioned Vanguard Wellington has a 10year annualized growth of 7.13. At that growth rate, the opportunity cost is 350k. Even with a portfolio with a more conservative 5 growth rate, the opportunity cost is 178k Now the life insurance. Life insurance is a highly personal product, but I ran a quick quote for a 65year old male in good health and got a premium of 11,000 per year for a 2M 10year term policy. So the same amount of term life insurance costs only 110,000. Much less than the 430k in opportunity cost that the whole life would cost you. In addition, you have a mortgage thats costing you about 28K per year now 3.5 of 800,000. Why would you \"invest\" in a 1.7 insurance policy when you are paying a \"low\" 3.5 mortgage? I would take as much cash as you are comfortable with and pay down the mortgage as much as possible, and get it paid off quickly. Then you dont need life insurance. Then you can do whatever you want.

The card company that is getting the extra business knows that you are paying off big bills each month and keeping your account in good standing, and they will likely offer you a credit increase all by themselves because they want to keep your business. If no offer is forthcoming, you can call the card company and ask for a credit increase.

    "body": "After seeing your most recent comment on the original question, it looks like others have answered the question you intended, and described the extreme difficulty of getting the timing right the way youre trying to. Since Ive already typed it up, what follows answers what I originally thought your question was, which was asking if there were drawbacks to investing entirely in money market funds to avoid stock volatility altogether. Money market funds have the significant drawback that they offer low returns. One of the fundamental principles in finance is that there is a tradeoff between low risk and high returns. While money market funds are extremely stable, their returns are paltry under current market conditions, you can consider them roughly equivalent to cash. On the other hand, though investing in stocks puts your money on a roller coaster, returns will be, on average, substantially higher. Since people often invest in order to achieve personal financial stability, many feel naturally attracted to very stable investments like money market funds. However, this tendency can be a big mistake. The higher returns of the stock market dont merely serve to stoke an investors greed, they are necessary for achieving most peoples financial goals. For example, consider two hypothetical investors, saving for retirement over the course of a 40year career. The first investor, apprehensive Adam, invests 10k per year in a money market fund. The second investor, brave Barbara, invests 10k per year in an SP 500 index fund reinvesting dividends. Lets be generous and say that Adams money market fund keeps pace with inflation in reality, they typically dont even do that. At the end of 40 years, in todays money, Adam will have 10,00040  400,000, not nearly enough to retire comfortably on. On the other hand, lets assume that Barbara gets returns of 7 per year after inflation, which is typical though not guaranteed. Barbara will then have, using the formula for the future value of an annuity, 10,000  [1.0740  1]  0.07, or about 2,000,000, which is much more comfortable. While Adams strategy produces nearly guaranteed results, those results are actually guaranteed failure. Barbaras strategy is not a guarantee, but it has a good chance of producing a comfortable retirement. Even if her timing isnt great, over these time scales, the chances that she will have more money than Adam in the end are very high. I wont produce a technical analysis of this claim, as its a bit complicated. Do more research if youre interested."

See this article for the mexican case, the introduction has a list of other articles you could read on the subject. In some cases parity doesnt seem to be reached, which may have to do with transaction costs, the risk of transacting in a foreign market, as well as administrative  legal concerns that can affect the direct holder of a foreign share but dont impact the ADR holder since those risks and costs are borne by the institution, which presumably has a better idea of how to manage such risks and costs. Its also worth pointing out that there are almost always arbitrage opportunities that get snapped up quickly the law of one price doesnt apply for very short timeframes, just that if youre not an expert in that particular domain of the market, it might as well be a law since you wont see the arbitrage opportunities fast enough. That is to say, there are always opportunities for arbitrage with ADRs but chances are YOU wont be able to take advantage of it In the Mexican case, the price divergence seems to have an average halflife of 3 days. Some price divergence might be expected ADR holders shouldnt be expected to know as much about the foreign market as the typical foreign share holder, and that uncertainty may also cause some divergence. There does seem to be some opportunity for arbitrage doing what you suggest in markets where it is not legally possible to short shares, but that likely is the value added from being able to short a share that belongs to a market where you cant do that."

So there isnt as much time to shop around as when you do a refinance. I disagree with the sentiment to go with your local bank. Nothing wrong with asking at your local bank and using their numbers as a baseline, but chances are they wont be competitive. There are many reputable online mortgage originators that will show accurate fees and rates upfront assuming you provide accurate information. In the past there were a lot of issue with Good Faith Estimates being pretty much worthless. There were a fair number of horror stories about people showing up to closing and finding out fee or rates had increased dramatically. There was a law passed after the housing debacle that severely limits the shenanigans that lenders can do at closing and so there is less risk when going with a lesser known lender. In fact I would say the only real risk with a lender now days is choosing one that happens to be overloaded and or just has poor customer service in general. Personally I have found the most competitive rates from Zillows mortgage service and the now defunct Google mortgage. The lenders tend to be smaller, but highly efficient. They are very much dependent on their online reputations. I have heard good things about a number of larger online lenders, but I dont have personal experience so I will leave them off. I personally wouldnt worry much about whether the loan is sold or not. Outside of refinancing I dont think I have ever talked to the bank servicing my mortgage about my mortgage. There just isnt much need to talk to them."

    "body": "Both states will want to tax you. Your tax home is where you maintain a domicile, are registered to vote, etc. and you will probably want to keep this as MA since you state that MA is your permanent residence and you are staying in a rented place in PA. But be careful about voter registration that is one of the items that can be used to determine your state of residence. OK, so if you and your spouse are MA residents, you should file jointly as residents in MA and as nonresidents in PA. Do the calculations on the nonresident return first, and then the calculations on the resident return. Typically, on a nonresident tax return, the calculations are effectively the following Report all your income usually AGI from the Federal return. Call this X. Compute the PA state tax due on X. Note that you follow the rules for nonresidents in doing this, not the calculations used by PA residents. Call the amount of tax you computed as Y. What part of the total income X is attributable to PA sources? If this amount is Z, then you owe PA Y times ZX. On the resident return in MA, you will likely get some credit for the taxes paid to PA, and this will reduce your MA tax burden. Usually the maximum credit is limited to the lesser of actual tax paid to PA and what you would have had to pay MA for the same income. As far as withholding is concerned, your employer in PA will withhold PA taxes as if you are a PA resident, but you can adjust the amount via the PA equivalent of IRS Form W4 so as to account for any additional tax that might be due because you will be filing as a nonresident. Else you can pay estimated taxes via the PA equivalent of IRS Form 1040ES. Similarly, your wife can adjust her withholding to account for the MA taxes that you will owe on the joint income, or you can pay estimated taxes to MA too. Note that it is unlikely that your employer in Pennsylvania will withhold Massachusetts taxes and send them to Massachusetts for you, e.g. if it is a maandpa store, but there may be special deals available if your employer does business in both states, i.e. is a MAandPA store."

And I see intelligent answers advising you against 1. But I dont believe these are the only choices. My 401k has an SP fund, a short term bond fund, and about 8 other choices including foreign, small cap, etc. I may be mistaken, but I thought regulations forced more choices. From the 2 choices, SP and short term bond, I can create a stock bond mix to my liking. With respect to the 2 answers here, I agree, 100 might not be wise, but 50 stock may be too little. Moving to such a conservative mix too young, and youll see lower returns. I like your plan to shift more conservative as you approach retirement. Edit  in response to the disclosure of the fees  1.18 for Aggressive, .96 for Moderate I wrote an article 5 years back, Are you 401koed in which I discuss the level of fees that result in my suggestion to not deposit above the match. Clearly, any fee above .90 would quickly erode the average tax benefit one might expect. I also recommend you watch a PBS Frontline episode titled The Retirement Gamble It makes the point as well as I can, if not better. The benefit of a 401k aside from the match which you should never pass up is the ability to take advantage of the difference in your marginal tax rate at retirement vs when earned. For the typical taxpayer, this means working and taking those deposits at the 25 bracket, and in retirement, withdrawing at 15. When you invest in a fund with a fee above 1, you can see it will wipe out the difference over time. An investor can pay .05 for the VOO ETF, paying as much over an investing lifetime, say 50 years, as you will pay in just over 2 years. They jumped on you?

Here is an idea to investigate Could you sell the company, and thereby turn the profits that are taxed as ordinary income into a longterm capital gain taxed at 15, plus state income tax, if any? You can determine the value of a profitable business using discounted cash flow analysis, even if you expect that the revenue stream will dry up due to product obsolescence or expiry of licensing agreements. To avoid the capital gains taxes especially if you live in a hightax state like California, you could also transfer the stock to a Charitable Remainder Trust. The CRT then sells the shares to the thirdparty acquirer, invests the proceeds and pays you annual distributions similar to an annuity. The flip side of a sale is that now the acquiring party will be stuck with the taxes payable on your companys profits while being forced to amortize the purchase price over multiple years  15, if I recall correctly, which will factor into the valuation. However, it is likely that the acquirer has better ways to mitigate the tax impact e.g. the acquirer is a company currently operating at a loss, and therefore can cancel out the tax liabilities from your companys profits. One final caveat Dont let the tax tail wag the business dog. In other words, focus your energies on extracting the maximum value from your company, rather than trying to find convoluted tax saving strategies. You might find that making an extra dollar in profits is easier than saving fifty cents in taxes."

The following table illustrates the values in each of those funds with the rebalancing transactions This second table shows what that same money would look like without any rebalancing over those years Obviously this is cherrypicking for the biggest drop weve recently experienced, but even if you skipped 2008 and 2009, the increase for a rebalanced portfolio from 20102017 is 85 verses 54 for the portfolio that is not being rebalanced in the same period. This is also a plenty conservative portfolio. You can see that a 100 stock portfolio dropped 40 in 2008, but the combined portfolio only dropped 18. A 100 stock portfolio has gained 175 since 2009, compared to 105 for the balanced portfolio, but its common to trade gains for safety as you get closer to retirement. You didnt ask about a 100 stock portfolio in your initial question. These results would be repeated in many other portfolio allocations because some asset classes outperform others one year, then underperform the next. You sell after the years it outperforms, then you buy after years that it underperforms."

    "body": "Certainly there are people who do pay off their homes. Others do not. Its a question of risk tolerance and preference. Some considerations relevant to this question Taxes  Interest on a mortgage is tax deductible. Particularly for high earners, this is a significant incentive to maintain a mortgage balance and place extra money in the market instead. Liquidity  If you lose your job, you can sell stocks to pay the mortgage. But if you have made principle payments on your mortgage but still owe some outstanding balance, you are still required to make monthly payments without any source of income. Rates  In recent years it is been common to get a mortgage for 3.2 to 3.5. The difference between those rates and 9 rate of return for the market is substantial. There are other considerations but the answer in the end is that for many people the risk  reward calculus says the 5 difference in rate of return is worth the potential risks."

Its current worth about what we paid for it 9 years ago. But I dont care at all because I will likely never sell it. That house is worth about 110,000 but rents for 1500 per month. It is a good investment. If you take rental income and the increase in equity from paying down the mortgage subtracting maintenance the return on the down payment is very good. I havent mentioned the paper losses involved in depreciation as thats fairly US specific the laws are different in other jurisdictions but for at least the first two years we showed losses while making money. So there are tax advantages as well at least currently, those laws also change over time. There is a large difference between investing in a property for appreciation and investing for income. Even in those categories there are niches that can vary widely commercial vs residential, trendy, vacationtourist areas, etc. Each has their place, but ensure that you dont confuse a truism meant for one type of real estate investing as being applicable to real estate investing in general."

Look for economic development perks of the new jurisdiction. Many states have some kind of formal tax credit for people that start business or buy in certain areas, but MONEY TALKS and you can make an individual arrangement with any agency, municipality etc. If the secretary at city hall doesnt know about a prepackaged formal arrangement that is offered to citizens, then ask for the \"expedited development package\" which generally has a \"processing fee\" involved.

    "body": "What littleadv said is correct. His worth is based on the presumed worth of the total company value which is much greater than all investment dollars combined because of valuation growth. In other words, his \"worth\" is based on the potential return for his share of ownership at a rate based on the latest valuation of the company. He is worth 17.5 billion today, but the total funding for Facebook is only 2.4 billion? I dont understand this. In private companies, valuations typically come from either speculationanalysts or from investments. Investment valuations are the better gauge, because actual money traded hands for a percentage ownership. However, just as with public companies on the stock market, there are at least two caveats. Just because someone else sold their shares at a given rate, doesnt mean that rate... In both cases, its possible the value may be much lower or much higher. Some highvalue purchases surprise for how high they are, such as Microsofts acquisition of Skype for 8.5 billion. The formula for one owners \"worth\" based on a given acquisition is Valuation  Acquisition amount  Acquisition percent Worth  Owners percent  Valuation According to Wikipedia Zuckerberg owns 24. In January, Goldman Sachs invested 500 million at a 50 billion valuation. That is the latest investment and puts Zuckerbergs worth at 12 billion. However, some speculation places a Facebook IPO at a much higher valuation, such as as 100 billion. I dont know what your reference is for 17 billion, but it puts their valuation at 70.8 billion, between the January Goldman valuation and current IPO speculation.  For instance, Eduardo Saverin originally invested 10,000, which, at his estimated 5 ownership, would now be worth 35 billion."

    "body": "I finally found it! Johnson Controls International PLC FORM 8KA Amended Current report filing Filed 100316 for the Period Ending 090216 from httpinvestors.johnsoncontrols.comfinancialinformationjohnsonsecfilings, says on page II6 my emphasis for the relevant paragraph On September 2, 2016, Johnson Controls and Tyco completed their combination pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2016, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of July 1, 2016, by and among Johnson Controls, Tyco and certain other parties named therein, including Jagara Merger Sub LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco Merger Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on September 2, 2016, Merger Sub merged with and into Johnson Controls with Johnson Controls being the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Tyco the merger. Following the merger, Tyco changed its name to Johnson Controls International plc. Immediately prior to the merger and in connection therewith, Tyco shareholders received 0.955 ordinary shares of Tyco which shares are now referred to as combined company ordinary shares for each Tyco ordinary share they held by virtue of a 0.955forone share consolidation. In the merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value 1.00 per share, of Johnson Controls Johnson Controls common stock other than shares held by Johnson Controls, Tyco and certain of their subsidiaries was converted into the right to receive either the cash consideration or the share consideration each as described below, at the election of the holder, subject to proration procedures described in the Merger Agreement and applicable withholding taxes. The election to receive the cash consideration was undersubscribed. As a result, holders of shares of Johnson Controls common stock that elected to receive the share consideration and holders of shares of Johnson Controls common stock that made no election or failed to properly make an election became entitled to receive, for each such share of Johnson Controls common stock, 5.7293 in cash, without interest, and 0.8357 combined company ordinary shares, subject to applicable withholding taxes. Holders of shares of Johnson Controls common stock that elected to receive the cash consideration became entitled to receive, for each such share of Johnson Controls common stock, 34.88 in cash, without interest, subject to applicable withholding taxes. In the merger, Johnson Controls shareholders received, in the aggregate, approximately 3.864 billion in cash. Immediately after the closing of, and giving effect to, the merger, former Johnson Controls shareholders owned approximately 56 of the issued and outstanding combined company ordinary shares and former Tyco stockholders owned approximately 44 of the issued and outstanding combined company ordinary shares. This answers what actually happened in the transaction as far as my cost basis in the new JCI, its a little more obscure on page II7 it says For pro forma purposes, the valuation of consideration transferred is based on, amongst other things, the adjusted share price of Johnson Controls on September 2, 2016 of 47.67 per share and on page II8 Johnson Controls adjusted share price as of September 2, 2016 2 47.67 2 Amount equals Johnson Control closing share price and market capitalization at September 2, 2016 45.45 and 29,012 million, respectively adjusted for the Tyco 3,864 million cash contribution used to purchase 110.8 million shares of Johnson Controls stock for 34.88 per share. and both agree with the information posted at httpwww.secinfo.comdpdtb.w6n.2n.htm1stPage R66 Merger Transaction Fair Value of Consideration Transferred Details which I cant seem to find on an \"official\" website but it purports to post from the SEC EDGAR database. So for each share of JCI, it had a fair value of 47.67 prior to the acquisition, and transformed into 5.7293 in cash, plus 0.8357 of \"new\" JCI shares with a basis of 47.67  5.7293  41.9407. Stated in terms of \"new\" JCI shares, this is 50.1863 41.94070.8357 per \"new\" JCI share. Im not really 100 sure of this calculation though. I also found JCIs Form 8937 which states Fair market value generally is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the facts. U.S. federal income tax law does not specifically prescribe how former JCI shareholders should determine the fair market value of the Tyco ordinary shares received in the merger. One possible method of determining the fair market value of one Tyco ordinary share is to use the average of the high and low trading prices on the date of the merger, which was 45.69. Other methods for determining the fair market value of Tyco ordinary shares are possible. Former JCI shareholders are not bound by the approach described above and may, in consultation with their tax advisors, use another approach. as well as similar text on the IRS website One possible method of determining the fair market value of one Tyco ordinary share is to use the average of the high and low trading prices on the date of the merger, which was 45.69. Using this figure, former JCI shareholders that elected to receive shares in the merger would receive cash and Tyco ordinary shares worth approximately 43.91 per share of JCI common stock exchanged in the merger assuming no cash received in lieu of fractional shares."

Specifically deficits forced them to in the later part of the war The Conservatives opposed income tax as they wanted to attract immigrants primarily from the United Kingdom and the United States, as opposed to Eastern Europe, and they wanted to give their preferred choice of newcomers some incentive to come to Canada. Wartime expenses forced the Tories to reconsider their options and in 1917 the wartime government imposed a \"temporary\" income tax to cover expenses. Despite the new tax the Canadian government ran up considerable debts during the war and were unable to forego income tax revenue after the war ended. With the election of the Mackenzie Kingled Liberal government, much of the National Policy was dismantled and income tax has remained in place ever since.

First off, many investors buy options to hedge against a current position in a stock already own the stock. But you can also try to make money off of options rather than protecting yourself. Lets suppose you anticipate that a stock will increase in value so you want to capitalize on this. Suppose further that you have a small amount of money to invest, say 100. Suppose the stock is currently at 100 so that you can only afford 1 share. Suppose there is a call option out there with strike 105 that costs you only 1. Lets compare two scenarios The stock increases to 120 at the maturity date of the option. So, you made a lot more money with the same initial investment. The amount of money you put in is small i.e. can be perceived as low risk. However, if the stock price ended up being 104.90 then your options are worthless i.e. can be perceived as high risk. HTH."

If the price asked is too high to be justified by current guesses, nobody buys. That sets the upper limit at any given time. Since some of this is guesswork, the market is not completely rational. Prices can drop after good news if theyd been inflated by the expectation of better news, for example. In general, businesses which dont crash tend to grow.

Your employer will automatically withhold 7.65 of payroll taxes as they pay you each paycheck and then theyll automatically pay the other half of your payroll tax an additional 7.65 to bring it to a total of 15.3. In other words, because your wife is technically self employed, she will owe both sides of payroll tax which is 15.3 of 38k  5,800 on TOP of your federal income tax which is the only thing the W4 is instructing them about what amount to withhold. The huge advantage to a 1099, however, is that shes essentially selfemployed which means ALL of the things she needs to run her business are deductible expenses. This includes her car, computer, home office, supplies, sometimes phone, gas, maintenance, travel expenses, sometimes entertainment, etc  which can easily bring her \"income\" down from 38k to lets say 23k, reducing both her federal income tax AND selfemployment tax to apply to 15k less saving lets say 50 of 15k  7.5k with federal and self employment because your income is so high. She is actually supposed to pay quarterly taxes to make up for all of this. The easy way to do this is each quarter plug YOUR total salary  bonus and the tax YOU have paid so far check your paystubs into TurboTax along with her income so far and all of her expenses. This will give you how much tax you can expect to have left to owe so farthis would be your first quarter. When you calculate your other quarters, do it the exact same way and just subtract what youve already paid so far that year from your total tax liability."

    "header": "Does U.S. tax code call for small business owners to count business purchases as personal income?",
    "body": "It sounds like something is getting lost in translation here. A business owner should not have to pay personal income tax on business expenses, with the caveat that they are truly business expenses. Heres an example where what you described could happen Suppose a business has 200K in revenue, and 150K in legitimate business expenses wages and owner salaries, taxes, services, productsgoods, etc. The profit for this example business is 50K. Depending on how the business is structured sole proprietor, llc, scorp, etc, the business owners may have to pay personal income tax on the 50K in profit. If the owner then decided to have the business purchase a new vehicle solely for personal use with, say, 25K of that profit, then the owner may think he could avoid paying income tax on 25K of the 50K. However, this would not be considered a legitimate business expense, and therefore would have to be reclassified as personal income and would be taxed as if the 25K was paid to the owner. If the vehicle truly was used for legitimate business purposes then the business expenses would end up being 175K, with 25K left as profit which is taxable to the owners. Note this is an oversimplification as its oftentimes the case that vehicles are partially used for business instead of all or nothing. In fact, large items such as vehicles are typically depreciated so the full purchase price could not be deducted in a single year. If many of the purchases are depreciated items instead of deductions, then this could explain why it appears that the business expenses are being taxed. Its not a tax on the expense, but on the income that hasnt been reduced by expenses, since only a portion of the big ticket item can be treated as an expense in a single year."

    "header": "Is it legal if Im managing my familys entire wealth?",
    "body": "My answer is with respect to the United States. I have no idea about Indias regulatory environment. You are opening yourself up to massive liabilities and problems if you deposit their money in your account. I managed investment accounts as a private investment advisor for years those with less than 15 clients were not required to register until DoddFrank changed the rules. Thus you would have to register as an advisor, probably needing to take the series 65 exam or qualifying some other way, e.g. getting your CFPCFAetc.... I used a discount brokerdealer Scottrade as the custodian. Heres how it works Each clients account was their own account, and I had a master account that allowed me to bill their accounts and manage them. They signed paperwork making me the advisor on their account. I had very little accounting to handle aside from tracking basis for taxed accounts. If you take custody of the money, youll have regulatory obligations. There are always lots of stories in the financial advisor trade publications about advisors who go to jail for screwing their clients. The most common factor they took custody of the assets. I understand why you want a single account  you want to ensure that each client gets the same results, right? Does each client want the same results? Certainly the tax situation for each is different, yes? Perhaps one has gains and wants to take losses in one year, and the other doesnt. If their accounts are managed separately, one can take losses while the other realizes gains to offset other losses. Financial advisors offer these kinds of accounts as Separately Managed Accounts SMAs. The advisors on these kinds of accounts are mutual funds managers, and they try to match a target portfolio, but they can do things like realize gains or losses for clients if their tax situation would prefer it. You certainly cant let them put retirement accounts into your single account unless the IRS has you on their list of acceptable custodians. I suggest that you familiarize yourself thoroughly with the regulatory environment that you want to operate under. Then, after examining the pros and cons, you should decide which route you want to take. I think the most direct and feasible route is to pass the Series 65, register as an investment advisor, and find a custodian who will let you manage the assets as the advisor on the account. Real estate is another matter, you should talk to an attorney, not some random guy on the internet even if he has an MBA and a BS in Real Estate, which I do. This is very much a state law thing."

    "header": "Are RSUs ever taxed as long term capital gains?",
    "body": "I dont know the legal framework for RSUs, so Im not sure what is mandatory and what is chosen by the company issuing them. I recently reviewed one companies offering and it basically looked like a flat purchase of stock on the VEST date. So even if I got a zillion shares for 1 GRANTED to me, if it was 100 shares that vested at 100 on the 1st, then I would owe tax on the market value on the day of vest. Further, the company would withhold 25 of the VEST for federal taxes and 10 for state taxes, if I lived in a state with income tax. The withholding rate was flat, regardless of what my actual tax rate was. Capital gains on the change from the market value on the VEST date was calculated as shortterm or longterm based on the time since the VEST date. So if my 100 shares went up to 120, I would pay the 20 difference as short term or long term based on how long I had owned them since the VEST. That said, I dont know if this is universal. Your HR folks should be able to help answer at least some of these questions, though I know their favorite response when they dont know is that you should consult a tax professional. Good luck."

    "header": "Ongoing things to do and read to improve knowledge of finance?",
    "body": "Im another programmer, I guess we all just like complicated things, or got here via stackoverflow. Obligatory tedious but accurate point Investing is not personal finance, in fact its maybe one of the less important parts of it. See this answer Where to start with personal finance? Obligatory warning for software developer type minds getting into investing because its complicated and therefore fun is a really awful idea from a financial perspective. Or see behavioral finance research on how analyticalprofessionalcreative type people are often terrible at investing, while eventempered practical people are better. The thing with investing is that inaction is better than action, tried and true is better than creative, and simple is better than complicated. So if youre like me and many programmers and like creative, complicated action  not good for the wallet. Youve been warned. That said.  Stuff I read In general I hate reading too much financial information because I think it makes me take illadvised actions. The actions I most need to take have to do with my career and my spending patterns. So I try to focus on reading about software development, for example. Or I answer questions on this site, which at least might help someone out, and I enjoy writing. For basic financial news and research, I prefer Morningstar.com, especially if you get the premium version. The writing has more depth, its often from qualified financial analysts, and with the paid version you get data and analysis on thousands of funds and stocks, instead of a small number as with Motley Fool newsletters. I dont follow Morningstar regularly anymore, instead I use it for research when I need to pick funds in a 401k or whatever. Another caveat on Morningstar is that the \"star ratings\" on funds are dumb. Look at the Analyst Picks and the analyst writeups instead. I just flipped through my RSS reader and I have 2030 financerelated blogs in there collecting unread posts. It looks like the only one I regularly read is httpalephblog.com which is sort of random. But I find David Merkel very thoughtful and interesting. Hes also a conservative without being a partisan hack, and posts frequently. I read the weekly market comment at httphussmanfunds.com as well. Most weeks it says the market is overvalued, so thats predictable, but the interesting part is the rationale and the other ideas he talks about. I read a lot of softwarerelated blogs and theres some bleed into finance, especially from the VC world blogs like httpwww.avc.com or httpbhorowitz.com or whatever. Anyway I spend most of my reading time on careerrelated stuff and I think this is also the correct decision from a financial perspective. If you were a doctor, youd be better off reading about doctoring, too. I read financerelated books fairly often, I guess there are other threads listing ideas on that front. I prefer books about principles rather than a barrage of daily financial news and questionable ideas. Other than that, I keep up with headlines, just reading the paper every day including businessrelated topics is good enough. If theres some big event in the financial markets, itll show up in the regular paper. Take a class I initially learned about finance by reading a pile of books and alongside that taking the CFP course and the first CFA course. Both are probably equivalent to about a college semester worth of work, but you can plow through them in a couple months each if you focus. You can just do the class and take the exam if you like, without having to go on and actually get the work experience and the certifications. I didnt go on to do that. This sounds like a crazy thing to do, and it kind of is, but I think its also sort of crazy to expect to be competent on a topic without taking some courses or otherwise getting pretty deep into the material. If youre a normal person and dont have time to take finance courses, youre likely better off either keeping it supersimple, or else outsourcing if you can find the right advisor What exactly can a financial advisor do for me, and is it worth the money? When its inevitably complex e.g. as you approach retirement then an advisor is best. My mom is retiring soon and I found her a professional, for example. I like having a lot of knowledge myself, because its just the only way I could feel comfortable. So for sure I understand other people wanting to have it too. But what Id share from the other side is that once you have it, the conclusion is that you dont have enough knowledge or time to do anything fancy anyway, and that the simple answers are fine. Check out httpwww.amazon.comSmartSimpleFinancialStrategiesPeopledp0743269942 Investing for fun isnt investing for profit Many people recommend Motley Fool I see two on this question already!. The site isnt evil, but the problem in my opinion is that it promotes an attitude toward and a style of investing that isnt objectively justifiable for practical reasons. Essentially I dont think optimizing for making money and optimizing for having fun coexist very well. If investing is your chosen hobby rather than fishing or knitting, then Motley Fool can be fun with their tone and discussion forums, but other people in forums are just going to make you go wrong moneywise see behavioral finance research again. Talking to others isnt compatible with ice in your decisionmaking veins. Also, Motley Fool tends to pervasively make it sound like active investing is easier than it is. Theres a reason the Chartered Financial Analyst curriculum is a few reams of paper plus 4 years of work experience, rather than reading blogs. Practical investing \"just buy the target date fund\" can be super easy, but once you go beyond that, its not. I dont really agree with the \"anyone can do it and its not work!\" premise, any more than I think that about lawyering or doctoring or computer programming. After 15 years Im a programming expert after some courses and a lot of reading, Im not someone who could professionally run an activelymanaged portfolio. I think most of us need to have the fun part separate from the serious cash part. Maybe literally distinct accounts that you keep at separate brokerages. Or just do something else for fun, besides investing. Morningstar has this problem too, and finance.yahoo.com, and Bloomberg, I mean, they are all interested in making you think about investing a lot more than you ought to. They all have an incentive to convince you that the latest headlines make a difference, when they dont. Bottom line, I dont think personal finance changes very quickly the details of specific mutual funds change, and theres always some new twist in the tax code, but the big picture is pretty stable. I think going indepth say, read the Chartered Financial Analyst curriculum materials would teach you a lot more than reading blogs frequently. The most important things to work on are income career and spending to maximize income minus spending. Thats where time investment will pay off. I know its annoying to argue the premise of the question rather than answering, but I did try to mention a couple things to read somewhere in there "

Any attempt to finance through a loan would put you into a debt trap you wont ever dig yourself out. And if there are any car dealerships in your country which claim otherwise, run away fast. Jon Oliver from Last Week tonight made a video about business practices of car dealerships in the United States which sell cars on loans to people who cant afford them a while ago. As usual When a deal seems too good to be true, it generally isnt true at all. After a few months, the victims customers usually end up with no car but lots of outstanding debt they pay off for years. So how do you tell if you can afford a car or not? A new car usually lives for about 1020 years. So when you want to calculate the monthly cost of owning a new car, divide the price by 120. But thats just the price for buying the vehicle, not for actually driving it. Cars cost additional money each month for gas, repairs, insurance, taxes etc. these costs depend a lot on your usage pattern and location, so I can not provide you with any numbers for that. If you have less disposable income per month as in \"money you currently have left at the end of each month\" than monthly cost of purchase plus expected monthly running costs, you can not afford the car.

As far as large payments go, there are two reasons they might be reported to the government taxes, and criminal investigations. For tax purposes, if the payment is considered a salary or wage that is, you are an employee of the company and the payment is for your time working there, then the company paying you is responsible for reporting the wage and withholding applicable taxes from your salary. If you are considered an independent contract employee, then you yourself will be responsible for reporting the income to the IRS and paying the applicable taxes yourself. In the second case, unless you are already under investigation, I wouldnt worry about it. Banks are very touchy about financial records being kept private, and wont release them without a subpoena. One caveat is that this is under US law. Banks which maintain branches in multiple countries must, of course, comply with all local laws in the jurisdiction where they do business. The take away from this is that Bank of America is unlikely to report a single deposit of 75,000 into your account to anyone on their own. If it is a paper check being deposited they will probably place a hold on it to make sure it clears, but that is all."

    "body": "Option prices consist of two parts the intrinsic value the difference between the strike and the current price of the stock and a time premium, representing the probability that the stock will end up above the strike for a call or below for a put. All else being equal, options decline in value as time passes, since there is less uncertainty about the expected value of the stock at expiration and thus the time premium is smaller. Theta is the measure of the change in value in one day. So for every day that passes, the calls you sold are going down by 64.71 which is positive to you since you sold them at a higher value and the calls you sold are going down by 49.04. So your position a short spread is gaining 15.67 each day assuming no change in stock price or volatility. In reality, the stock price and volatility also change every day, and those are much stronger drivers of the value of your options. In your case, however, the options are deep out of the money, meaning its very likely that theyll expire worthless, so all you have left is time premium, which is decaying as time goes on."

Profiting from information on the stock market that some people have and some cant have is considered \"unfair\", since it presumably excludes the latter from profitmaking opportunities and thus makes their trades less profitable than otherwise. Since it is universally felt so, people made laws that prohibit such behavior.

Doesnt the fact that investors can consistently underperform the market by making poor decisions, imply that an investor could consistently outperform the market by making the opposite decisions? No. If my investment decisions cause me to earn only a 10 return compared to the \"average\" 12 return, then making the opposite decision will cause me to lose 10, not to make 14."

    "header": "If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?",
    "body": "This is an excellent question, one that Ive pondered before as well. Heres how Ive reconciled it in my mind. Why should we agree that a stock is worth anything? After all, if I purchase a share of said company, I own some small percentage of all of its assets, like land, capital equipment, accounts receivable, cash and securities holdings, etc., as others have pointed out. Notionally, that seems like it should be \"worth\" something. However, that doesnt give me the right to lay claim to them at will, as Im just a very small minority shareholder. The old adage says that \"something is only worth what someone is willing to pay you for it.\" That share of stock doesnt actually give me any liquid control over the companys assets, so why should someone else be willing to pay me something for it? As you noted, one reason why a stock might be attractive to someone else is as a potentially taxadvantaged revenue stream via dividends. Especially in this lowinterestrate environment, this might well exceed that which I might obtain in the bond market. The payment of income to the investor is one way that a stock might have some \"inherent value\" that is attractive to investors. As you asked, though, what if the stock doesnt pay dividends? As a small shareholder, whats in it for me? Without any dividend payments, theres no regular method of receiving my invested capital back, so why should I, or anyone else, be willing to purchase the stock to begin with? I can think of a couple reasons Expectation of a future dividend. You may believe that at some point in the future, the company will begin to pay a dividend to investors. Dividends are paid as a percentage of a companys total profits, so it may make sense to purchase the stock now, while there is no dividend, banking on growth during the nodividend period that will result in even higher capital returns later. This kind of skirts your question a nondividendpaying stock might be worth something because it might turn into a dividendpaying stock in the future. Expectation of a future acquisition. This addresses the original premise of my argument above. If I cant, as a small shareholder, directly access the assets of the company, why should I attribute any value to that small piece of ownership? Because some other entity might be willing to pay me for it in the future. In the event of an acquisition, I will receive either cash or another companys shares in compensation, which often results in a capital gain for me as a shareholder. If I obtain a capital gain via cash as part of the deal, then this proves my point the original, nondividendpaying stock was worth something because some other entity decided to acquire the company, paying me more cash than I paid for my shares. They are willing to pay this price for the company because they can then reap its profits in the future. If I obtain a capital gain via stock in as part of the deal, then the process restarts in some sense. Maybe the new stock pays dividends. Otherwise, perhaps the new company will do something to make its stock worth more in the future, based on the same future expectations. The fact that ownership in a stock can hold such positive future expectations makes them \"worth something\" at any given time if you purchase a stock and then want to sell it later, someone else is willing to purchase it from you so they can obtain the right to experience a positive capital return in the future. While stock valuation schemes will vary, both dividends and acquisition prices are related to a companys profits This provides a connection between a companys profitability, expectations of future growth, and its stock price today, whether it currently pays dividends or not."

    "header": "How much cash on hand should one have?",
    "body": "There are two or three issues here. One is, how quickly can you get cash out of your investments? If you had an unexpected expense, if you suddenly needed more cash than you have on hand, how long would it take to get money out of your Scott Trade account or wherever it is? I have a TD Ameritrade account which is pretty similar, and it just takes a couple of days to get money out. Im hard pressed to think of a time when I literally needed a bunch of cash TODAY with no advance warning. What sudden bills is one likely to have? A medical bill, perhaps. But hey, just a few weeks ago I had to go to the emergency room with a medical problem, and its not like they demanded cash on the table before theyd help me. I just got the bill, maybe 3 weeks after the event. Ive never decided to move and then actually moved 2 days later. These things take SOME planning. Etc. Second, how much risk are you willing to tolerate? If you have your money in the stock market, the market could go down just as you need the cash. Thats not even a worst case scenario, extreme scenario. After all, if the economy gets bad, the stock market could go down, and the same fact could result in your employer laying you off. That said, you could reduce this risk by keeping some of your money in a lowrisk investment, like some highquality bonds. Third, you want to have cash to cover the more modest, routine expenses. Like make sure you always have enough cash on hand to pay the rent or mortgage, buy food, and so on. And fourth, you want to keep a cushion against bookkeeping mistakes. Ive had twice in my life that Ive overdrawn a checking account, not because I was broke, but because I messed up my records and thought I had more money in the account than I really did. Its impossible to give exact numbers without knowing a lot about your income and expenses. But for myself I keep a cushion of 1,000 to 1,5000 in my checking account, on top of all regular bills that I know Ill have to pay in the next month, to cover modest unexpected expenses and mistakes. I pay most of my bills by credit card for convenience and pay the balance in full when I get the bill so I dont pay interest  so I dont need a lot of cushion. I used to keep 2 to 3 months pay in an account invested in bonds and very safe stocks, something that wouldnt lose much value even in bad times. Since my daughter started college Ive run this down to less than 1 months pay, and instead of replacing that money Im instead putting my spare money into more general stocks, which is admittedly riskier. So between the two accounts I have a little over 2 months pay, which I think is low, but as I say, Im trying to get my kids through college so Ive run down my savings some. I think if I had more than 6 months pay in easilyliquidated assets, then unless I expected to need a bunch of cash for something, buying a new house or some such, Id be transferring that to a retirement account with tax advantages."

    "body": "It is going to save you more money in the long run to pay at once with cash. If you take out a loan, you will pay interest on the balance, costing you money. If you pay off the balance immediately, there is no difference between the options and your question becomes irrelevant. There is no credit rating benefit to placing large purchases on your cards, especially since your credit is fine. My advice is to pay in cash in this case, mostly because it makes you feel the purchase. This is what you are describing in your question. This instinct helps you recognize potential problems, instead of masking them with debt. Questions like \"Do I need this?\" \"Am I overextending myself financially with this purchase?\" \"Am I holding enough cashonhand for emergencies?\" You may be fine in these areas, but I would still argue that cash makes you a better buyer because the expense feels much more significant, making you more cautious and discerning. You are right to feel these things before dropping a large sum of money. Let it inform you and help you make better decisions. Dont mask it or be paralyzed by it!"

    "body": "Most corporations have a limit on the number of shares that they can issue, which is written into their corporate charter. They usually sell a number that is fewer than the maximum authorized number so that they have a reserve for secondary offerings, employee incentives, etc. In a scrip dividend, the company is distributing authorized shares that were not previously issued. This reduces the number of shares that it has to sell in the future to raise capital, so it reduces the assets of the company. In a split, every share including the authorized shares that havent been distributed are divided. This results in more total shares which then trade at a price thats roughly proportional to the split, but it does not reduce the assets of the company."

    "body": "It is my understanding that banks pay less than the going rate on savings accounts and require that the person who takes out a loan pay more than the going rate. That is how the bank gets its money. Usually the going rate is affected by the current inflation rate but that has not been true for the last few weeks. So that means that, typically, the money you have in the bank is, gradually, losing purchasing power as the bank typically pays you less than the inflation rate. So if you want your money to keep pace with inflation or do a bit better then you should buy bonds."

Now if you were obliged to make periodic loan repayments say in amount of 1 for n number of periods. Then the present value of all such periodic payment is the \"Principal\" or amount you borrowed. This is the sum of discounted periodic payments as if we replace 11i with x then this turns out to be geometric series of the form This simplifies to replacing 11i for x we get which is the present value of periodic payment in amount of 1 The future value of periodic payments in amount of 1 can be arrived at multiplying the PVIFA by 1in giving Once again the interest is compounded per annum and for intrayear compounding you would have to at first find the annual effective yield AEY to use as the effect rate is the PVIFA and FVIFA calculation for continuous compounding All the calculation discussed thus far did not take inflation into consideration, if we were to adjust the amounts for a growth of g then the present value of a 1 would be as follow Once again you would have to use AEY if compounding frequency of interest is intrayear Now assume that each loan repayment increases or decreases by an extra amount Q per period. To find the present value of series of payments P that increase or decrease per period by an amount Q we would do the following calculations Here and All of these calculations have been available in tadXL addin for finance and incrementally being offered as JavaScript financial functions library tadJS.

Im just going to go over the basic moving parts of trading an upside down car against another financed car because I think youre conflating price and value. Im also going to ignore taxes, and fees, and depreciation. The car has an acquisition cost price then it has a value. You pay the price to obtain this thing, then in the future it is worth what someone else will pay you. When you finance a car you agree to your 10,000 price, then you call up Mr. Bank and agree to pay 10 per year for 5 years on that 10,000. Mr. Banker wires over 10,000 and you drive home in your car. Say in a year you want a different car. This new car has a price of 20,000, and wouldnt you know it theyll even buy your current car from you. Theyll give you 7,000 to trade in your current car. Your current car has a value of 7,000. Youve made 12 payments of 188.71. Of those payments about 460 was interest, you now owe about 8,195 to Mr. Banker. The new dealership needs to send payment to Mr. Banker to get the title for your current car. Theyll send the 7,000 they agreed to pay for your car. Then theyll loan you the additional 1,195 8,195 owed on the car minus 7,000 trade in value. Your loan on the new car will be for 21,195, 20,000 for the new car and 1,195 for the amount you still owed on the old car after the dealership paid you 7,000 for your old car. It doesnt matter what your downpayment was on the old car, it doesnt matter what your payment was before, it doesnt matter what you bought your old car for. All that matters is how much you owe on it today and how much the buyer the dealership is willing to pay you for it. How much of this is \"loss\" is an extremely vague number to derive primarily because your utility of the car has a value. But it could be argued that the 1,195 added on to your new car loan to pay for the old car is lost."

    "body": "First, consider what causes taxes to apply to a mutual fund, index or actively managed. Dividends and capital gains are generally what will be distributed to shareholders given the nature of a mutual fund since the fund itself doesnt pay taxes. For funds held in IRAs or other taxadvantaged accounts, this isnt a concern and thus people may not have this concern for those situations which can account for a lot of investing situations as people may have 401ks and IRAs that hold their investments rather than taxable accounts. Second, there can be taxmanaged funds so there can be cases where a fund is managed with taxes in mind that is worth noting here as what is referenced is a \"Dummies\" link that is making a generalization. For taxable accounts, it may make more sense to have a taxmanaged fund rather than an index fund though Id also argue to be careful of asset allocation as to maintain a purity of style can require selling of stocks that grow too big and thus trigger capital gains,e.g. smallcap and midcap funds that cant hold onto the winners as they would become midcap and largecap instead of representing the proper asset class. A FUND THAT PLAYED IT SAFEAND WAS SORRY would be a Businessweek story from 1998 of an actively managed fund that went mostly to cash and missed the rise of the stock market at that time if you want a specific example of what an actively managed fund can do that an index fund often cannot do.

    "body": "There are two main ways you can make money through shares through dividends and through capital gains. If the company is performing well and increasing profits year after year, its Net Worth will increase, and if the company continues to beat expectations, then over the long term the share price will follow and increase as well. On the other hand, if the company performs poorly, has a lot of debt and is losing money, it may well stop paying dividends. There will be more demand for stocks that perform well than those that perform badly, thus driving the share price of these stocks up even if they dont pay out dividends. There are many market participants that will use different information to make their decisions to buy or sell a particular stock. Some will be long term buy and hold, others will be day traders, and there is everything in between. Some will use fundamentals to make their decisions, others will use charts and technicals, some will use a combination, and others will use completely different information and methods. These different market participants will create demand at various times, thus driving the share price of good companies up over time. The annual returns from dividends are often between 1 and 6, and, in some cases, up to 10. However, annual returns from capital gains can be 20, 50, 100 or more. That is the main reason why people still buy stocks that pay no dividends. It is my reason for buying them too."

The tax advantages of 401k and IRA accounts help increase your wealth, but the most important thing is to start saving at an early age in your career as you are doing and making sure to continue contributing throughout your life. Compound interest serves you well. If you are really concerned that saving for retirement in your situation would equate to putting money away for no good reason, you can do a couple of things Save in a Roth IRA account which does not require minimum distributions when you get past a certain age. Additionally, your contributions only that is, not your interest earnings to a Roth can be withdrawn tax and penalty free at any time while you are under the age of 59.5. And once you are older than that you can take distributions as however you need. Save by investing in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds. You wont get the tax advantages of a retirement account, but you will still benefit from the time value of money. The bonus here is that you can withdraw your money whenever you want without penalty. Both IRA accounts and mutual fundbrokerage accounts will give you a choice of many securities that you can invest in. In comparison, 401k plans below often have limited choices for you. Most people choose to use their companys 401k plan for retirement savings. In general you do not want to be in a position where you have to borrow from your 401k. As such its not a great option for savings that you think youd need before you retire. Additionally 401k plans have minimum distributions, so you will have to periodically take some money from the account when you are in retirement. The biggest advantage of 401k plans is that often employers will match contributions to a certain extent, which is basically free money for you. In the end, these are just some suggestions. Probably best to consult with a financial planner to hammer out all the details."

You can deposit US dollars into the NRE account, but the money is converted to Indian Rupees INR and held as INR. You can withdraw the money and bring it back to the US as US dollars, but the INR will be converted to US at the exchange rate applicable on the date of the transaction. With the recent decline of the Indian Rupee against the US dollar, many NRE accounts lost a lot of their value. You can deposit any amount of money in your NRE account. Some banks may limit the amount you can send in one business day, but if 250 times that amount seriously limits the amount of money you want to send each year, you should not be asking here there are enough expensive lawyers, bankers and tax advisors who will gladly guide you to a satisfactory solution. There is no limitation on the total amount that you can have in your NRE account. The earnings interest paid on the sum in your NRE account is not taxable income to you in India but you may still need to file an income tax return in India to get a refund of the tax withheld by the bank TDS and sent to the tax authorities. The bank should not withhold tax on the earnings in an NRE account but it did happen to me in the past. While the interest paid on your NRE account is not taxable in India, it is taxable income to you on your US tax returns both Federal and State and you must declare it on your tax returns even though the bank will not issue a 1099INT form to you. Be aware also about the reporting requirements for foreign accounts FBAR, TD F9022.1 etc. Lots of people ignored this requirement in the past, but are more diligent these days after the IRS got a truckload of information about accounts in foreign banks and went after people charging them big penalties for not filing these forms for ever so many years. There was a huge ruckus in the Indian communities in the US about how the IRS was unfairly targeting simple folks instead of auditing the rich! But, if the total value of the accounts did not exceed 10K at any time of the year, these forms do not need to be filed. It seems, though, that you will not fall under this exemption since you are planning on having considerably larger sums in your NRE account. So be sure and follow the rules."

Same answer.  clarification, since the point apparently wasnt clear Using a spreadsheet means youre writing and organizing and maintaining the formats and formulas yourself. Essentially, you are writing your own accounting program, using the spreadsheet program as your programming language. Nothing wrong with that, it just means youre doing work to produce something that you could have purchased instead. Its up to you to decide how the value of your time doing that work trades off against the cost of the commercial product. For many people, especially as the bookkeeping becomes more complex, that isnt a good investment of their time. The otherwise billable time it would take them to maintain the spreadsheet is worth more than the cost of buying an offtheshelf product, and the product offers features that they wouldnt get around to adding to their own solution. Add to that the question of whether people find creating and tweaking spreadsheets rewarding or annoying. The right tool is always the one that lets you focus on what you actually care about, unless the cost is too high to justify it.Most folks care about getting the accounting task done a least costleast efprt. Buying a solution is least effort if the real cost including timeeffort is also lower, thats the direction theyre going to go. I maintained my own accounts, and did my taxes, in spreadsheets for quite some time. These days the time to do so, multiplied by what my time is worth, would exceed the cost of buying tools, and the commercial tools are more pleasant to use, less prone to accidents, and offer featured that I dont need but appreciate. I still use a stylesheet for one small calculation rebalancing my invedtments but thsts because I havean odd corner case the builtin tool doesnt handle well...not that it makes any practival difference, but being slightly off annoyed me.

Your question is then a question about the correlation between equity markets and currency markets. Heres a guess If equity markets crashed, you would see a lot of panic selling of stocks denominated in many currencies, but probably the most in USD, due to the large number of the worlds largest businesses trading on US stock exchanges. Therefore, when the rest of the world sells US equities they receive cash USD, which they might sell for their local currency. That selling pressure would cause USD to fall. But, when equity markets crash theres a move to safety of the bond markets. The worlds largest bond markets are denominated in which currency? Probably USD. So those who receive USD for their equities are going to spend that USD on bonds. In which case there is probably no correlation between equity markets and currency markets at all.

Its very very very plausible to do poorly over 10 years, such as the last 10 in fact. Can you really say you know your financial situation in 2030 years, and for sure wont need that money? Because predictability is important, I like buying a balanced fund and not \"pure stocks\" httpblog.ometer.com20101110takerisksinlifeforsavingschooseabalancedfund feel a little bad linking to my blog, but retyping all that into this answer seems dumb! Heres another tip. You can go one step past dollar cost averaging and try value averaging httpwww.amazon.comValueAveragingStrategyInvestmentClassicsdp0470049774 However, chances are you arent even going to be good about rebalancing if its done \"by hand,\" so personally I would not do value averaging unless you can find either a fund or a financial advisor to do it for you automatically. Finance Buff blog makes a case for a financial advisor, in case you like that more than my balanced fund suggestion httpthefinancebuff.comtheaverageinvestorshoulduseaninvestmentadvisorhowtofindone.html Like rebalancing, value averaging makes you buy more when youre depressed about the market and less when its exciting. Its hard. Dollar cost averaging is easily done by setting up automatic investment, of course, so you dont have to do it manually in the way you would with value averaging. If you read the usual canonical books on index funds and efficient markets its easy to remember the takeaway that nobody knows whether the market will go up or down, and yes you wont successfully time the market. But what you can do successfully is use an investment discipline with risk control assume that the market will fluctuate, that both up and down are likely and possible, and optimize for predictability in light of that. Most importantly, optimize to take your emotions and behavior out of the picture. Some disciplines for example are there are dozens out there, many of them snake oil, I think these I mentioned are valid. Anyway, you need some form of risk control, and putting all your money in stocks at once doesnt give you a lot of risk control. Theres no real need to get creative. A balanced fund that uses index funds for equity and bond portions is a great choice."

    "header": "Why dont market indexes use aggregate market capitalization?",
    "body": "They do but youre missing some calculations needed to gain an understanding. Intro To Stock Index Weighting Methods notes in part Market cap is the most common weighting method used by an index. Market cap or market capitalization is the standard way to measure the size of the company. You might have heard of large, mid, or small cap stocks? Large cap stocks carry a higher weighting in this index. And most of the major indices, like the SP 500, use the market cap weighting method. Stocks are weighted by the proportion of their market cap to the total market cap of all the stocks in the index. As a stocks price and market cap rises, it gains a bigger weighting in the index. In turn the opposite, lower stock price and market cap, pushes its weighting down in the index. Pros Proponents argue that large companies have a bigger effect on the economy and are more widely owned. So they should have a bigger representation when measuring the performance of the market. Which is true. Cons It doesnt make sense as an investment strategy. According to a market cap weighted index, investors would buy more of a stock as its price rises and sell the stock as the price falls. This is the exact opposite of the buy low, sell high mentality investors should use. Eventually, you would have more money in overpriced stocks and less in underpriced stocks. Yet most index funds follow this weighting method. Thus, there was likely a point in time where the S  P 500s initial sum was equated to a specific value though this is the part you may be missing here. Also, how do you handle when constituents change over time? For example, suppose in the S  P 500 that a 100,000,000 company is taken out and replaced with a 10,000,000,000 company that shouldnt suddenly make the index jump by a bunch of points because the underlying security was swapped or would you be cool with there being jumps when companies change or shares outstanding are rebalanced? Consider carefully how you answer that question. In terms of histories, Dow Jones Industrial Average and S  P 500 Index would be covered on Wikipedia where from the latter link The \"Composite Index\",[13] as the SP 500 was first called when it introduced its first stock index in 1923, began tracking a small number of stocks. Three years later in 1926, the Composite Index expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current 500.[13] Standard  Poors, a company that doles out financial information and analysis, was founded in 1860 by Henry Varnum Poor. In 1941 Poors Publishing Henry Varnum Poors original company merged with Standard Statistics founded in 1906 as the Standard Statistics Bureau and therein assumed the name Standard and Poors Corporation. The SP 500 index in its present form began on March 4, 1957. Technology has allowed the index to be calculated and disseminated in real time. The SP 500 is widely used as a measure of the general level of stock prices, as it includes both growth stocks and value stocks. In September 1962, Ultronic Systems Corp. entered into an agreement with Standard and Poors. Under the terms of this agreement, Ultronics computed the SP 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index. Throughout the market day these statistics were furnished to Standard  Poors. In addition, Ultronics also computed and reported the 94 SP subindexes.[14] There are also articles like Business Insider that have this graphic that may be interesting S  P changes over the years The makeup of the SP 500 is constantly changing notes in part \"In most years 25 to 30 stocks in the SP 500 are replaced,\" said David Blitzer, SPs Chairman of the Index Committee. And while there are strict guidelines for what companies are added, the final decision and timing of that decision depends on whats going through the heads of a handful of people employed by Dow Jones."

    "header": "Prepaying a loan Shouldnt the interest be recalculated like a shorter loan?",
    "body": "For the mortgage, youre confusing cause and effect. Loans like mortgages generally have a very simple principle behind them at any given time, the interest charged at that time is the product of the amount still owing and the interest rate. So for example on a mortgage of 100,000, at an interest rate of 5, the interest charged for the first year would be 5,000. If you pay the interest plus another 20,000 after the first year, then in the second year the interest charge would be 4,000. This view is a bit of an oversimplification, but it gets the basic point across. [In practice you would actually make payments through the year so the actual balance that interest is charged on would vary. Different mortgages would also treat compounding slightly differently, e.g. the interest might be added to the mortgage balance daily or monthly.] So, its natural that the interest charged on a mortgage reduces yearbyyear as you pay off some of the mortgage. Mortgages are typically setup to have constant payments over the life of the mortgage an \"amortisation schedule\", calculated so that by the end of the planned mortgage term, youll have paid off all of the principal. Its a straightforward effect of the way that interest works in general that these schedules incorporate higher interest payments early on in the mortgage, because thats the time when you owe more money. If you go for a 15year mortgage, each payment will involve you paying off significantly more principal each time than with a 30year mortgage for the same balance  because with a 15year mortgage, you need to hit 0 after 15 years, not 30. So since you pay off the principal faster, you naturally pay less interest even when you just compare the first 15 years. In your case what youre talking about is paying off the mortgage using the 30year payments for the first 15 years, and then suddenly paying off the remaining principal with a lump sum. But when you do that, overall youre still paying off principal later than if it had been a 15year mortgage to begin with, so you should be charged more interest, because what youve done is not the same as having a 15year mortgage. You still will save the rest of the interest on the remaining 15 years of the term, unless there are prepayment penalties. For the car loan Im not sure what is happening. Perhaps its the same situation and you just misunderstood how it was explained. Or maybe its setup with significant prepayment penalties so you genuinely dont save anything by paying early."

It would be remiss of me to not clearly state that anyone who needs to take advantage of this \"trick\" is the same person who probably shouldnt use credit cards at all.

    "body": "Why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable? The yield will rise when instability increases because the risk of default increases. If the case of Greece, the instability of government finances resulted in a 50 \"haircut\" for bond holders in 2011. In other words, bond holders suffered a 50 write down in the nominal value of their bonds. This means that holding these bonds until maturity will mean they will only receive half of the original nominal value of the bond, and that is assuming no further write downs occur. Why does selling a bond drive up the yield? Significant selling of bonds means that sellers are worried about future prospects. Sellers will outnumber buyers, so sellers will have to reduce their offer price in order to attract new buyers. So if you think Greece is not going to default as its highly likely a country would completely default, wouldnt it make sense to hold onto the bonds? If you think that it is highly unlikely that Greece will default and the prices and yields are attractive, then Greek bonds may look like an attractive investment. However, keep in mind the fate of bond holders in 2011. They were attracted to Greek bonds by the price and yield, but they suffered a 50 haircut."

    "body": "In principle, the stock price should see no change in the days leading up to an earnings announcement, and then at the moment of the announcement, the stock price should move in the direction of the earnings surprise relative to the markets belief of what earnings were going to be. In practice, stock prices tend to drift a little in the direction of the surprise shortly before the announcement and the associated price jump. This could be because smart investors were able to replicate the computations to predict the announcement or because information gets illegally leaked ahead of the announcement. So I guess your bullet point B is a likely scenario. Note that hedging activity in the options market will not affect stock price one way or another. Options transfer risk from one party to another but net to zero. Intense hedging activity may be able to push up the price of options increasing the implied volatility, but it shouldnt affect the price of a stock one way or the other. For this reason, bullet point A is not the case. Note that price behavior after the announcement is also interesting it seems to take some time to reach the correct price instead of jumping directly to it as economists would predict.

    "body": "You will make a profit in nominal dollars or nominal units of whatever currency you used to buy the token. Whether youll make a profit in real dollars depends on inflation, and in practice whether it would be possible to sell your existing tokens to someone else for the new price. Suppose when the price was 50 U 50 \"units\", since you didnt specify a currency, you bought one token. Today you can either spend 52 U for a token, and get a liter of milk, or you can spend your existing token for which you paid 50 U and get a liter of milk. It looks like you are making a profit of 2 U by spending your token. However, whether that profit is real or illusory depends on what else you could do with the token. For instance, suppose that, since the price of a token is now 52 U, you will have no trouble finding someone who wants to buy your token from you for 52 U. If you sell your token for 52 U, youll still only be able to buy 1 L of milk. So if you measure your wealth in milk, you have made no profit in the past you had a token representing 1 L of milk, and today you still have a token representing 1 L of milk. Suppose now that in the past, when a token cost 50 U, a hamburger also cost 50 U. Suppose further that a hamburger now costs 52 U. So you can sell your token for 52 U, but that 52 U will still only buy you one hamburger. So, again, if you measure your wealth in hamburgers, your have made no profit. In the past, you could have sold your token and bought a hamburger today, you can still sell your token and buy a hamburger, and youll have nothing left over, so you have gained nothing. If, on the other hand, the price of a hamburger today is still 50 U, then you call sell your token for 52 U, buy a hamburger for 50 U, and still have 2 U left over. You have made a profit. What this all goes to show is that, in practice, the idea of \"profit\" depends on the overall economy, and whether you could exchange the currency units you have in your possession for a greater quantity of goods than you could in the past. Whether this is possible depends on the relative changes in price of various goods. In other words, if you get your money by selling Product A, and later you buy Product B, you may or may not make a profit depending on how the prices of the two products moved relative to one another. Also, in your hypothetical setup, the \"currency\" the token is directly linked to the value of a single good, so you can always at least get 1 L of milk for your token. Most real currency is not bound to specific goods like your milk token, so it is possible for your currency to lose value in an absolute sense. For instance, suppose you sell a book for 5. The 5 is not a \"book token\" and you cannot rely on being able to exchange it for a book in the future in the future, all books may cost 10, and the prices of all goods may rise similarly, so your currency will actually be worth less no matter how you try to use it. This could happen with the milk token if the milkman announces that henceforth 1 L of milk will cost 2 tokens your existing token suddenly loses half its value. In sum, it is easy to calculate whether you made a profit in currency units. What is harder is to calculate whether you made a profit in \"real terms\" often referred to as \"real dollars\" or \"inflationadjusted dollars\", or the equivalent in your favorite currency. The reason this is hard is because the idea of \"real dollars\" is fundamentally linked to the possibility of exchanging currency for goods and services, and so it depends what goods youre buying. Inflation statistics published by governments and the like use a \"basket\" of goods to approximate the overall price movements in the economy as a whole."

    "body": "Square does not care if you run a 10 transaction to test the system. They are concerned with its use to move meaningful amounts of money. The only people who do this will be the DunningKruger gang, who only think they are clever. Because of course Square will hunt them down, sue, garnish andor prosecute them! But the expense of doing so is all on Square, making it a total lose. The cheapest resolution is to not let it happen in the first place. The 3 cash advance fees, lack of rewards points, and the higher interest rate are not just for profiteering. They reflect, and pay for, the higher risk of loaning money via cash advance to put it indelicately, the risk of default. Cash advance credit limits are often much lower than purchase limits. If a merchant is selling himself phantom merchandise to get easy cash advances, it means he is not using regular ways of borrowing money. Perhaps because he cant, because he has exhausted his other opportunities to borrow, risk managers have cut him off. Square has no reason to care either way but the issuing bank does, and through Visa etc., they will disallow this behavior.  PayPal Heres rate used here instead of Squares, to simplify math."

    "body": "This is an excellent question kudos for asking it. How much a person pays over spot with gold can be negotiated in person at a coin shop or in an individual transaction, though many shops will refuse to negotiate. You have to be a clever and tough negotiator to make this work and you wont have any success online. However, in researching your question, I dug for some information on one gold ETF OUNZ  which is physically backed by gold that you can redeem. It appears that you only pay the spot price if you redeem your shares for physical gold But arent those fees exorbitant? After all, redeeming for 50 ounces of Gold Eagles would result in a 3,000 fee on a 65,000 transaction. Thats 4.6 percent! Actually, the fee simply reflects the convenience premium that gold coins command in the market. Here are the exchange fees compared with the premiums over spot charged by two major online gold retailers Investors do pay an annual expense ratio, but the tradeoff is that as an investor, you dont have to worry about a thief breaking in and stealing your gold."

    "header": "If one owns 75 of company shares, does that mean that he would have to take upon himself 75 of the companys expenses?",
    "body": "I think your question might be coming from a misunderstanding of how corporate structures work  specifically, that a corporation is a legal entity sort of like a person that can have its own assets and debts. To make it clear, lets look at your example. We have two founders, Albert and Brian, and they start a corporation called CorpTech. When they start the company, it has no assets  just like you would if you owned nothing and had no bank account. In order to do anything, CorpTech is going to need some money. So Albert and Brian give it some. They can give it as much as they want  they can give it property if they want, too. Usually, people dont just put money into a corporation without some sort of agreement in place, though. In most cases, the agreement says something like \"Each member will own a fraction of the company that is in proportion to this initial investment.\" The way that is done varies depending on the type of corporation, but in general, if Albert ends up owning 75 and Brian ends up owning 25, then they probably valued their contributions at 75 and 25 of the total value. These contributions dont have to be money or property, though. They could just be general \"knowhow,\" or \"connections,\" or \"an expectation that they will do some work.\" The important thing is that they agree on the value of these contributions and assign ownership of the company according to that agreement. If they dont have an agreement, then the laws of the state that the company is registered in will say how the ownership is assigned. Now, what \"ownership\" means can be different depending on the context. When it comes to decisionmaking, you could \"own\" one percentage of the company in terms of votes, but when it comes to shares of future profits, you could own a different amount. This is why you can have voting and nonvoting versions of a companys stock, for example. So this is a critical point  the ownership of a company is independent of the individual contributions to the company. The next part of your question is related to this what happens when CorpTech sees an opportunity to make an investment? If it has enough cash on hand because of the initial investment, or through financing, or reinvested profits, then the decision to make the investment is made according to Albert and Brians ownership agreement, and they spend it. The money doesnt belong to them individually anymore, it belongs to CorpTech, and so CorpTech is spending it. They are just making the decision for CorpTech to spend it. This is why people say the owners are not financially liable beyond their initial investment. If the deal is bad, and they lose the money, the most they can lose is what they initially put in. On the other hand, if CorpTech doesnt have the money, then they have to figure out a way to get it. They might decide to each put in an amount in proportion to their ownership, so that their stake doesnt change. Or, Albert might agree to finance the deal 100 in exchange for a larger share of ownership. Or, he could agree to fund all of it without a larger stake, because Brian is the one who set the deal up. Or, they might take out a loan, and not need to invest any new money. Or, they might find an investor who agrees to put in the needed money in exchange for a a 51 share, in which case Albert and Brian will have to figure out how to split the remaining 49 if they agree to the deal. The details of how all of this would work depend on the structure LLC, LLP, Ccorp, Scorp, etc, but in general, the idea is that the company has assets and debts, and the owners can have voting rights, equity rights, and rights to future profits in any type of split that they want, regardless of what the companies assets and debts are, or what their initial investment was."

    "header": "Why does selling and then rebuying stock not lead to free money?",
    "body": "There are several reasons. First, if you sell your stock \"at any price\", you may be selling it for less than you originally bought it for. Thus you will take a loss right at the beginning of your scheme. If you \"rinse and repeat\", the problem only gets worse. Every time you sell your stock, you will have to sell it at an even lower price in order to lower the price even more. Then you buy it back and. . . just resell it an even lower price? It should be clear that you are not making any money this way. Second, even if you dont sell it at an absolute loss, you must sell it at a relative loss in order to lower the price. In other words, if someone will currently buy your shares for X, and you want to lower the price, you must sell them for less than X. But you could have made more money by selling them for X, since someone was already willing to buy them at that price. In order to bring the price down significantly, you have to sell the stock for less than people currently believe it is worth, which means youre incurring a loss relative to just selling it at the market rate. Of course, you can still make money if it goes back up again, but selling it at an extra loss this way just makes it harder to break even. Third, if you sell the stock at X, whoever you sold it to is not going to sell it right back to you at X, because then they would not make any money. You could in theory buy it from someone else, but the same principle holds if the stock price has just gone down, people who have it may be waiting for it to go back up. This is doubly true if anyone suspects you have been trying to manipulate the stock price, because they will then suspect that the price drop is artificial and it will soon go back up. Fourth, even if someone did sell it right back to you at the price you sold it for, then what? You now hold the stock at a lower price, but you dont gain unless it goes back up. If it wasnt going up before until you took action, there is no reason to suppose it will go back up now. In fact, if you had enough shares to significantly influence the price, other people may have been fooled into thinking the value is actually lower now. The basic problem is that, in order for you to buy it at a low price, someone else has to sell it at that low price. It is easy to sell someone a stock for less than its worth, but it will be hard to get people to sell it back to you for less than its worth. If you engage in deceptive practices to get people to do this, you may be guilty of securities fraud."

No, you can do it yourself. The 49 is for your convenience, but theres nothing they can do that you wouldnt be able to do on your own. What I need to know and what I need to do before forming an LLC? You need to know that LLC is a legal structure that is designed to provide legal protections. As such, it is prudent to talk to a legal adviser, i.e. a Virginialicensed attorney. Is it possible if I hire some employees who living in India? Is the salary for my employees a expense? Do I need to claim this expense? This, I guess, is entirely unrelated to your questions about LLC. Yes, it is possible. The salary you pay your employees is your expense. You need to claim it, otherwise youd be inflating your earnings which in certain circumstances may constitute fraud. What I need to do to protect my company? For physical protection, youd probably hire a security guard. If youre talking about legal protections, then again  talk to a lawyer. What can I do to reduce taxes? Vote for a politician that promises to reduce taxes. Most of them never deliver though. Otherwise you can do what everyone else is doing  tax planning. That is  plan ahead your expenses, time your invoices and utilize tax deferral programs etc. Talk to your tax adviser, who should be a EA or a CPA licensed in Virginia. What I need to know after forming an LLC? Youll need to learn what are the filing requirements in your State annual reports, tax reports, business taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes, etc. Most are the same for same proprietors and LLCs, so you probably will not be adding to much extra redtape. Your attorney and tax adviser will help you with this, but you can also research yourself on the Virginia department of corporationsState department whichever deals with LLCs."

    "body": "To avoid nitpicks, i state up front that this answer is applicable to the US Europeans, Asians, Canadians, etc may well have quite different systems and rules. You have nothing to worry about if you pay off your creditcard statement in full on the day it is due in timely fashion. On the other hand, if you routinely carry a balance from month to month or have taken out cash advances, then making whatever payment you want to make that month ASAP will save you more in finance charges than you could ever earn on the money in your savings account. But, if you pay off each months balance in full, then read the fine print about when the payment is due very carefully it might say that payments received before 5 pm will be posted the same day, or it might say before 3 pm, or before 7 pm EST, or noon PST, etc etc etc. As JoeTaxpayer says, if you can pay online with a guaranteed day for the transaction and you do it before any deadline imposed by the creditcard company, you are fine. My bank allows me to write \"electronic\" checks on its website, but a paper check is mailed to the creditcard company. The bank claims that if I specify the due date, they will mail the check enough in advance that the creditcard company will get it by the due date, but do you really trust the USPS to deliver your check by noon, or whatever? Besides the bank will put a hold on that money the day that check is cut. I havent bothered to check if the money being held still earns interest or not. In any case, the bank disclaims all responsibility for the aftereffects late payment fees, finance charges on all purchases, etc if that paper check is not received on time and so your creditcard account goes to \"late payment\" status. Oh, and my bank also wants a monthly fee for its BillPay service any number of such \"electronic\" checks allowed each month. The BillPay service does include payment electronically to local merchants and utilities that have accounts at the bank and have signed up to receive payments electronically. All my creditcard companies allow me to use their website to authorize them to collect the payment that I specify from my bank accounts. I can choose the day, the amount, and which of my bank accounts they will collect the money from, but I must do this every month. Very conveniently, they show a calendar for choosing the date with the due date marked prominently, and as mhoranpspreps comment points out, the payment can be scheduled well in advance of the date that the payment will actually be made, that is, I dont need to worry about being without Internet access because of travel and thus being unable to login to the creditcard website to make the payment on the date it is due. I can also sign up for AutoPay which takes afixed amountminimum payment duepayment in full whatever I choose on the date due, and this will happen month after month after month with no further action necessary on my part. With either choice, it is up to the card company to collect money from my account on the day specified, and if they mess up, they cannot charge late payment fees or finance charge on new purchases etc. Also, unlike my bank, there are no fees for this service. It is also worth noting that many people do not like the idea of the creditcard company withdrawing money from their bank account, and so this option is not to everyones taste."

For trading stock, the value can be known immediately by checking any valid data providers price and marking to market. For nontrading stock, the value has to be \"marked to model\". This can get one into Enron sized trouble. In this case, its best to either leave the value of the stock at the purchase price and recognize gains upon sale, use a price from another honest transaction by third parties which are most likely difficult to attain, or to use some shorthand measure like applying the market PE. Be wary of strangely high figures for value from the purchase price by using a market average, and dont throw away the shares just yet if a strangely low one arises.

    "header": "Why have U.S. bank interest rates been so low for the past few years?",
    "body": "These rates are so low because the cost of money is so low. Specifically, two rates are near zero. The Federal Reserve discount rate, which is \"the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Banks lending facilitythe discount window.\" The effective federal funds rate, which is the rate banks pay when they trade balances with each other through the Federal Reserve. Banks want to profit on the loans they make, like mortgage loans. To do so, they try to maximize the difference between the rates they charge on mortgages and other loans revenue, and the rates they pay savings account holders, the Federal Reserve or other banks to obtain funds expenses. This means that the rates they offer to pay are as close to these rates as possible. As the charts shows, both rates have been cut significantly since the start of the recession, either through open market operations the federal funds rate or directly the discount rate. The discount rate is set directly by the regional Federal Reserve banks every 14 days. In most cases, the federal funds rate is lower than the discount rate, in order to encourage banks to lend money to each other instead of borrowing it from the Fed. In the past, however, there have been rare instances where the federal funds rate has exceeded the discount rate, and its been cheaper for banks to borrow money directly from the Fed than from each other."

It gives you a shortterm emergency fund you can tap and then immediately pay back, or as close to immediately as possible. Credit cards are one of the safer ways to pay via internet, since they have guarantees that limit your liability if they are misused, and the bank can help you \"charge back\" to a vendor who doesnt deliver as promised.

Over the long term, housing matches inflation. Sounds crazy, but. Even into the bubble, if you looked at housing in terms of mortgage payment at the prevailing 30yr fixed rate and converted the payment to hours needed to work to make the payment, the 2005 bubble never was. Not at the median, anyway. At todays 5 rate, the mortgage will cost you 3.75 after taxes. And assuming a 3 long term inflation rate, less than 1.

In general, your idea is correct, the higher the price the less you should want the stock. But in some sense, the past price is irrelevant, you cant buy it at the past price. You should buy it now if its the best option now. And that is based on your assessment of whether its future prospects are worth the current price and in fact enough worth enough to make buying the stock the best economic decision you can currently make. Finally, the price may have gone up for a reason. The company may have done something, or some information about the company may have become known, that affects its future prospects.

    "body": "The best strategy for RSUs, specifically, is to sell them as they vest. Usually, vesting is not all in one day, but rather spread over a period of time, which assures that you wont sell in one extremely unfortunate day when the stock dipped. For regular investments, there are two strategies I personally would follow Sell when you need. If you need to cash out  cash out. Rebalance  if you need to rebalance your portfolio i.e. not cash out, but reallocate investments or move investment from one company to another  do it periodically on schedule. For example, every 13 months in the US, where the long term cap. gains tax rates kick in after 1 year of holding  rebalance. You wouldnt care about specific price drops on that day, because they also affect the new investments. Speculative strategies trying to \"sell high buy low\" usually bring to the opposite results you end up selling low and buying high. But if you want to try and do that  youll have to get way more technical than just \"dollar cost averaging\" or similar strategies. Most people dont have neither time nor the knowledge for that, and even those who do rarely can beat the market and never can, in the long run."

Lease a new car for three years. Assume no need for repairs during those three years. At the end of the three years return the car in return for 0. Cost of option 1 is 3000 plus repairs. Cost of Option 2 is 36 months x monthly lease cost. The first 83 of the monthly lease cost is to cover the 3000 fixed cost of option 1. The rest of the monthly lease cost is to cover the cost of repairs. Also remember that some leases have a initial down payment due at signing, and penalties for condition, and excess mileage. The lease company may also require a higher level of insurance for the lease to cover their investment if you have an accident. Plus If you fall in love with a different car two year from now, or your needs change you are locked in until the end of the lease period."

    "header": "What is the difference between a stock and a bond?",
    "body": "A stock is an ownership interest in a company. There can be multiple classes of shares, but to simplify, assuming only one class of shares, a company issues some number of shares, lets say 1,000,000 shares and you can buy shares of the company. If you own 1,000 shares in this example, you would own one onethousandth of the company. Public companies have their shares traded on the open market and the price varies as demand for the stock comes and goes relative to people willing to sell their shares. You typically buy stock in a company because you believe the company is going to prosper into the future and thus the value of its stock should rise in the open market. A bond is an indebted interest in a company. A company issues bonds to borrow money at an interest rate specified in the bond issuance and makes periodic payments of principal and interest. You buy bonds in a company to lend the company money at an interest rate specified in the bond because you believe the company will be able to repay the debt per the terms of the bond. The value of a bond as traded on the open exchange varies as the prevailing interest rates vary. If you buy a bond for 1,000 yielding 5 interest and interest rates go up to 10, the value of your bond in the open market goes down so that the payment terms of 5 on 1,000 matches hypothetical terms of 10 on a lesser principal amount. Whatever lesser principal amount at the new rate would lead to the same payment terms determines the new market value. Alternatively, if interest rates go down, the current value of your bond increases on the open market to make it appear as if it is yielding a lower rate. Regardless of the market value, the company continues to pay interest on the original debt per its terms, so you can always hold onto a bond and get the original promised interest as long as the company does not go bankrupt. So in summary, bonds tend to be a safer investment that offers less potential return. However, this is not always the case, since if interest rates skyrocket, your bonds value will plummet, although you could just hold onto them and get the low rate originally promised."

This is a common misconception, commonly seen when people think that income or gambling winnings are not taxable below 600, when in reality 600 is the threshold for issuing a Form 1099. Given that, it would be foolish to close a wildly successful  GoFundMe campaign, because closing the campaign wont change the taxability of the income. But it will probably cut off the continued donations you may have received. With the amount of money at stake, you should spend the couple hundred dollars to hire a CPA to look at your specific situation.

    "body": "Suppose that the ETF is currently at a price of 100. Suppose that the next day it moves up 10 to a price of 110 and the following day it moves down 5 to a price of 104.5. Over these two days the ETF has had a net gain of 4.5 from its original price. The inverse ETF reverses the daily gainslosses of the base ETF. Suppose for simplicity that the inverse ETF also starts out at a price of 100. So on the first day it goes down 10 to 90 and on the second day it goes up 5 to 94.5. Thus over the two days the inverse ETF has had a net loss of 5.5. The specific dollar amounts do not matter here. The result is that the ETF winds up at 11095  104.5 of its original price and the inverse ETF is at 90105  94.5 of its original price. A similar example is given here. As suggested by your quote, this is due to compounding. A gain of X followed by a loss of Y compounded on the gain is not in general the same as a loss of X followed by a gain of Y compounded on the loss. Or, more simply put, if something loses 10 of its value and then gains 10 of its new value, it will not return to its original value, because the 10 it gained was 10 of its decreased value, so its not enough to bring it all the way back up. Likewise if it gains 10 and then loses 10, it will go slightly below its original value since it lost 10 of its newly increased value."

    "body": "I think Georges answer explains fairly well why the brokerages dont allow this  its not an exchange rule, its just that the brokerage has to have the shares to lend, and normally those shares come from peoples margin, which is impossible on a nonmarginable stock. To address the question of what the alternatives are, on popular stocks like SIRI, a deep InTheMoney put is a fairly accurate emulation of an actual short interest. If you look at the options on SIRI you will see that a 3 or higher put has a delta of 1, which is the same delta as an actual short share. You also dont have to worry about problems like margin calls when buying options. The only thing you have to worry about is the expiration date, which isnt generally a major issue if youre buying inthemoney options... unless youre very wrong about the direction of the stock, in which case you could lose everything, but thats always a risk with penny stocks no matter how you trade them. At least with a put option, the maximum amount you can lose is whatever you spent on the contract. With a short sale, a bull rush on the stock could potentially wipe out your entire margin. Thats why, when betting on downward motion in a microcap or penny stock, I actually prefer to use options. Just be aware that option contracts can generally only move in increments of 0.05, and that your brokerage will probably impose a bidask spread of up to 0.10, so the share price has to move down at least 10 cents or 10 on a roughly 1 stock like SIRI for you to just break even definitely dont attempt to use this as a daytrading tool and go for longer expirations if you can."

    "header": "Why are U.S. Treasury interest rates are so low vs. other nearly riskfree rates?",
    "body": "As Im sure you are reading in Hulls classic, the basic valuation of bonds depends on the chance of entity defaulting on those bonds. Lets start with just looking at the US. The United States has a big advantage over corporations in issuing debt as it also prints the same currency that the debt is denominated in. This makes it much easier not to default on your debt as you can always print more money to pay it. Printing too much currency would cause inflation lowering the value of debt, but this would also lower the value of US corporate debt as well. So you can think of even the highest rated corporate bonds as having the same rate as government debt plus a little extra due to the additional default risk of the corporation. The situation with other AA rated governments is more complicated. Most of those governments have debt denominated in their local currency as well so it may seem like they should all have similar rates. However, some governments have higher and some actually have lower rates than the United States. Now, as above, some of the difference is due to the possible need of printing too much currency to cover the debt in crisis and now that we have more than one country to invest in the extra risk of international money flowing out of the countrys bonds. However, the bigger difference between AA governments rates depends more on money flow, central banks and regulation. Bonds are still mostly freely traded instruments that respond to supply and demand, but this supply and demand is heavily influenced by governments. Central banks buy up large portions of the debt raising demand and lowering rates. Regulators force banks to hold a certain amount of treasuries perhaps inflating demand. Finally, to answer your question the United States has some interesting advantages partially just due to its long history of stability, controlled inflation and large economy making treasuries valuable as one of the lowest risk investments. So its rates are generally on the low end, but government manipulation can still mean that it is not necessarily the lowest."

    "body": "You have multiple issues buried within this question. First, we dont know your tax bracket. For my answer, Ill assume 25. This simply means that in 2016, youll have a taxable 37,650 or higher. The interesting thing is that losses and gains are treated differently. A 25ers long term gain is taxed at 15, yet losses, up to 3000, can offset ordinary income. This sets the stage for strategic tax loss harvesting. In the linked article, I offered a look at how the strategy would have resulted in the awful 20002009 decade producing a slight gain 1, not great, of course vs the near 10 loss the SP suffered over that time. This was by taking losses in down years, and capturing long term gains when positive and not using a carried loss. Back to you  a 15ers long term gain tax is zero. So using a gain to offset a loss makes little sense. Just as creating a loss to offset the gain. The bottom line? Enjoy the loss, up to 3000 against your income, and only take gains when theres no loss. This advice is all superseded by my rule \"Dont let the tax tail wag the investing dog.\" For individual stocks, I would never suggest a transaction for tax purposes. You keep good stocks, you sell bad ones. Sell a stock to take a short term loss only to have it recover in the 30 day waiting period just once, and youll learn that lesson. Learn it here for free, dont make that mistake at your own expense."

That would also require you to be a licensed financial adviser, at least to the best of my understanding.

You should do this only with a proper legal and tax advice  from an attorney andor CPAEA licensed in your state.

Tax loss harvesting has nothing to do with your horizon nor the activepassive difference, really. As a practical matter, a good tax loss harvesting plan involves mechanically selling losers and immediately putting the money in another stock with moreorless similar risk so your portfolio doesnt change much. In this way you get a stable portfolio that performs just like a static portfolio but gives you a tax benefit each year. The IRS officially prohibits this practice via the \"wash sale rule\" that says you cant buy a substantially identical asset within a short period of time. However, though two stocks have similar risk, they are not generally substantially similar in a legal sense, so the IRS cant really beat you in court and they dont try. Basically you cant just buy the same stock again. The roboadvisor is advertising that they will perform this service, keeping your portfolio pretty much static in terms of risk, in such a way that your tax benefit is maximized and you dont run afoul of the IRS."

The former probably has negative expected value while the latter probably has positive expected value, but that is not a distinction to include in a definition else every company that gives a bad quarterly earnings report suddenly changes categories. However, investment professionals have a vested interest in claiming there is a difference that justifies them charging fees to steer you into the right investment. Consequently, hairsplitting ideas like the motive behind a purchase are introduced. The classification of an item to be purchased should not depend on the mental state of its purchaser. Depending on the situation, it may be right to engage in negative EV behavior. For example, if you have 1000 and need 2000 by next week or else you cant have an operation and you will die and you cant find anyone to give you a loan. Your optimal strategy is to gamble your 1000, at the best odds you can get, with a possible outcome of 2000.

This means that, for various reasons, they are willing to take on more risk than you, if it pays off on average they are young [and have many years of salary earnings in front of them], or they are rich [can afford to lose money sometimes if it pays off on average].

The reason I put \"save\" in quotes, is that you dont necessarily save on taxes, but you can defer taxes. The driving factor behind this is that you specify your own fiscal calendaryear. Incorporating allows you to defer income for up to 6 months. Meaning that if you make your fiscal year starting in August or September, for example, you can claim that income on the following year August  6 months  February. It allows you to keep the current year taxes down. Also, any income left over at year end, is taxed at 15 the Corporation rate rather than the 3040 personal rate you get with a soleproprietorship.

Option 1 I could buy two studio apartments in the center of a European capital city and rent out one apartment on shortterm rental and live in the other. Occasionally I could Airbnb the apartment I live in to allow me to travel more one of my life goals. To say \"European capital city\" is such a massive generalization, I would disregard this point based on that alone. Athens is a European capital city and so is Berlin but they have very different economies at this point. Lets put that aside for now. You have to beware of the following costs when using property as an investment this list is nonexhaustive The positive you have someone paying the mortgage or allowing you to recoup what you paid for the apartment. But can you guarantee an ROI of 1015 ? Far from it. If investing in real estate yielded guaranteed results, everyone would do it. This is where we go back to my initial point about \"European capital city\" being a massive generalization. Option 2 Take a loan at very low interest rate probably 22.5 fixed for 15 years and buy something a little nicer and bigger. This would be incase I decide to have a family in say, 5 years time. I would need to service the loan at up to EUR 800  USD 1100 per month. If your life plan is taking you down the path of having a family and needed the larger space for your family, then you need the space to live in and you shouldnt be looking at it as an investment that will give you at least 10 returns. Buying property you intend to live in is as much a life choice as it is an investment. You will treat the property much different from the way something you rent out gets treated. It means youll be in a better position when you decide to sell but dont go in to this because you think a return is guaranteed. Do it if you think it is what you need to achieve your life goals. Option 3 Buy bonds and shares. But I havent the faintest idea about how to do that andor manage a portfolio. If I was to go down that route how do I proceed with some confidence I wont lose all the money? Lets say you are 35 years old. The general rule is that 100 minus your age is what you should put in to equities and the rest in something more conservative. Consider this This strategy is long term and the finer details are beyond the scope of an answer like this. You have quite some money to invest so you would get preferential treatment at many financial institutions. I want to address your point of having a goal of 1015 return.

Your \"business\" earns profit from chartering the boat, which if I recall correctly is taxed at a lower rate. You get to go sailing for free. Then there was the concept of subdividing the businesses. If you own a restaurant, create another business to own the property, and the equipment used in the company. Then lease the equipment and rent the land to the restaurant. Now admittedly I thought this was like the Daylight Savings plan of tax avoidance, I mean now arent you essentially having two companies paying half the taxes. I am sure there are well paid CPAs that make the math happen, perhaps using insurance plans.. Perhaps each business funds a \"whole life\" insurance account, and contributes vast amounts into that. Then you take a loan from your insurance account. Loans of course are not income, so not taxed. The third way is to create your own bank. Banks are required to have reserves of 9. Meaning if I have 100 dollars, the FDIA allows me to loan 1,111. I then charge you 20 interest, or 222yr. Now how much can I loan? ...well you can see how profitable that is. Sure you pay taxes, but when you print your own money who cares? Most of this is just gleamed from books, and government publications, but that was my general understanding of it. Feel free to correct the finer points."

    "body": "The end result is basically the same, its just a choice of whether you want to base the final amount you receive on your salary, or on the stock market. You pay in a set proportion of your salary, and receive a set proportion of your salary in return. The pension both contributions and benefit are based on your career earnings. You get x of your salary every year from retirement until death. These are just a private investment, basically you pay a set amount in, and whatever is there is what you get at the end. Normally you would buy an annuity with the final sum, which pays you a set amount per year from retirement until death, as with the above. The amount you receive depends on how much you pay in, and the performance of the investment. If the stock market does well, youll get more. If it does badly, you could actually end up with less. In general in as much as anything relating to the stock market and investment can be generalised, a Defined Benefit plan is usually considered better for \"security\"  or at least, public sector ones, and a majority of people in my experience would prefer one, but it entirely depends on your personal attitude to risk. Im on a defined benefit plan and like the fact that I basically get a benefit based on a proportion of my salary and that the amount is guaranteed, no matter what happens to the stock market in the meantime. I pay in 9 of my salary get 2 of my salary as pension, for each year I pay into the pension no questions, no ifs or buts, no performance indicators. Others prefer a defined contribution scheme because they know that it is based on the amount they pay in, not the amount they earn although to an extent it is still based on earnings, as thats what defines how much you pay in, and because it has the potential to grow significantly based on the stock market. Unfortunately, nobody can give you a \"which is best\" answer  if I knew how pension funds were going to perform over the next 1050 years, I wouldnt be on StackExchange, Id be out there making a rather large fortune on the stock market."

A CPA may or may not specialize in tax matters, so if you have a tax related issue, especially an audit, review or appeal, you may want to query a prospective CPA as to their experience with tax matters and representing clients, appeals, etc. You would likely be better off with an EA than a CPA who eschews tax work and specializes in other things such as financial auditsOn the other hand if you have need of advice that is more generalized to accounting, audits, etc then youd want to talk with a CPA as opposed to an EA"

    "body": "Isnt it true that on the exdividend date, the price of the stock goes down roughly the amount of the dividend? That is, what you gain in dividend, you lose in price drop. Yes and No. It Depends! Generally stocks move up and down during the market, and become more volatile on some news. So One cant truly measure if the stock has gone down by the extent of dividend as one cannot isolate other factors for what is a normal share movement. There are time when the prices infact moves up. Now would it have moved more if there was no dividend is speculative. Secondly the dividends are very small percentage compared to the shares trading price. Generally even if 100 dividend are announced, they are on the share capital. On share prices dividends would be less than 1. Hence it becomes more difficult to measure the movement of stock. Note if the dividend is greater than a said percentage, there are rules that give guidelines to factor this in options and other area etc. Lets not mix these exceptions. Why is everyone making a big deal out of the amount that companies pay in dividends then? Why do some people call themselves \"dividend investors\"? It doesnt seem to make much sense. There are some set of investors who are passive. i.e. they want to invest in good stock, but dont want to sell it i.e. more like keep it for long time. At the same time they want some cash potentially to spend similar to interest received on Bank Deposits. This class of share holders, it makes sense to invest into companies that give dividends, as year on year they keep receiving some money. If they on the other hand has invested into a company that does not give dividends, they would have to sell some units to get the same money back. This is the catch. They have to sell in whole units, there is brokerage, fees, etc, there are tax events. Some countries have taxes that are more friendly to dividends than capital gains. Thus its an individual choice whether to invest into companies that give good dividends or into companies that dont give dividends. Giving or not giving dividends does not make a company good or bad."

    "body": "Theres a huge difference between \"can an anverage person make a profit on the stock market\" and \"can an average person get rich off the stock market\". It is certainly possible for an average person to profit, but of course you are unlikely to profit as much as the big Wall Street guys. An SP 500 index fund, for instance, would be a pretty good way to profit. People with highpowered tools may make a lot of money picking individual stocks, and may even make some choices that help them when the market is down, but its difficult to see how they could consistently make money over the long term without the SP 500 also going up. The same applies, to varying extents, to various other index funds, ETFs, and mutual funds. I agree with littleadv that there is no single \"right\" thing for everyone to do. My personal take is that index funds are a good bet, and Ive seen a lot of people take that view on personal finance blogs, etc. for whatever thats worth. One advantage of index funds that track major indexes like the SP 500 is that because they are and are perceived as macroindicators of the overall economic situation, at least youre in the same boat as many other people. On one level, that means that if you lose money a lot of other investors are also losing money, and when large numbers of people start losing money, that makes governments take action, etc., to turn things around. On another level, the SP 500 is a lot of big companies if it goes down, some of those big companies are losing value, and they will use their bigcompany resources to gain value, and if they succeed, the index goes up again and you benefit. In other words, index funds and large mutual funds, ETFs, etc. make investing less about what daytrading wonks focus on, which is trying to make a \"hot choice\" for a large gain. They make it more about hitching your wagon to an extremely large star that is powered by all the resources of extremely large companies, so that when those companies increase their value, you gain. The bigger the pool of people whose fortunes rise and fall with your own, the more you become part of an investment portfolio that is I cant resist saying it \"too big to fail\". That isnt to say that the SP 500 cant lose value from time to time, but rather that if it does go down big and hard and stay there, you probably have bigger problems than losing money in the stock market e.g., the US economy is collapsing and you should begin stockpiling bullets and canned food."

I know of a few options that may or may not be close to what youre looking for. The SEC provides FTP access to the EDGAR system. You could download and parse the text files they provide. Yahoo Finance provides summary files of financial statements e.g., GOOG as well as links to the full statements in the EDGAR system. Once again, parsing may be your only option for these data. Xignite, a proprietary market data provider, provides a financial statement API. If you need these data for a commercial application, you could contact them and work something out. Frankly, if you need these data for a commercial application, youre probably better off paying for the data The Center for Research into Security Prices provides data from financial statements. I believe its also exposed through several of their APIs. As with most financial data, CRSP is sort of a gold standard, although I havent personally used their API to fetch data from financial statements, so I cant speak for it specifically.

A bank will be able to tell you how much you can afford and how much theyll lend you. If you approach an agent and tell them the exact range of price, area youre interested in, and other specifics such as number of bedrooms, etc, that agent should be happy to find houses to fit your request. Obviously, an agent listing million dollar homes, busy with those all day, is not going to want to handle a buyer looking for a 200K home. But in the end, the real estate agents arent all listing high end, and someone is moving the smaller houses as well. Often, an office will have a call center where agents who are less busy will answer the phone hoping to get a client that will bring a sale. Thats one way to go. The other is word of mouth.

For spouses filing a joint return, the limits are still the same 55006000 for each spouse, and the sum total of Traditional IRA contributions for both spouses also must not exceed the sum total of earned income of both spouses.

Companies can go out of business, or take a major hit and never recover. Take Volkswagen for example, in 2015 due to a scandal they were involved in, their stocks went downhill. Now their stocks are starting to rise again. The investors goal is not to wait as long as necessary to make a profit on every stock purchase, but to make the largest profit possible in the shortest time possible. Sometimes this means selling a stock before it recovers if it ever does. I think the problem with most buyers is that they desire the most gain they can possibly have. However, that is very risky. This can be true. Every investor needs to gauge the risk theyre willing to take and highgain investments are riskier. Therefore, its better to be winning [smallmedium] amounts of money 100 of the time than [any] amount of money 25. Safer investments do tend to yield more consistent returns, but this doesnt mean that every investor should aim for lowyield investments. Again, this is driven by the investors risk tolerance.

I am well aware that there are things that I think are good ideas that others think are bad ideas and vice versa. To your specific point I suppose you could say that having a place to live is a necessity. But most people do not live in the absolute minimum necessary to give them a place to sleep and protection from the weather. You could survive with a oneroom apartment with a bed on one side and a toilet and some minimal cooking facilities on the other. Most people have considerably more than that. At some point thats luxury and not necessity. And if you want to push it, you COULD live in a cardboard box under a bridge, you dont NEED a house or apartment to survive. Personally I think its absurd that as a homeowner I get a deduction for my mortgage interest, while if someone were to rent an identical house with a monthly rental equal to exactly the same amount that I am paying on my mortgage, he would receive no deduction. The stated goal of that one was to encourage home ownership. But people who own homes are generally richer than those who rent, so the net result is that the poor are paying higher taxes to help subsidize the homes of the rich. And then the rich congratulate themselves on how they are giving these tax breaks to help make housing more affordable for poor people. To reiterate keshlam, tax laws only makes sense when understood politically. Yes, some people have fine ideas about what is fair and just. Others simply want tax breaks that benefit their business or people with tough financial situations that just happen by chance to resemble their own. Many of the people with noble ideas have little concept of what the implications of the policies they push are. Many of the ideas that some people view as worthy and noble, others view as frivolous, counterproductive, or even evil. Then you mash all these competing groups and interest together and see what comes out."

    "body": "especially considering it has a mortgage on it technically a home equity loan on my primary residence. Im not following. Does it have a mortgage on it, or your primary residence a different property was used as a security for the loan? If it is HELOC from a different property  then it is really your business what to do with it. You can spend it all on casinos in Vegas for all that the bank cares. Is this a complicated transaction? Any gotchas I should be aware of before embarking on it? Obviously you should talk to an attorney and a tax adviser. But heres my two cents Dont fall for the \"incorporate in NevadaDelawareWyomingSome other lie\" trap. You must register in the State where you live, and in the State where the property is. Incorporating in any other State will just add complexity and costs, and will not save you anything whatsoever. 2.1 State Taxes  some States tax LLCs. For example, in California youll pay at least 800 a year just for the right of doing business. If you live in California or the property is in California  you will pay this if you decide to set up an LLC. 2.2 Income taxes  make sure to not elect to tax your LLC as a corporation. The default for LLC is \"disregarded\" status and it will be taxed for income tax purposes as your person. I.e. IRS doesnt care and doesnt know about it and most States, as well. If you actively select to tax it as a corporation theres such an option  it will cost you very dearly. So dont, and if someone suggest such a thing to you  run away from that person as fast as you can. Mortgages  it is very hard to get a mortgage when the property is under the LLC. If you already have a mortgage on that property the property is the one securing the loan  it may get called once you transfer it into LLC, since from banks perspective that would be transferring ownership. Local taxes  transferring into LLC may trigger a new tax assessment. If you just bought the property  that will probably not matter much. If it appreciated  you may get hit with higher property taxes. There are also many little things  once youre a LLC and not individual youll have to open a business bank account, will probably need a new insurance policy, etc etc. These dont add much to costs and are more of an occasional nuisance."

    "body": "I assume you are talking about a publicly traded company listed on a major stock exchange and the buyer resides in the US. Private companies and nonUS locations can change the rules really a lot. The short answer is no, because the company does not own the stock, various investors do. Each investor has to make an individual decision to sell or not sell. But there are complications. If an entity buys more than about 10 of the company they have to file a declaration with the SEC. The limit can be higher if they file an assertion that they are buying it solely for investment and are not seeking control of the company. If they are seeking control of the company then more paperwork must be filed and if they want to buy the whole company they may be required to make a tender offer where they offer to buy any and all shares at a specific price. If the company being bought is a financial institution, then the buyer may have to declare as a bank holding company and more regulations apply. The company can advise shareholders not to take the tender offer, but they cannot forbid it. So the short answer is, below 10 and for investment purposes only, it is cash and carry Whoever has the cash gets to carry the stock away. Above that various regulations and declarations apply, but the company still does not have the power prevent the purchase in most circumstances."

    "body": "There are many different kinds of SEC filings with different purposes. Broadly speaking, what they have in common is that they are the ways that companies publicly disclose information that they are legally required to disclose. The page that you listed gives brief descriptions of many types, but if you click through to the articles on individual types of filings, you can get more info. One of the most commonly discussed filings is the 10K, which is, as Wikipedia says, \"a comprehensive summary of a companys financial performance\". This includes info like earnings and executive pay. One example of a form that some people believe has potential utility for investors is Form 4, which is a disclosure of \"insider trading\". People with a privileged stake in a company executives, directors, and major shareholders cannot legally buy or sell shares without disclosing it by filing a Form 4. Some people think that you can make use of this information in the sense that if, for instance, the CEO of Google buys a bunch of Twitter stock, they may have some reason for thinking it will go up, so maybe you should buy it too. Whether such inferences are accurate, and whether you can garner a practical benefit from them i.e., whether you can manage to buy before everyone else notices and drives the price up is debatable. My personal opinion would be that, for an average retail investor, readng SEC filings is unlikely to be useful. The reason is that an average retail investor shouldnt be investing in individual companies at all, but rather in mutual funds or ETFs, which typically provide comparable returns with far less risk. SEC filings are made by individual companies, so it doesnt generally help you to read them unless youre going to take action related to an individual company. It doesnt generally make sense to take action related to an individual company if you dont have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings to decide which company to take action on. If you have the time and energy to read a large number of SEC filings, youre probably not an average retail investor. If you are a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues, you might benefit from reading SEC filings. However, if you arent already reading SEC filings, youre probably not a wheeler dealer who plays in the big leagues. That said, if youre a currentlyaverage investor with big dreams, it could be instructive to read a few filings to explore what you might do with them. You could, for instance, allocate a \"play money\" fund of a few thousand dollars and try your hand at following insider trades or the like. If you make some money, great if not, oh well. Realistically, though, there are so many people who make a living reading SEC filings and acting on them every day that you have little chance of finding a \"diamond in the rough\" unless you also make a living by doing it every day. Its sort of like asking \"Should I read Boating Monthly to improve my sailing skills?\" If youre asking because you want to rent a Hobie Cat and go for a pleasure cruise now and then, sure, it cant hurt. If youre asking because you want to enter the Americas Cup, you can still read Boating Monthly, but it wont in itself meaningfully increase your chances of winning the Americas Cup."

If your cal state tax is enough to put you into itemized deductions, your mortgage and property tax are a write off, and the 3k will actually be closer to the 2K you are considering for rent. The wild card as I see it is that your budget is so tight that any unforeseen expenses will be charged. As a long time homeowner, I know these expenses sometime appear to be high, and regular, despite their random nature.

If the IRS determines that youre claiming more allowances than youre eligible for and not paying the proper taxes throughout the year, they will hit you with an underpayment penalty fee, which would likely negate the benefits of keeping that money in the first place.

    "header": "How can I save on closing costs when buying a home?",
    "body": "Mostly ditto Pete Bs answer. Theres little you can do about closing costs. Some closing costs are government fees. Theres nothing you can do about this. Sad and unfair as it is, taxes are not optional and not generally negotiable. Title insurance and fire insurance are required by the lender. Even if youre paying cash, you dont really want to skip on these. If your house burns down and you have no insurance ... well, if youre worried about saving a few hundred on your closing costs, I assume that losing 200,000 because your house burned down and you have no insurance would be a pretty bad thing. Title insurance protects you against the possibility that the seller doesnt really legally own the property, maybe a scam, more likely a mistake or a technicality. You can, and certainly should, shop around for a better deal on insurance. Last couple of housing transactions I made, title insurance was a onetime fee of around 200. Im sure this depends on the cost of the house, where you live, maybe other factors. Maybe by shopping around I could have saved 10 or 20, but I doubt theres someone out there charging 50 when everyone else is charging 200. Fire insurance youre probably paying a couple of thousand a year, more opportunity for savings. Typically the buyer and the seller each have a realtor and they split the fee. If you go without a realtor but the seller hires one, shell keep the entire fee. So the only way to avoid this expense is if neither of you has a realtor. Ive never done that. Realtors cost a ton of money but they provide a useful service not only helping you find a house but also knowing how to deal with all the paperwork. Plenty of people do it, though. I presume they get the title agency or the bank or somebody to help with the paperwork. There are also discount realtors out there who dont show your home, do little or nothing to market it, basically just help you with the paperwork, and then charge a very low fee. Timing closing for a certain day of the month can reduce what you owe at closing time  by reducing the amount of interest you pay on the first months loan payment  but it doesnt save you any money. Youll make it up over the course of the loan. You might possibly save some money by timing closing around when property taxes are due. Theoretically this shouldnt matter the theory is that they prorate property taxes between buyer and seller so each pays the taxes for the time when they own the house. So again, you might need less cash at closing but youll make it up the next time property taxes are due. But the formulas the banks use on this are often goofy. Maybe if you live some place with high property taxes this is worth investigating. You could skip the inspection. But inspections Ive had done generally cost about 500. If they found something that was a major issue, they might save you from buying a house that would cost tens of thousands in repairs. Or less dramatically, you can use the inspection report for leverage with the seller to get repairs done at the sellers expense. I once had an inspector report problems with the roof and so I negotiated with the seller that they would pay for a percentage of roof repair. I suppose if youre buying a house that you know is run down and will require major work, an inspection might be superfluous. Or if you know enough about construction that you can do an inspection yourself. Otherwise, its like not buying insurance sure, you save a little up front, but youre taking a huge risk. So what can you control? a Shop around for fire insurance. Maybe save hundreds of dollars. b Find a seller whos not using a realtor and then you dont use a realtor either. Save big bucks, 6 to 7 in my area, but you then have to figure out how to do all the paperwork yourself and you severely limit your buying options as most sellers DO use a realtor. Besides that, theres not much you can do."

    "body": "The most likely answer to your question regarding what the market expects is perhaps that the market expects that currently LinkedIn like a lot of other startups has been plunging almost eveything it makes into building the business and brand. So right now the net profits are pretty low percentage of income roughly 1.5 of revenue Given the size of the other numbers, it doesnt take a lot of movement in the right direction to get a big change in that tiny final number. The other factor is the gap between their Net and the Income Available.. I think but Im making a logical guess here a large part of that gap was paying off the losses of the prior two years. If thats the case, and everything else is static, then next years available number ought to at least triple. In order to grow the net, all LI needs is to either continue current trends of growth in expenses relative to costs, keep expenses steady and experience a slight growth in income, or find a way to reduce expenses without having it impact income. Or something in between those three. If we take the first case as an example, income has been roughly doubling every year, but expenses growing less than that. if they were to continue that, but manage to get some economy of scale and have expenses grow at a slower rate, then the jump in net income ought to be substantial. most of the trends you could project end up with a big growth in the bottom line.. but yeah I gotta admit, none of that gets you 117X growth in a single year. So the conclusion I would draw is that the market is trending a few years out and being pretty optimistic given the current PE ratio. Of course you could also conclude that the market is social network happy and LNKD represents one of the few opportunities for the average investor to get in on that given that facebook and myspace are not trading on the open market"

Theres risk with any stock purchase, one can claim no stock is safe. Either way, your proposal juices the effect to creating twice the risk. Edit  After the conversation with Victor, let me add these thoughts. The \"RiskFree\" rate is generally defined to be the 1yr tbill and of course the risk of Gov default is not zero. Theres the SP 500 index which has a beta of 1 and is generally viewed as a decent index for comparison. You propose to use margin, so your risk, if done with an SP index is twice that of the 1X SP investor. However, you wont buy SP but stocks with such a high yield I question their safety.

    "body": "I think the one single answer is that the answer depends on the two countries involved and their banks practices. To find that answer, you need to ask other expats from your country living in France and ask them for their experience. Note that most expats do not know what fees they are paying. For example, in the Philippines, the lowest fee charged still involves waiting 30 days to get your money. Specifically, I opened a US dollar savings account with the minimum of US 500 required other rules are involved for opening a bank account, deposited a personal check drawn on my US bank account no fee charged, and waited 30 calendar days to withdraw USD bills. The Philippines bank did not have a branch in the US, but had financial arrangements with US banks. After getting USD dollars in my hand, I walked to a nearby exchange business store which usually offered a better daily rate than a bank, but a rate between the banks buy and sell rates and exchange the dollars for pesos. Note that years ago, banks did not give USD bills, when dollars were scarce in the Philippines. However, this process does not work in Thailand, due to bank rules against private individuals opening a USD account, with exceptions. And there are still fees involved. March 2017"

Get rid of those you have any way you can, and then never ever do it again. Thats the kind of crap that got us into the housing bubble mess to begin with. Especially with the rates as low as now, the only future with ARMBaloon is that youre going to pay more, way more, than your initial period payments. Rates  the rates now are very low. They were even lower 1224 months ago, but are still extremely low. Make sure you get a fixed rate loan, in order to lock these rates in for the remainder of the loan. Any ARM loan will have higher rates in the future. So go with FIXED RATE. Period  fixed rate loans are given for periods up to 30 years. The shorter the period, the lower the rate. However, at the level theyre now, youre practically getting money for free the APR is comparable to the inflation even for 30 yrfixed loans. PMI  private mortgage insurance  since you dont have much equity, the lender is likely to require you paying PMI. This is a significant amount of money you pay until you have at least 20 equity. It changes from lender to lender, so shop around and compare. Government assistance  thats what the broker was referring to. There were programs allowing people refinance even underwater mortgages. Check what programs are still available in your area. Some banks will not refinance with less than 20 equity, but some government assistance programs may help you get a loan even if you dont have enough equity. Closing fees and points  thats the money out of your pocket. Shop around, these vary wildly. Generally, Credit Unions, being nonprofits, are cheaper on this item specifically, while comparable to big banks on everything else."

More often than not, they take the optout approach, meaning that if you dont say you want out of the class it is assumed that you agree with the complaints as defined in the class action and would like to receive your portion of the money if there is a settlement. If you havent gotten such a letter and you think you should have, it is a good idea to contact the law firm. How do you find the law firm? Usually some Googling on \"class action\" and the name of the defendant company will get you there. Also, check the legal section of the classifieds of the local newspaper, they sometimes advertise them there. Typically they arent hard to find because it is in the law firms best interest to have everyone sign on to their class action for a number of reasons including If you have a lot of people who are supposedly aggrieved, it makes the defendant look more likely to be guilty, and more participants can equate to higher settlement amounts for which the law firm gets a percentage. That is why you see nonstop ads on daytime TV for lawyers marketing class action cases and looking for people who took this drug, or had that hip implant. Once a settlement occurs and you are a member of that class, there are a number of ways you might get your piece including  A credit to your account.  A check in the mail.  A coupon or some other consideration for your damages lame  A promise that they will stop doing the bad thing and maybe some changes in your favor on the terms of your account.

Will that advantage of positive thinking lead to higher earnings? Its possible. The old testament book of proverbs gives many sound words of advice.

Course it is worth noting that if a company isnt generating positive earnings this can be a less than useful tool, e.g. Amazon in the 1990s lost money every quarter and thus would have had a NA for a PE. PEG would use PE and earnings growth as a way to see if a stock is overvalued based on projected growth. If a company has a high PE but has a high earnings growth rate then that may prove to be worth it. By using the growth rate, one can get a better idea of the context to that figure.

    "body": "Another possibility is that a lot of it is bought using borrowed money. Especially if much of your own money is in the stock market, it may be beneficial to take out a loan to buy something compared to selling other assets to raise the same amount of cash. Even going by the likely relatively conservative 200Kyear before taxes, you are looking at a very nice house going for perhaps around 35 years worth of pretax income. Lets say you have good contacts at the bank and can secure a loan for 500K at 3.5 interest not at all unreasonable if you make half that before taxes in a single year and purchase something that can be used as collateral for the money borrowed with a bit of negotiating, I wouldnt be surprised if one could push the interest rate even lower, and stock in a publicly traded company can also trivially be used as collateral. Thats less than 1500month in interest, before any applicable tax effects  less than 10 of the beforetax income. And like Victor wrote, I think its reasonable to say that especially if the company is publicly traded, the CEO makes more than 200Kyear. Given an income of 200Kyear and assuming 30 taxes on that amount the marginal tax would likely be higher, and this includes e.g. interest expense deductions, the money left over after taxes and interest payments on a 500K 3.5 debt is still about 10Kmonth. Even with a pretty rapid amortization schedule and even if the actual tax rate is higher, that leaves quite a bit of money to be socked away in savings and other investments."

    "body": "Because it takes 3 business days for the actual transfer of stock to occur after you buy or sell to the next owner, your cash is tied up until that happens. This is called the settlement period. Therefore, brokers offer \"margin\", which is a form of credit, or loan, to allow you to keep trading while the settlement period occurs, and in other situations unrelated to the presented question. To do this you need a \"margin account\", you currently have a \"cash account\". The caveat of having a retail margin account distinct from a professional margin account is that there is a limited amount of sameday trades you can make if you have less than 25,000 in the account. This is called the Pattern Day Trader PDT rule. You dont need 25k to day trade, you will just wish you had it, as it is easy to get your account frozen or downgraded to a cash account. The way around THAT is to have multiple margin accounts at different brokerages. This will greatly increase the number of same day trades you can make. Many brokers that offer a \"solution\" to PDT to people that dont have 25k to invest, are offering professional trading accounts, which have additional fees for data, which is free for retail trading accounts. This problem has nothing to do with So be careful of the advice you get on the internet. It is mostly white noise. Feel free to verify"

By allowing themselves only two trips, they control the money spent. Bring it in cash and stop buying when you run out. On the other hand in my family we shop sales. When we determine that we need something we wait until we find a sale. When we see an exceptionally good sale on something we know we will need basic work dress shoes, for example, well purchase it and save it until the existing item it is replacing has worn out. Our strategy is to know what we need and buy it when the price is right. We tend to wait on anything that isnt on sale until we can find the right item at a price we like, which sometimes means stretching the existing piece of clothing it is replacing until well after its prime. If youve got a list youre shopping from, you know what you need. The question becomes how will you control your spending best? Carefully shopping sales and using coupons, or budgeting for a spree within limits?"

The total amount you will have paid is 60048  28,800. If you currently have money sitting in the bank earning only a negligible amount of interest, and you can purchase the house for X, and then sell it for exactly what you paid 4 years from now, and you have 0 expenses otherwise, then purchasing it will save you 28,800 compared to renting. Obviously that makes some assumptions which are not possible. Now you need to calculate the variables All of these variables can drastically effect the profit margin, and unfortunately they will vary greatly depending on your country, location, and the condition of the home. Once you estimate each of the variables, its important to realize that if you purchase, your profit or loss can swing unexpectedly in either direction based on appreciationdepreciation which can be difficult to predict, in part because it is somewhat tied to the overall macroeconomy of where you live state or country. On the flip side, if you rent, its pretty easy to calculate your cost as approximately 28,800 over 4 years. Perhaps slightly more for modest rent increases. Lastly, if you elect to purchase the house, realize that youre investing that money in real estate. You could just as easily rent and invest that money elsewhere, if you want to choose a more aggressive or conservative investment with your money."

Most good rewards cards can get you anywhere from 12 cash back on ALL purchases, and sometimes more on other categories. Again, assuming you can pay the balance in full each month, and you are good at budgeting money, using a credit card is an easy way to basically discount 12 of all of the spending you put on your card. AGAIN  this only works to your advantage if you pay off the credit card in full using the above example of 20 interest, thats about 1.6 interest if the interest compounds monthly, which wipes out your return on rewards if you just go one month without paying off the balance."

If you cant think of any obvious beneficiary for an insurance policy, than you probably dont need one. \"Dependents\" here should be understood broadly. It wouldnt necessarily be limited to wife and children. If youre the only support for your handicapped cousin, for example, you might want to provide for him. But I take it from your question that you have no such special case. Of course even if you have no dependents now, you might pick some up in the future. And if and when that does happen, your medical situation may have changed, making it difficult to get life insurance. But if you have no immediate plans so that any such even is likely to be far away, a serious alternative to consider would be to invest the money you would have paid in insurance premiums. Then if someday you do acquire dependents, you have a pot of money set aside to provide for them in case something happens to you. If its not enough and you can get insurance at that time, then great, but if you cant get insurance, at least theres something. If you never do acquire dependents, you can consider that pot of money part of your retirement fund."

    "body": "is it worth it? You state the average yield on a stock as 23, but seem to have come up with this by looking at the yield of an SP500 index. Not every stock in that index is paying a dividend and many of them that are paying have such a low yield that a dividend investor would not even consider them. Unless you plan to buy the index itself, you are distorting the possible income by averaging in all these \"duds\". You are also assuming your income is directly proportional to the amount of yield you could buy right now. But thats a false measure because you are talking about building up your investment by contributing 2k3kmonth. No matter what asset you choose to invest in, its going to take some time to build up to assets producing 20kyear income at that rate. Investments today will have time in market to grow in multiple ways. Given you have some time, immediate yield is not what you should be measuring dividends, or other investments, on in my opinion. Income investors usually focus on YOC Yield On Cost, a measure of income to be received this year based on the purchase price of the asset producing that income. If you do go with dividend investing AND your investments grow the dividends themselves on a regular basis, its not unheard of for YOC to be north of 6 in 10 years. The same can be true of rental property given that rents can rise. Achieving that with dividends has alot to do with picking the right companies, but youve said you are not opposed to working hard to invest correctly, so I assume researching and teaching yourself how to lower the risk of picking the wrong companies isnt something youd be opposed to. I know more about dividend growth investing than I do property investing, so I can only provide an example of a dividend growth entry strategy Many dividend growth investors have goals of not entering a new position unless the current yield is over 3, and only then when the company has a long, consistent, track record of growing EPS and dividends at a good rate, a low debtcashflow ratio to reduce risk of dividend cuts, and a good moat to preserve competitiveness of the company relative to its peers. Amongst many other possible measures. They then buy only on dips, or downtrends, where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal PE at the same time that they have faith that theyve valued the company correctly for a 3 year, or longer, hold time. There are those who selfreport that theyve managed to build up a 20k dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years. Check out Dividend Growth Investors blog for an example. Theres a whole world of Dividend Growth Investing strategies and writings out there and the commenters on his blog will lead to links for many of them. I want to point out that income is not just for those who are old. Some people planned, and have achieved, the ability to retire young purely because theyve built up an income portfolio that covers their expenses. Assuming you want that, the question is whether stock assets that pay dividends is the type of investment process that resonates with you, or if something else fits you better. I believe the OP says theyd prefer long hold times, with few activities once the investment decisions are made, and isnt dissuaded by significant work to identify his investments. Both real estate and stocks fit the latter, but the subtypes of dividend growth stocks and handsoff property investing which I assume means paying for a property manager are a better fit for the former. In my opinion, the biggest additional factor differentiating these two is liquidity concerns. Posttax stock accounts are going to be much easier to turn into emergency cash than a real estate portfolio. Whether thats an important factor depends on personal situation though."

If you offer it for 5000 the trading volume is going to be around zero. Since the supply of lemonade is presumably limited at some point dropping the price further isnt going to increase the number of transactions. Trade volumes reflect to some degree the difference of valuations between buyers and sellers and the supply and demand. Its another piece of information that you can try looking at and interpreting.

The bank knows that if they just offer the unprofitablly high interest rate or other perks with no strings attatched that people will open the account and dump a bunch of savings in it but wont actually move their financial life over, their old bank will still be their main bank. So they attatch strings like a required minimum deposit, a minimum number of direct debits and similar. These have minimal effect on people actually using the account as their main current account while being a pain for people trying to game the system.

    "body": "This article has a section titled \"Do you need an umbrella policy to cover your personal liability risks?\" that says If you have young children, for example, you might need a policy because they have lots of friends. These little tikes might get into some mischief and hurt themselves at your home. If so, youre at risk of being sued. Do you have people over often? Do you drive like a maniac or a Parisian? Do you have firearms on your premises? Do you have gardeners and housekeepers on the grounds? All these are reasons why you might want to own an umbrella policy. Although many people in the US are homeowners, parents, drivers, etc., not everyone falls into these categories. For some people, as low as the premiums for such a policy might be, the expected cost outweighs the expected benefit. The cost of a lawsuit may be extremely high, but someone may feel that the chance of a lawsuit being filed against them is low enough to be safely ignored and not worth insuring against. Im probably not a great example, but Ill use my own situation anyway. Even though a liability policy probably wouldnt cost me too much, Im almost certain that I wouldnt derive any benefit from it. I live alone without children or firearms, pet tigers, gardeners, etc. in a 520 sq. ft. apartment, so the probability that something bad would happen to someone on the small bit of property that I rent and that they would file a sizable lawsuit against me is small enough that I choose to ignore it."

    "body": "It is worth noting first that Real Estate is by no means passive income. The amount of effort and cost involved maintenance, legal, advertising, insurance, finding the properties, ect. can be staggering and require a good amount of specialized knowledge to do well. The amount you would have to pay a management company to do the work for you especially with only a few properties can wipe out much of the income while you keep the risk. However, keshlams answer still applies pretty well in this case but with a lot more variability. One million dollars worth of property should get you there on average less if you do much of the work yourself. However, real estate because it is so local and done in 100k chunks is a lot more variable than passive stocks and bonds, for instance, as you can get really lucky or really unlucky with location, the local economy, natural disasters, tenants... Taking out loans to get you to the million worth of property faster but can add a lot more risk to the process. Including the risk you wouldnt have any money on retirement. Investing in Real Estate can be a faster way to retirement than some, but it is more risky than many and definitely not passive."

    "header": "Why invest in becoming a landlord?",
    "body": "Let me add a few thoughts that have not been mentioned so far in the other answers. Note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use, not for renting out theres a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 years cold rents it is considered rather expensive. I dont know how localized this rule of thumb is, but I know it for Germany which is apparently the OPs country, too. There are obviously differences between buying a houseflat for yourself and in order to rent it out. As others have said, maintenance is a major factor for house owners  and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs  which is closely related to financial risk exposure, e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your daytime job?. This plays a crucial role for landlords I know theyre all smallscale landlords, and most of them do put in substantial work themselves I know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live. Some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats, another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case. I also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that nice kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants dont move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance. My personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment i.e. not for immediate or future personal use Id say that the exact circumstances are very important if you are stably based in a region where the buyingtorentalprice ratio is favorable, you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house closeby then why not. If this is not the case, some other form of investing in real estate may be better. On the other hand, investing in further real estate closeby where you live in your own house means increased lump risk  you miss diversification into regions where the value of real estate may develop very differently. There is one important psychological point that may play a role with the observed relation between being rich and being landlord. First of all, remember that the median wealth without pensions for Germany is about 51 k, and someone owning a morgagefree 150 k flat and nothing else is somewhere in the 7th decile of wealth. To put it the other way round the question whether to invest 150 k into becoming a landlord is of practical relevance only for rich in terms of wealth people. Also, asking this question is typically only relevant for people who already own the home they live in as buying for personal use will typically have a better return than buying in order to rent. But already people who buy for personal use are on average wealthier or at least on the track to become more wealthy in case of fresh home owners than people who rent. This is attributed to personal characteristics and the fact that the downpayment of the mortgage enforces saving behaviour which is typically kept up once the house is paid, and is anyways found to be more pronounced than for nonhouseowners. In contrast, many people who decide never to buy a home fall short of their initial savingsinvestment plans e.g. putting the 150 k into an ETF for the next 21 years and in the end spend considerably more money  and this group of people rarely invests into directly becoming a landlord. Assuming that you can read German, heres a relevant newspaper article and a related press release."

You already lost the money you lost, and theres no point in trying to \"win it back\" as opposed to just investing the money you still have as wisely as possible, forgetting your former fortune. Furthermore, the specific strategy you suggest is not a good one. The problem is that youre assuming that, whenever the stock hits 2, it will eventually rebound to 3. While that may often happen, its far from guaranteed. More specifically, assuming the efficient market hypothesis applies which it almost certainly does, there are theorems that say you cant increase your expected earning with a strategy like the one you propose the apparent stability of the steady stream of income is offset by the chance that you lose out if the stock does something you didnt anticipate."

    "body": "Title insurance protects you from losing rights to your property in case of a court decision. Lets look at an example I recently found in local newspapers. One old woman sold her apartment to person A. The deed was attested by a notary public who verified that indeed in was that old woman putting her signature on the deed. Then person A sold the apartment to person B, etc, then after several deals some unfortunate Buyer bought that apartment. The deal looked allright, so hes got a mortgage to pay for the apartment. Later it turned out that the old lady died three months before she \"sold\" the apartment and the notary public was corrupt. Old ladys heirs filed a lawsuit and the deal was void. So the ultimate Buyer lost all rights to the apartment although he purchased it legally. This is the case when title insurance kicks in. You need one if theres a chance for a deal to be deemed void."

Simple as long as you own a house, you wont ever have to pay rent you do have to pay taxes and maintenance, of course. You have a guaranteed return on investment, and the best part is because its not money you earn but money you dont have to spend, its tax free. Even if the house loses value over time, you still come out ahead.

    "header": "What happens to the original funds when a certified bank check is not cashed?",
    "body": "The answer probably varies with local law, and you havent said where youre located. In most or all US states, it appears that after some statutory length of time, the bank would transfer the money to the state government, where it would be held indefinitely as \"unclaimed property\" in the name of the recipient technically, the payee, the person to whom the check is made payable. This process is called escheatment. Most states publish a list of all unclaimed property, so at some later date the payee could find their name on this list, and realize they were entitled to the funds. There would then be a process by which the payee could claim the funds from the state. Usually the state keeps any interest earned on the money. As far as I know, there typically wouldnt be any way for you, the person who originated the payment, to collect the money after escheatment. Before escheatment, if you have the uncashed check in your possession, you can usually return it to the bank and have it refunded to you. I had trouble finding an authoritative source explaining this, but a number of informal sources found by Googling \"cashier check escheatment\" seem to agree that this is generally how it works. Here is the web site for a law firm, saying that in California an uncashed cashiers check escheats to the state after 3 years. Until escheatment occurs, the recipient can cash the check at any time. I dont think that cashiers checks become \"stale\" like personal checks do, and there isnt any situation in which the funds would automatically revert to you."

    "body": "Why does the rising price of a bond pushes its yield down? The bond price and its yield are linked if one goes up, the other must go down. This is because the cash flows from the bond are fixed, predetermined. The market price of the bond fluctuates. Now what if people are suddenly willing to pay more for the same fixed payments? It must mean that the return, i.e. the yield, will be lower. Here we see that risk associated with the bonds in question has skyrocketed, and thus bonds returns has skyrocketed, too. Am I right? The default risk has increased, yes. Now, I assume that bonds price is determined by the market issued by a state, traded at the market. Is that correct? Correct, as long as you are talking about the market price. Then who determines bonds yields? I mean, isnt it fixed? Or  in the FT quote above  they are talking about the yields for the new bonds issued that particular month? The yield is not fixed  the cash flows are. Yield is the internal rate of return.

    "body": "Yes, the De Beers Group of Companies is a diamond cartel that had complete control of the diamond market for most of the 20th century. They still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing particularly with the slogan \"A Diamond is Forever\" has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society. The intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect, but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds. The larger the diamond, the more likely it is to have flaws, so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 carats or greater, you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones. Some other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by patenting a specific cut that they design. This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut. Diamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute. In the years to come, you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers prices."

There are various online services to see the average price paid, as well as the low outliers. Ive looked at truecar.com for instance to see what others have paid within 50 miles of my zipcode. I think the only way for you to know youre being offered a good deal is to see if any of the other dealers that have not responded are willing to talk when you offer them 22,300 which the dealer above suggested was breakeven point. If none of them respond, then you know youre really at the bottom of the negotiating window. If one of them does respond, then you can go back to that internet sales manager and ask why another dealership do not disclose which one is willing to sell it to you for less than 22,400 do not disclose how much lower they offered to sell it for. In my experience, most dealers will sell at or just below the breakeven price at the end of the quarter so that they can beat other dealerships out for the quota. That gives you a week and a half to find the bottom price before going in on New Years Eve to seal the deal."

That will get it out of your head...your subconscious will not keep bugging you about it because its not worried about forgetting it. Save the discount code in the list so you know you will have it if you ever want it. Put other things that you are unlikely to do any time soon on that same list. Then move on with your life and enjoy your freedom from useless and expensive clutter. I use online TODO lists also google docs for keeping track of things Im supposed to be doing. One of my lists, \"long term purchases,\" contains a bunch of expensive stuff that I have wanted at some point but not gotten around to purchasing. I think the list has saved me a lot of money.

    "body": "Adapted from an answer to a somewhat different question. Generally, 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you roll over your 401k investments into an IRA. So, unless you have specific reasons for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan e.g. you have access to investments that are not available to nonparticipants and you think those investments are where you want your money to be, roll over your 401k assets into an IRA. But I dont think that is the case here. If you had a Traditional 401k, the assets will roll over into a Traditional IRA if it was a Roth 401k, into a Roth IRA. If you had started a little earlier, you could have considered considered converting part or all of your Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA assuming that your 2012 taxable income will be smaller this year because you have quit your job. Of course, this may still hold true in 2013 as well. As to which custodian to choose for your Rollover IRA, I recommend investing in a lowcost index mutual fund such as VFINX which tracks the SP 500 Index. Then, do not look at how that fund is doing for the next thirty years. This will save you from the common error made by many investors when they pull out at the first downturn and thus end up buying high and selling low. Also, do not chase after exchangetraded mutual funds or ETFs as many will likely recommend until you have acquired more savvy or interest in investing than you are currently exhibiting. Not knowing which company stock you have, it is hard to make a recommendation about selling or holding on. But since you are glad to have quit your job, you might want to consider making a clean break and selling the shares that you own in your exemployers company.

In general, I like the idea of relating to the kids situations as much as possible. When my daughter 14 makes a purchase, Id ask her to be aware of how many hours she had to work to make the money she plans to spend. Was it worth 4 hours babysitting to buy an iPad case? Was it worth 2 to buy lunch that we could have made you at home? Note, the convert price to hours worked is a concept that works great when teaching budgeting to anyone, not just kids. The math of tax and discounts for comparison shopping works great as well so long as they understand value. A 400 sweatshirt at 50 off isnt really a bargain, in my opinion.

The reason people have a bad or no credit score is often because theyre new to the country, have just turned 18, have previously fallen into arrears or are just bad with money. Getting a credit card is risky because, if you dont stay on top of your payments, itll just damage your score even more. Now, it sounds like I hate credit cards  but I dont, and they do have their benefits. But avoid them if possible because they can be more hassle than theyre worth ie, paying the credit back ontime, cancelling accounts when the interest comes in, moving money in and out of accounts. Its risky borrowing money from anywhere whether its a payday lender, a bank, a credit card, etc., so use them as a last resort. If youve got your own income then thats amazing!, try not to live outside of your means and your credit score will look after and increase itself. It takes time to build a good credit score, but always make sure you pay the people you owe on time and the full amount. Id stick with paying your phone provider and any other direct debits you have setup and avoid getting a credit card. Id recommend Noddle to keep track of your credit score and read their FAQ on how to help build it. Unlike Experian, its free forever so not quite as detailed... but Noddle are owned by CallCredit  one of the biggest Credit Reference Agencies in the UK so they should have the latest information on yourself. In conclusion, if you already have financial commitments like a mobile phone bill, gym membership, store cards, anything that gets paid monthly by direct debit... your credit score will increase provided you pay the fullamount on time.

    "header": "Assessed value of my house",
    "body": "I had the same thing happen to my house. I bought it in 2011 for 137,000, which was the same as the FHA appraised value because FHA wont guarantee a loan for more than their appraiser thinks its worth. January of last year, I get the letter from the tax office and see that my house has been assessed at only 122,000. I was shocked too, until I read a similar document that Phil told you to read. The short of it is, no matter what the tax assessor calls their calculation, it is an assessment. It was massproduced along with everyone elses in your neighborhood by looking at its specs on paper acreage, house square footage, age, bedsbaths and by driving by your home to see its general condition. The fact that your lawn may be less wellkept than the last time they drove by could have affected the decision a little. Its very unlikely to have been a major determinant of the assessment. The assessment value affects taxes, and taxes only. It is, in most states, a matter of public record, and so it could be used by a potential buyer to negotiate a lower price. However, everyone in the housing business knows that the assessed value is not the market value, and the buyers agent will be encouraging their client to make a more realistic bid. This \"assessed value\" is not an \"appraisal value\". An appraisal is done by someone actually walking into and through your home, inspecting the general condition inside and out, to try to make a fair evaluation of what the home is actually worth. That number is almost always going to be more than the assessment value, because it takes into account all the amenities of the home the current fixtures, the wellkept or recentlyreplaced flooring, the energyefficient HVAC and hot water system, etc etc. It also takes into account recent comparables what have other houses, with the same general statistics, the same amenities, relatively close in location, sold for recently? That will still generally be different from the true market value of the home. That value is nothing more or less than what a potential buyer will pay to have it at the time you decide to sell it, and that in turn depends 100 on your potential buyers myriad situations. Someone may lowball even the assessed value because theyre looking for a deal and hoping youre desperate you just reject the offer. Someone may be looking at comparables indicating the house is maybe overpriced by 10k. You can counter and try to come to an agreement. Or, your potential buyer could work five minutes from your house, and be willing to pay at or above your asking price because the next best possibility is another 10 miles away. Since you arent looking to sell the home, none of this matters, except to determine any escrow payments you might be making towards property taxes. Just keep making your mortgage payment, and dont worry about it. If you really wanted to, you could petition the state for a second opinion, but you think the value should be higher if they agree with you, theyll raise the assessed value and youll pay more in taxes. Why in the world would you want to do that?"

    "body": "You cannot actually buy an index in the true sense of the word. An index is created and maintained by a company like Standard and Poors who licenses the use of the index to firms like Vanguard. The SP 500 is an example of an index. The SP 500 \"index includes 500 leading companies\", many finical companies sell products which track to this index. The two most popular products which track to indexes are Mutual Funds as called Index Funds and Index Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds as called ETFs. Each Index Mutual Fund or ETF has an index which it tracks against, meaning they hold securities which make up a sample of the index some indexes like bond indexes are very hard to hold everything that makes them up. Looking at the Vanguard SP 500 Index Mutual Fund ticker VFINX we see that it tracks against the SP 500 index. Looking at its holdings we see the 500ish stocks that it holds along with a small amount of bonds and cash to handle cash flow for people buying and sell shares. If we look at the Vanguard SP 500 ETF ticker VOO we see that it also tracks against the SP 500 index. Looking at its holdings we see they are very similar to the similar Index Mutual Fund. Other companies like T. Rowe Price have similar offering. Look at the T. Rowe Price Equity Index 500 Fund ticker PREIX its holdings in stocks are the same as the similar Vanguard fund and like the Vanguard fund it also holds a small amount of bonds and cash to handle cash flow. The only real difference between different products which track against the same index is in the expense ratio fees for managing the fund and in the small differences in the execution of the funds. For the most part execution of the funds do not really matter to most people it has a very small effect, what matters is the expense the fees paid to own the fund. If we just compare the expense ratio of the Vanguard and T. Rowe Price funds we see as of 27 Feb 2016 Vanguard has an expense ratio of 0.17 for it Index Mutual Fund and 0.05 for its ETF, while T. Rowe Price has an expense ratio of 0.27. These are just the fees for the funds themselves, there are also account maintenance fees which normally go down as the amount of money you have invested at a firm go up and in the case of ETFs execution cost cost to trade the shares along with the difference between the bid and ask on the shares. If you are just starting out I would say going with the Index Mutual Fund would easier and most likely would cost less overall if you are buying a small amount of shares every month. When choosing a company look at the expense ratio on the funds and the account maintenance fees along with the account minimals. Vanguard is well known for having low fees and they in fact were the first to offer Index Mutual Funds. For more info on the SP 500 index see also this Investopedia entry on the SP 500 index. Do not worry if this is all a bit confusing it is to most people myself included at first."

    "header": "What is the Bernanke Twist and Operation Twist? What exactly does it do?",
    "body": "So \"Operation Twist\" is actually a pretty simple concept. Heres the break down The Fed sells shortterm treasury bonds that it already holds on its books. Shortterm treasury bonds refer to  bonds that mature in less than three years. Then Uses that money to buy long term treasury bonds. Longterm treasury bonds refer to  bonds that mature in six to 30 years The reason The fed buys these longerterm treasuries to lower longerterm interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending. Diving deeper into how it works So the Fed can easily determine shortterm rates by using the Federal funds rate this rate has a direct effect on the following However this does not play a direct role in influencing the rate of longterm loans what you might pay on a 30year fixed mortgage. Instead, longterm rates are determined by investors who buy and sell bonds in the bond market, which changes daily. These bond yields fluctuate depending on the health of the economy and inflation. However, the Fed funds rate does play an indirect role in these rates. So now that we know a little more about what effects what rate, why does lower longterm rates in treasuries influence my 30yr fixed mortgage? Well when you are looking for a loan you are entering a market and competing against other people, by people I mean anyone looking for money e.g my grandmother, companies, or the US government. The bank that lends you money has to decide weather the deal you are offering them is better then another deal on the market. If the risk of lending to one person is the same as the risk of lending to another, the bank will make whichever loan yields the higher interest rate. The U.S. government is considered a very safe borrower, so much so that government bonds are considered almost risk free, but because of the lower risk the rate of return is lower. So now the bank has to factor in this risk and make its decision weather to lend you money, or the government. So, if the government were to go to the market and buy its own longterm bonds it is adding demand in the market causing the price of the bond to rise in effect lowering the interest rate when price goes up, yield goes down. So when you go back and ask for a loan it has to reevaluate and decide \"Is it worth giving this money to Joe McFreeBeer instead and collecting a higher yield?\" After all, Joe McFreeBeer is a nice guy. Heres an example Lets say the US has a rating of 10 out of 10 and its bonds pay a 2 yield. Now lets say for each lower mark in rating the bank will lend at a minimum of 1 higher and your rating is 8 of 10. So if you go to market, the lowest rate you can get will be 4. Now lets say price rises on the US treasury and causes the rate to go down by 1. In this scenario you will now be able to get a loan for 3 and someone with a rating of 7 of 10 would be able to get that 4 loan.

    "body": "Because stock markets dont always go up, sometimes they go down. Sometimes they go way down. Between 2007 and 2009 the SP 500 lost over half its value. So if in 2007 you thought you had just enough to retire on, in 2009 youd suddenly find you had only half of what you needed! Of course over the next few years, many of the stocks recovered value, but if you had retired in 2008 and depended on a 401k that consisted entirely of stocks, youd have been forced to sell a bunch of stocks near the bottom of the market to cover your retirement living expenses. Bonds go up and down too, but usually not to the same extent as stocks, and ideally you arent selling the bonds for your living expenses, just collecting the interest thats due you for the year. Of course, some companies and cities went bankrupt in the 2008 crisis too, and they stopped making interest payments. Another risk is that you may be forced to retire before you were actually planning to. As you age you are at increasing risk for medical problems that may force an early retirement. Many businesses coped with the 2008 recession by laying off their older workers who were earning higher salaries. It wasnt an easy environment for older workers to find jobs in, so many folks were forced into early retirement. Nothing is risk free, so you need to make an effort to understand what the risks are, and decide which ones you are comfortable with."

In general, a golden cross consists of a short term MA that was previously below a long term MA crossing above that LT MA, however the most common reference will imply a 50200 day cross because this is considered as a stronger signal compared to shorter MAs. With that said, its important to realize that the golden cross is just one of many technical analysis \"signals\", and the entire field of technical analysis is considered controversial, to say the least.

You are correct that theres no cost to enter a contract though there may be broker fees and margin payments. Any difference between the contract price and the price of the index at settlement is what is exchanged at settlement. Its analogous to the bidask on a stock  the bid price represents the price at which someone is willing to \"buy\" a futures contract meaning enter into a long position and the ask is how much someone is willing to \"sell\" a contract.

Assuming the company is doing well, its share is now available in the market for 100 ea. Now lets say the company has made a profit of 1000 and this also gets factored into the price of 100. Lets say the company decides to keep this 1000 kept as Cash Reserve and is not distributed as dividends. In a share split say 11, the book value of each share is now reduced to 5, the number of shares increase to 200. The share capital stays at 2005  1000. The market value of shares come down to 50 ea. In a Bonus share issue say 11, the funds 1000 are moved from Cash Reserve and transferred to share capital. The book value of each share will remain same as 10, the number of shares increase to 200. The share capital increases to 20010  2000. The market value of shares come down to 50 ea. So essentially from a liquidity point of view both give the same benefit. As to why some companies issue bonus and not a split, this is because of multiple reasons. A split beyond a point cannot be done, ie 10 can be split to 1 ea but it doesnt look good to make it 0.50. The other reason is there is adequate cash reserve and you want to convert this into share holders capital. Having a larger share holders capital improves some of the health ratios for the compnay.

You may feel overqualified for the jobs based on the fact you just graduated from college but this was the type of job you should have had to bridge you from school to the job you want.

Lets start by understanding investing every month vs every three months. First compare holding cash for two months at 0 for most Canadians right now and then investing on the third month vs being invested in a single stock etf 5 annually?. At those rates she is forgoing equity returns of around These costs and the 10 for one big trade give total costs of 1681034 dollars. If you were to trade every month instead there would be no cost for not being invested and the trading costs over three months would just be 31030. So in this case it would be better to trade monthly instead of every three months. However, Im guessing you dont trade all 2000 into a single etf. The more etfs you trade the more trading more infrequently would be an advantage. You can redo the above calculations spliting the amount across more etfs and including the added trading costs to get a feel for what is best. You can also rotate as Jason suggests but that can leave you unbalanced temporarily if not done carefully. A second option would be to find a discount broker that allows you to trade the etfs you are interested in for free. This is not always possible but often will be for those investing in index funds. For instance I trade every month and have no brokerage costs. Dollar cost averaging and value averaging are for people investing a single large amount instead of regular monthly amounts. Unless the initial amount is much much larger than the monthly amounts this is probably not worth considering.

    "body": "Given your clarifying comment that youre asking about the length of stay rather than AirBnB in particular, Id say there is a decent chance there will be tax differences. The difference is unlikely to be in income tax, but many cities have local ordinances that impose transaction taxes on short stays. For instance, the town where I live has a \"transient occupancy tax\" for any paid stay of less than 31 days. Unfortunately, because these taxes are often levied by individual cities, its hard to know whether one applies in your case. One town may impose no tax while the town right next to it does impose a tax. Youll have to look at what your local laws are. This could be easy if your town has a nice comprehensive website about local laws if not you may have to do some deeper research. In any case, you should definitely look into it, since there could be penalities if there is a tax and the city finds out youre not paying it. As AirBnB has grown in popularity, many municipalities have begun to crack down on AirBnB renters who try to make money without paying taxes like a regular motel as well as conforming to other laws, e.g., running a business in a neighborhood zoned residential."

And while she may not be irresponsible, maybe the invisibility of it is good for her psychology? Its hers, so her comfort is important here. 2. Good. Make sure its explicitly listed on the policy. 3. Bad. I think it will as well, at least the long run. But, this is not a good reason for an emergency fund  the whole point of which is to be stable in case of emergencies. 4. Good. Identity theft is a concern, though unless her info is already \"out there\", its insufficient for the emergency fund. And besides, she could keep cash. Your points 1. Iffy. On the one hand, youre right. On the other hand, Cyprus. It is good to remember that money in accounts is in someone elses control, not yours, as the Cypriots found out to their chagrin. And of course, it cant happen here, but thats what they thought too. There is value in having some hard assets physically in your control. Think of it as an EMERGENCY emergency fund. Cash works too, but precious metals are better for these megaupheaval scenarios. Again, find out how having such an EMERGENCY fund would make her feel. Does having that give her some comfort? A gift from a family member of this much silver leads me to assume that her family might have a little bit of a prepper culture. If so, then even if she is not a prepper herself, she may derive some comfort from having it, just in case  itll be baked into her background. Definitely a topic to discuss with her. 2. Excellent point. This is precisely why you want your emergency fund in some form of cash. 3. Bad. You can walk into any pawn shop and sell it in a heartbeat. Or you can send it in to a company and have cash in days. 4. Bad. If you know a savings account that pays 34, please, please, please tell me where it is so I can get one. Fact is, all cash instruments pay negligible interest now, and all such savings are being eroded by inflation. 5. Maybe. There is value to looking at your net worth this way, but my experience has been that those that do take it way too far. I think theres more value at looking at allocation within a few broad \"buckets\"  emergency fund, savings car, house, college, etc, and retirement fund. If this is to be an EMERGENCY fund, as per point 1, then you should look at it as its own bucket and maybe add a little cash too. Another thought to add This is a gift from a family member  they gave her a lot of silver. Of course its your SOs now, and she can do whatever she wants with it, but how would the family member react if she did liquidate it? If that family member is a prepper, and gave her this with the emotional desire to see her prepped, they may be upset if she sold it. It just occurred to me this may be jewelry. Your SO may not have sentimental attachment to it, but what about the family members sentiments? They may not like to see family silver they loving maintained and passed on casually discarded for mere cash by your SO. Another thing to discuss with her. Wrap up Generally, you are right about not keeping a 6 month emergency fund in silver. But there are other factors to consider here. Theres also the fact that its already bought  the cost of buying paying over market has already been taken. Edit  so its silverware Ah, so its silverware. Well, scratch everything, except how the family member feels about, which now looms large. This doesnt have much value as an emergency fund. Nor really as an investment. If you did keep it as an investment, think of it as an investment in collectiblesart, less so in precious metals. If no one will get upset, Id say pick out the nicest set to keep for special occasions, and sell the rest. Find out first if it has collectible or historical value. It may be worth far more than the pure weight in silver. Ebay might be the way to go to sell it."

    "body": "Id suggest you avoid the Roth for now and use pretax accounts to get the greatest return. Id deposit to the 401k, enough to get as much match as permitted, then use a traditional IRA. You should understand how tax brackets work, and aim to use pretax to the extent it helps you avoid the 25 rate. If any incremental deposit would be 15 money, use Roth for that. Most discussions of the pretax  post tax decision talk about 2 rates. That at the time of deposit and time of withdrawal. There are decades in between that shouldnt be ignored. If you have any life change, a marriage, child, home purchase, etc, theres a chance your marginal bracket drops back down to 15. Thats the time to convert to Roth, just enough to \"top off\" the 15 bracket. Last, I wouldnt count on that pension, theres too much time until you retire to count on that income. Few people stay at one job long enough to collect on the promise of a pension that takes 30 years to earn, and even if you did, theres the real chance the company cancels the plan long before you retire."

I was tempted to put in 10 of my investments, not including the 6 month safety fund and not including equity in my home. Now thinking about this question, it seems that it depends on your income as a percentage of your investment income which should grow in proportion to the whole over time. For example Early stage of career, not much investment income 20 Mid career 5 Midlate career, moving to more safe investments 5 Late career, retirement 1 Another way to calculate would be as a percentage of the amount you put into retirement savings per year. Maybe 10 of this figure when youre young and 1 nearer to retirement."

Owners who are selling without an agent do not have to pay a sellers agent fee. The closing cost savings here are actually on the sellers side of the transaction. However, since you know the seller is saving money, you may be able to negotiate a lower overall selling price with them or it may be priced lower than comps already because of this factor. FSBO houses maybe trickier to find than those listed by an agent, because they will not appear on the national MLS used by realtors to findadvertise houses that arent being sold by their own clients. You may need to physically walk the streets of the neighborhood youre interested in moving to, to look for FSBO yard signs. FSBO sellers may also advertise in local newspapers."

Companies go bankrupt, government agencies are reorganized, and those hithertountouchable assets are destroyed overnight. So, treat your new investment strategy as if you were starting over, and invest accordingly, for example, aggressively for a few years, then progressively safer as you get older. There are other strategies too, depending on factors like your taste for risk you might prefer to be conservative until you reach some safety threshold to reach \"certain safety\" and then start making riskier investments.

    "body": "Lets look at some of your options In a savings account, your 40,000 might be earning maybe 0.5, if you are lucky. In a year, youll have earned 200. On the plus side, youll have your 40,000 easily accessible to you to pay for moving, closing costs on your new house, etc. If you apply it to your mortgage, you are effectively saving the interest on the amount for the life of the loan. Lets say that the interest rate on your mortgage is 4. If you were staying in the house longterm, this interest would be compounded, but since you are only going to be there for 1 year, this move will save you 1600 in interest this year, which means that when you sell the house and pay off this mortgage, youll have 1600 extra in your pocket. You said that you dont like to dabble in stocks. I wouldnt recommend investing in individual stocks anyway. A stock mutual fund, however, is a great option for investing, but only as a longterm investment. You should be able to beat your 4 mortgage, but only over the long term. If you want to have the 40,000 available to you in a year, dont invest in a mutual fund now. I would lean toward option 2, applying the money to the mortgage. However, there are some other considerations Do you have any other debts, maybe a car loan, student loan, or a credit card balance? If so, I would forget everything else and put everything toward one or more of these loans first. Do you have an emergency fund in place, or is this 40,000 all of the cash that you have available to you? One rule of thumb is that you have 3 to 6 months of expenses set aside in a safe, easily accessible account ready to go if something comes up. Are you saving for retirement? If you dont already have retirement savings in place and are adding to it regularly, some of this cash would be a great start to a Roth IRA or something like that, invested in a stock mutual fund. If you are already debt free except for this mortgage, you might want to do some of each Keep 10,000 in a savings account for an emergency fund if you dont already have an emergency fund, put 5,000 in a Roth IRA if you arent already contributing a satisfactory amount to a retirement account, and apply the rest toward your mortgage."

However, in the spirit of being helpful, and with the caveat that super high returns involve super high risk Ill try and point you in the direction where this is theoretically possible, even if the odds would be better buying lottery tickets. One way to get more leverage from your money than just buying stocks is to buy options. With an options strategy your returnloss will be magnified greatly compared to buying stocks.

This would render the value of your accounts worthless! As such, most countries have overwhelmingly avoided the taxation of ingame \"inventory\" because its not really definable. Instead, in game goods are only taxed when they are exchanged for local currency. This is considered a general sale. There may be tax codes in your region for the sale of \"digital goods\". Otherwise, it should be taxed as sale a standard good with no special stipulations. The bottom line is that you shouldnt expect to find much reliable information on this topic, on the internet.

To invest, you buy it through a stock broker, just as you would if you were buying an individual stock. When looking at a mutual fund based in the U.S., the easiest way to tell whether or not it is an ETF is by looking at the ticker symbol. Traditional mutual funds have ticker symbols that end in \"X\", and ETFs have ticker symbols that do not end in \"X\". The JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity Fund, with ticker symbol JFAMX, is a traditional mutual fund, not an ETF. JPMorgan does have ETFs the JPMorgan Diversified Return Emerging Markets Equity ETF, with ticker symbol JPEM, is an example. This ETF invests in similar stocks as JFAMX however, because it is an indexbased fund instead of an actively managed fund, it has lower fees. If you arent sure about the ticker symbol, the advertisingprospectus of any ETF should clearly state that it is an ETF. In the example of JPEM above, they put \"ETF\" right in the fund name. If you dont see ETF mentioned, it is most likely a traditional mutual fund. Another way to tell is by looking at the \"investment minimums\" of the fund. JFAMX has a minimum initial investment of 1000. ETFs, however, do not have an investment minimum listed because it is traded like a stock, you simply buy whole shares at whatever the current share price is. So if you look at the \"Fees and Investment Minimums\" section of the JPEM page, youll see the fees listed, but not any investment minimums."

    "header": "What is the benefit of investing in retirement plan versus investing directly in stocks yourself?",
    "body": "In the US, the key to understanding the benefits of retirement accounts is to understand capital gains taxes and how they work. Retirement accounts are designed for making investments throughout your career, then after several decades of contributions, withdrawing that money to pay for your needs when your fulltime employment has concluded. Normally when you invest money in a brokerage account, if the value of your investment increases, and you sell in less than a year, those investments are considered shortterm gains and taxed as ordinary income. If you hold that same investment for over a year, the same investment is taxed at a lower capital gains rate depending on which tax bracket you are in during that year, the amount due could be up to 20, but much lower than your regular income tax rate. When you place your money in a retirement account, you are choosing to either pay the tax due on the income when you put it in the account, or put the money in tax free and pay the tax when you withdraw these are called taxdeferred accounts. When you have money invested several decades, the raw dollar amount increases greatly, but inflation is also reducing the value of those dollars. Imagine you bought some bonds that payed 4 over 40 years, but inflation was 2 during those same years. When you sell those bonds 40 years later, you will owe capital gains on the entire gain even though half of the gain came from inflation. Retirement accounts allow you to buy and sell according to your investment needs and goals without any consideration about whether the gains are shortterm or longterm, and they also allow you to pay taxes just once, either when you put it in, or when you take it out, with no worries about whether youre paying taxes on inflated gains."

Some states may require that a certain amount of coverage is carried on a registered vehicle. However, you may be able to drop the collision, rental car, and other options from your policy saving you some money. So you buy a new car for cash 25K or so and store the thing. What happens if the car suffers damage during storage? Are you willing to save a few dollars to have the loss of an asset? You will have to insure the thing in some way and I bet if you buy the proper policy the amount save will be very minimal.

According to the data there, FOSFX outperformed FUSEX in 2012, FEMKX outperformed FUSED in 2010, and FWWFX outperformed FUSEX in both 2010 and 2012. When looking at 10 and 15year trailing returns, both FEMKX and FWWFX outperformed FUSEX. What does this mean? It means it matters what time period youre looking at. US stocks have been on an almost unbroken increase since early 2009. Its not surprising that if you look at recent returns, international markets will not stack up well. If you go back further, though, you can find periods where international funds outperformed the US and even within recent years, there have been individual years where international funds won. As for correlation, I guess it depends what you mean by \"low\". According to this calculator, for instance, FOSFX and FUSEX had a correlation of about 0.84 over the last 15 years. That may seem high, but its still lower than, say, the 0.91 correlation between FUSEX and FSLCX Fideltiy Small Cap. Its difficult to find truly low correlations among equity funds, since the interconnectedness of the global economy means that bull and bear markets tend to spread from one country to another. To get lower correlations you need to look at different asset classes e.g., bonds. So the answer is basically that some of the funds you were already looking at may be the ones you were looking for. The trick is that no category will outperform any other over all periods. Thats exactly what volatility means  it means the same category that overperforms in some periods will underperform in others. If international funds always outperformed, no one would ever buy US funds. Ultimately, if youre trying to decide on investments for yourself, you need to take all this information into account and combine it with your own personal preferences, risk tolerance, etc. Anecdotally, I recently did some simulationbased analyses of Vanguard funds using data from the past 15 years. Over this period, Vanguards emerging markets fund VEIEX comes out far ahead of US funds, and is also the leastcorrelated with the SP 500. But, again, this analysis is based only on a particular slice of time."

As a previous poster mentioned, there is a lot of \"white noise\" that occurs on a weeklydailyhourlymin basis. Longterm investors have the time to wait it out. Although, as a side note, if you were a buyandhold investor from the 1960searly 1980s, then buy and hold was not very good. Is it just the psychologicaladdictive aspect of it? This is the biggest reason. Day trading is stressful and stress can cause financially destructive decisions such as overleveraging, overtrading, etc. Why is day trading stressful? Because you are managing hundreds to thousands of trades a year. When combined with the lack of time in a day to make moves, it becomes stressful. Also, many day traders do it full time.

The ten thousand yen note, equivalent roughly to the 100 bill, is the main base of Japanese currency. If you go to the bank, for example, you will almost always take out your money in ten thousand yen notes. Knowing a little about the language, i would say it would become quite strange and unnatural to suddenly start using a hundred as the main note value.

    "body": "In general, if you can afford to replace something, you are able to \"selfinsure\". You really want to understand a little of the statistics before you can make a generic call, but my rule of thumb is that insurance via \"extended warranty\" is rarely a good deal. Here is a simple expected value math formula you can apply when the  is true, then you should buy it replacement cost x likelihood of using warranty   cost of insurance You can then backcompute, what is the likelihood that Id need to lose this item to break even? Given your numbers 2000 x Y  350 or Y  3502000 or Y  17.5 So if you think there is a 17.5 or greater chance that youll need to have you system replaced i.e. not just a simple fix AND as Scott pointed out youll be able to actually use the replacement warranty then the applecare is a good purchase. Note, this only applies to items you can replace outofpocket without significant burden, because if you didnt have the 10k to replace your car, it wouldnt matter if the insurance wasnt such a good deal especially if you need the car to get to work, etc. So the obvious question is \"Why would a forprofit company ever offer insurance on something they are statistically likely to lose money on?\" The obvious answer is \"they wouldnt,\" but that doesnt mean you should never buy this type of insurance, because you may have statistically significant circumstances. For instance, I purchased a 40 remote helicopter as a gift for my children. I also paid the 5 for a \"no questions asked\" warranty on it because, knowing my kids, I knew there was a nearly 100 chance they would break it at least once. In this case, this warranty was well worth the 5, because they did break it! Presumably they make money on these warranties because most of the purchasers of the plan are more attentive or too lazy to make the claim than in this case. Edit note I incorporated Scotts comment about likelihood of being able to utilize the warranty into a combined \"likelihood of using warranty\" term. This term could be broken up into likelihood of needing replacement x likelihood of actually getting company to replace it I didnt do this above because it makes it a little harder to understand, and may not be a major factor in all cases, but you can definitely add it after the fact i.e. if theres only a 90 chance Applecare will pay out at all, then divide the 17.5 by 0.9 to get 19.4 likelihood of needing the replacement for it to be cost effective. More complete formulas can be derived also including terms for full replacement costs vs repair costs and including terms for \"deductible\" type costs or shipping, but Im trying to keep things relatively simple for those who arent statistics nerds like I am."

In fact, incorporating in your situation will cost you in legal fees, administrative headaches, and a fair bit in taxes. The CRA would probably look at your corporation as a personal services corporation and it would not be allowed to claim a number of tax reductions.

Pay to get it looked at by a mechanic as a condition of sale. Use consumer reports to try and find a good model. Somebody in your position does not need a 15K car. You need a series of 2K or 4K cars that you will replace more often, but pay cash for. Car buying, especially from a dealer financed, place isnt how I would recommend building your credit back up. EDIT in response to your updates Build your credit the smart way, by not paying interest charges. Use your lower limit card, and annually apply for more credit, which you use and pay off each and every month. Borrowing is not going to help you. Just because you can afford to make payments, doesnt automatically make payments a wise decision. You have to examine the value of the loan, not what the payments are. Shop for a good price, shop for a good rate, then purchase. The amount you can pay every month should only be a factor than can kill the deal, not allow it. Pay cash for your vehicle until you can qualify for a low cost loan from a credit union or a bank. It is a waste of money and time to pay a penalty interest rate because you want to build your credit. Time is what will heal your credit score. If you really must borrow for the purchase, you must secure a loan prior to shopping for a car. Visit a few credit unions and get prequalified. Once you have a preapproved loan in place, you can let the deal try and beat your loan for a better deal. Dont make the mistake of letting the dealer do all the financing first."

    "header": "Should I open a credit card when I turn 18 just to start a credit score?",
    "body": "This is a good idea, but it will barely affect your credit score at all. Credit cards, while a good tool to use for giving a minor boost to your credit score and for purchasing things while also building up rewards with those purchases, arent very good for building credit. This is because when banks calculate your credit report, they look at your longterm credit history, and weigh larger, longerterm debt much higher than shortterm debt that you pay off right away. While having your credit card is better than nothing, its a relatively small drop in the pond when it comes to credit. I would still recommend getting a credit card though  it will, if you havent already started paying off a debt like a student or car loan, give you a credit identity and rewards depending on the credit card you choose. But if you do, do not ever let yourself fall into delinquency. Failing to pay off loans will damage your credit score. So if you do plan to get a credit card, it is much better to do as youve said and pay it all off as soon as possible. Edit In addition to the above, using a credit card has the added benefit of having greater security over Debit cards, and ensures that your own money wont be stolen though you will still have to report a fraudulent charge."

    "body": "All forms of liquid investing necessarily have the same expected value. If any one form were more profitable, money would flood in, equalizing it. Day trading is unusual in two key ways. First, although the expected value is the same, the risk profile is very different. For example, would you wager a dollar on the flip of a coin? You might. Why not, after all? Would you wager a million dollars? Probably not. The risk is too great. Similarly, day trading can easily lose you all of your investment, which is why you should be careful doing it. In his memoirs Liars Poker, Michael Lewis tells an anecdote about a rich bond trader who proposes a milliondollar, evenmoney bet with his rival, an amount both could just barely afford to lose. The rival, not wanting to play but not wanting to lose face by declining, accepted.. with the proviso that the stakes be raised to 10 million dollars! The trader backed down. Also, the efficient market only guarantees the price will be efficient. It says nothing about transaction costs. A busy daytrader can easily incur thousands in commission and other fees."

You might get filled at a lower price if an ask comes in matching your bid, however you might never get filled. In regards to market orders, with the 100101 being more liquid, if your market order is larger than the orders at 101, then the remainder of your order should still get filled at only a slightly higher price. In regards to market orders with the 9098, being less liquid, it is likely that only part of your order gets filled, and any remained either doesnt get filled or gets filled at a much higher price."

Unless you have lots of experience that can help you discern good stocks from bad, investing in mutual funds reduces the risk considerably. If you want to finetune the plan, you can weigh certain categories higher to change your riskreturn profile e.g. equity funds will have higher returns and risk than fixed income bond funds, so if you want to take a little more risk you can put more in equity funds and less in fixed income funds. Lastly, dont stress too much over the individual investments. The most important thing is that you get as much company match as you can. You cannot beat the 100 return that comes from a company match. The allocation is mostly insignificant compared to that. Plus you can probably change your allocation later easily and cheaply if you dont like it. Disclaimer these are general guidelines for 401k investing in general and not personal advice."

However, you seem to have constrained yourself to 100 investment. Combine that with the fact that you are considering only two assets and you can easily have a solution where only one asset is desired in the portfolio. The fact that you describe the US fund as \"dominating\" the forign fund indicates that this may be the case for you. Ordinarily diversification benefits the overall portfolio even if one asset \"dominates\" another but it may not in your special case. Notice that these funds are both already highly diversified, so all you are getting is crossborder diversification by getting more than one. That may be why you are getting the solution you are. Ive seen a lot of suggested allocations that have weights similar to what you are using. Finding an optimal portfolio given a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix is very easy, with some reliable results. Fancy models get pretty much the same kinds of answers as simple ones. However, getting a good covariance matrix is hard and getting a good expected return vector is all but impossible. Unfortunately portfolio results are very sensitive to these inputs. For that reason, most of us use portfolio theory to guide our intuition, but seldom do the math for our own portfolio. In any model you use, your weak link is the expected return and covariance. More sophisticated models dont usually help produce a more reasonable result. For that reason, your original strategy 8020 sounds pretty good to me. Not sure why you are not diversifying outside of equities, but I suppose you have your reasons."

That being said, I doubt it will be enough to get your foot in the door. This seems more like a prerequisite rather than a true qualification, so youll be competing with MBAsFinance students and other people who either have experience or training in the financial industry. Id recommend you look into the Chartered Financial Analyst CFA certification as that will provide you with a rigorous knowledge of financial theory as well as asset management, which seems more appropriate for what youd like to do.

    "body": "IANAL and nor am I an accountant, so I cant give a definitive answer as to legality, but AFAIK, what you propose is legal. But whats the benefit? Avoiding corporation tax? Its simplistic  and costly  to think in terms like that. You need to run the numbers for different scenarios, and make a plan. You can end up ahead of the game precisely by choosing to pay some corporate tax each year. Really! Read on. One of the many reasons that selfemployed Canadians sometimes opt for a corporate structure over being a sole proprietor is to be able to not pay themselves everything the company earns each year. This is especially important when a business has some really good years, and others, meh. Using the corporation to retain earnings can be more tax effective. Example Imagine your corporation earns, net of accounting  other nontax costs except for your draws, 120,000year for 5 years, and 0 in year 6. Assume the business is your only source of income for those 6 years. Would you rather Pay yourself the entire 120,000yr in years 15, then 0 in year 6 living off personal savings you hopefully accumulated earlier, subjecting the 120,000yr to personal income tax only, leaving nothing in the corporation to be taxed? Very roughly speaking, assuming tax rates  brackets are level from year to year, and using this calculator which simplifies certain things, then in Ontario, then youd net 84,878yr for years 15, and 0 in year 6. Overall, you realized 424,390. Drawing the income in this manner, the average tax rate on the 600,000 was 29.26. vs. Pay yourself only 100,000yr in years 15, leaving 20,000yr subject to corporation tax. Assuming a 15.5 combined federalprovincial corporate tax rate includes the small business deduction, then the corp. is left with 16,900yr to add to retained earnings in years 15. In year 6, the corp. has 84,500 in retained earnings to be distributed to you, the sole owner, as a dividend of the noneligible kind. Again, very roughly speaking, youd personally net 73,560yr in years 15, and then on the 84,500 dividend in year 6, youd net 73,658. Overall, you realized 441,458. Drawing the income in this manner, the average tax rate on the 600K was 26.42. i.e. Scenario 2, which spreads the income out over the six years, saved 2.84 in tax, or 14,400. Smoothing out your income is also a prudent thing to do. Would you rather find yourself in year 6, having no clients and no revenue, with nothing left to draw on? Or would you rather the company had saved money from the good years to pay you in the lean one?"

The first four digits of the credit card number often indicate the bank, although smaller banks may share. But for example a Capital One card would indicate the bank. Other sellers work through a payment gateway that collects the information. Even there, the seller may collect most of the information first and send it to the gateway. In particular, the seller may collect name, email, phone, and address information. And in general the gateway will reveal that kind of information. They will not give the seller credit card info other than the name on the card, expiration date, and possible last four digits. They may report if the address matches the cards billing address mismatched addresses may mean fraud. Buying through someone like PayPal can provide the least information. For a digital good, PayPal can only expose the buyers name which may be a business name and email associated with the payment account.

At any time T for each product on a typical exchange there are two welldefined prices At time T there is literally no person in the market who wants to sell below the ask, so all the people who are waiting to buy at the bid or below could very well be waiting there forever. Theres simply no guarantee that any seller will ever want to part with their product for a lesser price than they think its worth. So if you want to buy the product at time T you have a tough choice to make you get in line at the bid price, where theres no guarantee that your request will ever be filled, and you might never get your hands on the product you decide that owning the product right now is more valuable to you than ask  bid  quantity, so you tell the exchange that youre willing to buy at the ask price, and the exchange matches you with whichever seller is first in line Now, if youre in the market for the long term, the above choice is completely immaterial to you. Who cares if you pay 10.00  1000 shares or 10.01  1000 shares when you plan to sell 30 years from now at 200 or 200.01? But if youre a day trader or anyone else with a very short time horizon, then this choice is extremely important if the price is about to go up several cents and you got in line at the bid and never got filled then you missed out on some profit if you \"cross the spread\" to buy at the ask and then the price doesnt go up or worse, goes down, youre screwed. In order to get out of the position youll have to cross the spread again and sell at at most the bid, meaning youve now paid the spread twice plus transaction fees and regulatory fees for nothing. All of the above also applies in reverse for selling at the ask versus selling at the bid, but most people like to learn in terms of buying rather than selling."

This typically works only in smaller stores, where youre talking directly to the owners, but it is sometimes possible to negotiate a few percent off the price when paying by check, since otherwise theyd have to give a few percent to the credit card company.

Not worth worrying about on small items, but if youre making a large purchase a bedroom suite, for example it can pay for lunch. And sometimes the stores willing to give you more discount than that, simply because with checks they dont have to worry about chargebacks or some of the other weirdnesses that can occur in credit card processing. Another reason Nobodys very likely to steal you check number and try to write themselves a second check or otherwise use it without authorization. Its just too easy to steal credit card info these days to make printing checks worth the effort. But, in the end, the real answer is that theres no rational reason not to use checks.

Judging from the comments in the other answers, I think everyone is addressing your question, \"How can you possibly lose money,\" there are a lot of ways to possibly lose money in the stock market. Here are my thoughts. This is a chart of the SP 500 from about 1996 to about 2012. At the top from the first arrow the entire SP500 index fell about 45. From the top of the second arrow the entire SP500 index fell about 52. It is really easy to look at our sustained bull market and feel invincible. And while Ill concede that not every company in the index fell over these two periods, bear in mind that the SP500 index is a collection of the 500 largest companies in the United States, and the entire index lost half its value twice. As the companies contained in the index shrink in value, they were replaced by companies that are the new biggest 500 in the country, then those fell too, and so on and so forth until the entire index lost half. Value is a funny thing because it isnt necessarily tied to the performance of the business look at the current rosy valuations of all these nonearnings techcompanies. It could be that a company is still performing very well but there are just no buyers for the stock. So, how can you lose money in the stock market? Very easily. In A practical sense, its when you need the money and can no longer weather the storm. People who went out for retirement around 2000 couldnt sit around and wait until 2007 for their account values to be replenished. This is why you roll off your stock exposure as you age. As you get older you dont have time and if you stop having income you can find yourself selling your assets at the least opportune time."

So you are basically exchanging 30 of seven years rent, plus interest, for 20 of the gain in value over 7 years. Which might be zero. Or might be very little. Or a lot, in which case you are still better off. Obviously you need to set up a bullet proof contract. A lawyer will also tell you what to put into the contract in case the house burns down and cant be rebuilt, or you add an extension to the home which increases the value. And keep in mind that this is a good deal if the house doesnt increase in value, but if the house increases in value a lot, you benefit anyway. A paradoxical situation, where the worse the deal turns out to be after 7 years, the better the result for you. In addition, the relative carries the risk of nonpayment, which the bank obviously is not willing to do."

    "body": "A moving average will act as support or resistance to a stock only when the stock is trending. The way it acts as support for instance is similar to a trendline. Take the daily chart of CBA over the last 6 months The first chart shows CBA with an uptrend support line. The second chart shows CBA during the same period with 50 day EMA as a support. Both can be used as support for the uptrend. Generally you can used these types of support or resistance in a downtrend to determine when to buy a stock and when to sell a stock. If I was looking to buy CBA whilst it was uptrending, one strategy I could use was to wait until it hit or got very close to the support trendline and then buy as it rebounces back up. If I already held the stock I could use a break down below the uptrend support line as a stop to exit out of the stock."

    "body": "It depends on the definition of earnings. A company could have revenue that nets in excess of expenses, so from that perspective a good cash flow or EBITDA, but have debt servicing costs, taxes, depreciation, amortization, that alters that perspective. So if a company is carrying a large debt load, then the bondholders are in the position to capture any excess revenues through debt service payments and the company is in a negative equity positions no equity or dividends payable to shareholders and has not produced earnings. If a company has valuable preferred shares issued and outstanding, then depending on the earnings definition, there may be no earnings for the common stock until the preferences are satisfied by the returns. So while the venture itself revenues minus costs could be cash flow positive, this may not be sufficient to produce \"earnings\" for shareholders, whose claim on the company still entitles them to zero current liquidation value i.e. they get nothing if the company dissolves immediately  all value goes to bondholders or preferred. It could also be that taxes are eating into revenue, or the depreciation of key assets is greater than the excess of revenues over costs e.g. a bike rental company by the beach makes money on a weekly basis but is rusting out half its stock every 3 months and replacement costs will overwhelm the operating revenues."

If you did get assigned on your short option, then I think the T3 settlement rules would matter for you. Basically you have 3 days to deliver. Youll get a note from your broker demanding that you provide the stock and probably threatening to liquidate assets in your account to cover their costs if you dont comply. If you still have the longleg of the calendar spread then you can obtain the stock by exercising your long call, or, if you have sufficient funds available, you can just buy the stock and keep your long call. If youre planning to exercise the long call to cover the position, then you need to check with your broker to see how quickly the stock soobtained will get credited to your account since it also has some settlement timeline. Its possible that you may not be able to get the stock quickly enough, especially if you act on day 3. Note that this is why you must buy the call with the far date. It is your \"insurance\" against a big move against you and getting assigned on your short call at a price that you cannot cover. With the IRA, you have some additional concerns over regular cash account  Namely you cannot freely contribute new cash any time that you want. That means that you have to have some coherent strategy in place here that ensures you can cover your obligations no matter what scenario unfolds. Usually brokers put additional restrictions on trades within IRAs just for this reason. Finally, in the cash account and assuming that you are assigned on your short call, you could potentially could get hit with a good faith, cash liquidation, or free riding violation when your short call is assigned, depending on how you deliver the stock and other things that youre doing in the same account.

    "header": "How do share dilution scams make money?",
    "body": "For this to work, those who control the dilution must also control their salaries because the only way for them to be paid off when its the corporation itself selling is to gain access to the proceeds. When a corporation sells newly issued equity, the corporation itself owns the money. To at least have the appearance of propriety, the scammers must be paid those proceeds. Both actions imply that the board is captured by the scammers. There are many corporations that seem to do this even with persistently large market capitalizations. The key difference between this and pumpanddump is that its a fraudulent group of investors selling in this case instead of the corporation itself. A detailed simple example Corporations are mandated by law to be little oligarchies although, \"republic\" is now becoming more appropriate with all of the new shareholder rights. A corporation is controlled at root by the board of directors who are elected by the shareholders. The board has no direct operational control, as that is left to the \"king\", the CEO however, the board does control what everyone wants access to the money. Board members have all sorts of legal qualitative mandates on how to behave, and theyve functioned fairly decently efficiently over the long run, but there are definitely some bad apples. Boards are somewhat intransigent since its difficult to hold board elections, and usually only specific board members are put up for election by a shareholder vote, so a bad one has the potential to really get stuck in there. Once a bad one is in there, they dont care because they know it will be tough to get them out, so they run roughshod over the companys purse. Only the board can take action on major funding such as the CEOs operating budget, board compensation, financing, investment, etc, some with shareholder approval, some without. The corporation itself owns all of those assets, but the board controls them. In this example, they scheme with most likely the top executive, but a rubber stamp top executive could allow a lower rung to scheme with the board, but the board is always constant until the law is changed. Because theres no honor amongst thieves, the board votes which can require some combination of executive and shareholder approval are taken very close together sell shares, increase salaries to key executive schemers, increase board compensation. The trusting shareholders believe this is in the best interests of the company at large so go along. So the money flows from existing  new shareholders to the corporation now controlled by a malicious board and then finally to the necessary malicious executive and the vital malicious board."

Compare a companys yield to that of others in the same industry different industries have different \"standards\" for what is considered a high or low yield Dividends have to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is cash flow. Look at the companys financial statements. Do they have sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend? Have there been any recent changes in their cash flow situation? How are earnings holding up? Debt levels? Cash on hand? Sudden moves in stock price. A sudden drop in the stock price will cause the yield to rise. Sometimes this indicates a bargain, but if the drop is due to a real worry about the companys financial health see 2 its probably an indication that a dividend cut is coming.

    "header": "Why does the biotechnology industry have such a high PE ratio?",
    "body": "I want to elaborate on some of the general points made in the other answers, since there is a lot that is special or unique to the biotech industry. By definition, a high PE ratio for an industry can stem from 1 high pricesdemand for companies in the industry, andor 2 low earnings in the industry. On average, the biotech industry exhibits both high demand and therefore high prices and low earnings, hence its average PE ratio. My answer is somewhat USspecific mainly the parts about the FDA but the rest of the information is relevant elsewhere. The biotech industry is a highpriced industry because for several reasons, some investors consider it an industry with significant growth potential. Also, bringing a drug to market requires a great deal of investment over several years, at minimum. A new drug may turn out to be highly profitable in the future, but the earliest the company could begin earning this profit is after the drug nears completion of Phase III clinical trials and passes the FDA approval process. Young, smallcap biotech companies may therefore have low or negative earnings for extended periods because they face high RD costs throughout the lengthy process of bringing their first drug or later drugs to market. This process can be on the order of decades. These depressed earnings, along with high demand for the companies, either through early investors, mergers and acquisitions, etc. can lead to high PE ratios. I addressed in detail several of the reasons why biotech companies are in demand now in another answer, but I want to add some information about the role of venture capital in the biotech industry that doesnt necessarily fit into the other answer. Venture capital is most prevalent in tech industries because of their high upfront capital requirements, and its even more important for young biotech companies because they require sophisticated computing and laboratory equipment and highlytrained staff before they can even begin their research. These capital requirement are only expected to rise as subfields like genetic engineering become more widespread in the industry when half the staff of a young company have PhDs in bioinformatics and they need highend computing power to evaluate their models, you can see why the initial costs can be quite high. To put this in perspective, in 2010, \"venture capitalists invested approximately 22 billion into nearly 2,749 companies.\" That comes out to roughly 7.8M per company. The same year Ive lost the article that mentioned this, unfortunately, the average venture capital investment in the biotech industry was almost double that, at 15M. Since many years can elapse between initial investment in a biotech company and the earliest potential for earnings, these companies may require large amounts of early investment to get them through this period. Its also important to understand why the biotech industry, as a whole, may exhibit low earnings for a long period after the initial investment. Much of this has to do with the drug development process and the phases of clinical trials. The biotech industry isnt 100 dedicated to pharmaceutical development, but the overlap is so significant that the following information is more than applicable. Drug development usually goes through three phases Drug discovery  This is the first research stage, where companies look for new chemical compounds that might have pharmaceutical applications. Compounds that pass this stage are those that are found to be effective against some biological target, although their effects on humans may not be known. Preclinical testing  In this stage, the company tests the drug for toxicity to major organs and potential side effects on other parts of the body. Through laboratory and animal testing, the company determines that the drug, in certain doses, is likely safe for use in humans. Once a drug passes the tests in this stage, the company submits an Investigational New Drug IND application to the FDA. This application contains results from the animallaboratory tests, details of the manufacturing process, and detailed proposals for human clinical trials should the FDA approve the companys IND application. Clinical trials  If the FDA approves the IND application, the company moves forward with clinical trials in human, which are themselves divided into several stages. \"Postclinical phase\"  ongoing trials  This stage is sometimes considered Phase IV of the clinical trials stage. Once the drug has been approved by the FDA or other regulatory agency, the company can ramp up its marketing efforts to physicians and consumers. The company will likely continue conducting clinical trials, as well as monitoring data on the widespread use of the drug, to both watch for unforeseen side effects or opportunities for offlabel use. I included such detailed information on the drug development process because its vitally important to realize that each and every step in this process has a cost, both in time and money. Most biopharm companies wont begin to realize profits from a successful drug until near the end of Phase III clinical trials. The vast RD costs, in both time and money, required to bring an effective drug through all of these steps and into the marketplace can easily depress earnings for many years. Also, keep in mind that most of the compounds identified in the drug discovery stage wont become profitable pharmaceutical products. A company may identify 5,000 compounds that show promise in the drug discovery stage. On average, less than ten of these compounds will qualify for human tests. These ten drugs may start human trials, but only around 20 of them will actually pass Phase III clinical trials and be submitted for FDA approval. The preclinical testing stage alone takes an average of 10 years to complete for a single drug. All this time, the company isnt earning profit on that drug. The linked article also goes into detail about recruitment delays in human trials, scheduling problems, and attrition rates for each phase of the drug development process. All of these items add both temporal and financial costs to the process and have the potential to further depress earnings. And finally, a drug could be withdrawn from the market even after it passes the drug development process. When this occurs, however, its usually the fault of the company for poor trial design or suppression of data as in the case of Vioxx. I want to make one final point to keep in mind when looking at financial statistics like the PE ratio, as well as performance and risk metrics. Different biotech funds dont necessarily represent the industry in the same way, since not all of these funds invest in the same firms. For example, the manager of Fidelitys Select Biotechnology Portfolio FBIOX has stated that he prefers to weight his fund towards medium to large cap companies that already have established cash flows. Like all biopharm companies, these firms face the RD costs associated with the drug development process, but the cost to their bottom line isnt as steep because they already have existing cash flows to sustain their business and accumulated human capital that should ideally make the development process more efficient for newer drugs. You can also see differences in composition between funds with similar strategies. The ishares Nasdaq Biotech Index Fund IBB also contains medium to large cap companies, but the composition of its top 10 holdings is slightly different from that of FBIOX. These differences can affect any metric although some might not be present for FBIOX, since its a mutual fund as well as performance. For example, FBIOX includes Ironwood Pharmaceuticals IRWD in its top 10 holdings, while IBB doesnt. Although IBB does include IRWD because its a major NASDAQ biotech stock, the difference in holdings is important for an industry where investors perception of a stock can hinge on a single drug approval. This is a factor even for established companies. In general, I want to emphasize that a funds that invest more heavily in smallcap biotech stocks may exhibit higher PE ratios for the reasons stated above, and b even funds with similar mixes of stocks may have somewhat different performance because of the nature of risk in the biotech industry. There are also funds like Vanguards Healthcare ETF VHT that have significant exposure to the biotech industry, including smallcap firms, but also to major players in the pharmaceutical market like Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, etc. Since buyouts of smallcap companies by large players are a major factor in the biotech industry, these funds may exhibit different financial statistics because they reflect both the high priceslow earnings of young companies and the more standard pricesestablished earnings of larger companies. Dont interpret anything I stated above as investment advice I dont want anything I say to be construed as any form of investment recommendation, since Im not making one."

    "body": "PE is a useful tool for evaluating the price of a company, but only in comparison to companies in similar industries, especially for industries with welldefined cash flows. For example, if you compared Consolidated Edison NYSEED to Hawaiian Electric NYSEHE, youll notice that HE has a significantly higher PE. All things being equal, that means that HE may be overpriced in comparison to ED. As an investor, you need to investigate further to determine whether that is true. HE is unique in that it is a utility that also operates a bank, so you need to take that into account. You need to think about what your goal is when you say that you are a \"conservative\" investor and look at the big picture, not a magic number. If conservative to you means capital preservation, you need to ensure that you are in investments that are diversified and appropriate. Given the interest rate situation in 2011, that means your bonds holding need to be in shortduration, highquality securities. Equities should be weighted towards large cap, with smaller holdings of international or commodityassociated funds. Consider a targetdate or blended fund like one of the Vanguard \"Life Strategy\" funds."

    "header": "Low risk hybrid investment strategy",
    "body": "I think you may be confused on terminology here. Financial leverage is debt that you have taken on, in order to invest. It increases your returns, because it allows you to invest with more money than what you actually own. Example If a 1,000 mutual fund investment returns 60 [6], then you could also take on 1,000 of debt at 3 interest, and earn 120 from both mutual fund investments, paying 30 in interest, leaving you with a net 90 [9 of your initial 1,000]. However, if the mutual fund takes a nose dive, and loses money, you still need to pay the 30 interest. In this way, using financial leverage actually increases your risk. It may provide higher returns, but you have the risk of losing more than just your initial principle amount. In the example above, imagine if the mutual fund you owned collapsed, and was worth nothing. Now, you would have lost 1,000 from the money you invested in the first place, and you would also still owe 1,000 to the bank. The key take away is that no risk and high returns do not go together. Safe returns right now are hovering around 0 interest rates. If you ever feel you have concocted a mix of options that leaves you with no risk and high returns, check your math again. As an addendum, if instead what you plan on doing is investing, say, 90 of your money in safer moneymarket type funds, and 10 in the stock market, then this is a good way to reduce your risk. However, it also reduces your returns, as only a small portion of your portfolio will realize the typically higher gains of the stock market. Once again, being safer with your investments leads to less return. That is not necessarily a bad thing in fact investing some part of your portfolio in interestearning low risk investments is often advised. 99 is basically the same as 100, however, so you almost dont benefit at all by investing that 1 in the stock market."

    "body": "You have several questions in your post so Ill deal with them individually Is taking small sums from your IRA really that detrimental? I mean as far as tax is concerned? Percentage wise, you pay the tax on the amount plus a 10 penalty, plus the opportunity cost of the gains that the money would have gotten. At 6 growth annually, in 5 years thats more than a 34 loss. There are much cheaper ways to get funds than tapping your IRA. Isnt the 10 \"penalty\" really to cover SS and the medicare tax that you did not pay before putting money into your retirement? No  you still pay SS and medicare on your gross income  401k contributions just reduce how much you pay in income tax. The 10 penalty is to dissuade you from using retirement money before you retire. If I ... contributed that to my IRA before taxes including SS and medicare tax that money would gain 6 interest. Again, you would still pay SS and Medicare, and like you say theres no guarantee that youll earn 6 on your money. I dont think you can pay taxes up front when making an early withdrawal from an IRA can you? This one you got right. When you file your taxes, your IRA contributions for the year are totaled up and are deducted from your gross income for tax purposes. Theres no tax effect when you make the contribution. Would it not be better to contribute that 5500 to my IRA and if I didnt need it, great, let it grow but if I did need it toward the end of the year, do an early withdrawal? So what do you plan your tax withholdings against? Do you plan on keeping it there reducing your withholdings and pay a big tax bill plus possibly penalties if you \"need it\"? Or do you plan to take it out and have a big refund when you file your taxes? You might be better off saving that up in a savings account during the year, and if at the end of the year you didnt use it, then make an IRA contribution, which will lower the taxes you pay. Dont use your IRA as a \"hopeful\" savings account. So if I needed to withdrawal 5500 and I am in the 25 tax bracket, I would owe the government 1925 in taxes 10 penalty. So if I withdrew 7425 to cover the tax and penalty, I would then be taxed 2600 an additional 675. Sounds like a cat chasing its tail trying to cover the tax. Yes if you take a withdrawal to pay the taxes. If you pay the tax with nonretirement money then the cycle stops. how can I make a withdrawal from an IRA without having to pay tax on tax. Pay cash for the tax and penalty rather then taking another withdrawal to pay the tax. If you cant afford the tax and penalty in cash, then dont withdraw at all. based on this years W2 form, I had an accountant do my taxes and the 27K loan was added as earned income then in another block there was the 2700 amount for the penalty. So you paid 25 in income tax for the earned income and an additional 10 penalty. So in your case it was a 35 overall \"tax\" instead of the 40 rule of thumb since many people are in 28 and 35 tax brackets The bottom line is it sounds like you are completely unorganized and have absolutely no margin to cover any unexpected expenses. I would stop contributing to retirement today until you can get control of your spending, get on a budget, and stop trying to use your IRA as a piggy bank. If you dont plan on using the money for retirement then dont put it in an IRA. Stop borrowing from it and getting into further binds that force you to make bad financial decisions. You dont go into detail about any other aspects mortgage? car loans? consumer debt? to even begin to know where the real problem is. So you need to write everything down that you own and you owe, write out your monthly expenses and income, and figure out what you can cut if needed in order to build up some cash savings. Until then, youre driving across country in a car with no tires, worrying about which highway will give you the best gas mileage."

    "body": "Normally, you dont pay capital gains tax until you actually realize a capital gain. However, there are some exceptions. The exception that affected Eduardo Saverin is the expatriation tax, or exit tax. If you leave a country and are no longer a tax resident, your former country taxes you on your unrealized capital gains from the period that you were a tax resident of that country. There are several countries that have an expatriation tax, including the United States. Saverin left the U.S. before the Facebook IPO. Saverin was perhaps already planning on leaving the U.S. he is originally from Brazil and has investments in Asia, so leaving before the IPO limited the amount of capital gains tax he had to pay upon his exit. Source Wall Street Journal So How Much Did He Really Save? Another situation that might be considered an exception and affects a lot of us is capital gain distributions inside a mutual fund. When mutual fund managers sell investments inside the fund and realize gains, they have to distribute those gains among all the mutual fund investors. This often takes the form of additional shares of the mutual fund that you are given, and you have to pay capital gains tax on these distributions. As a result, you can invest in a mutual fund, leave your money there and not sell, but have to pay capital gains tax anyway. In fact, you could owe capital gains tax on the distributions even if the value of your mutual fund investment has gone down."

    "body": "Dividend yields can also reflect important information about the companys status. For example, a company that has never lowered or stopped paying dividends is a \"strong\" company because it has the cashearnings power to maintain its dividend regardless of the market. Ideally, a company should pay dividends for at least 10 years for an investor to consider the company as a \"consistent payer.\" Furthermore, when a company pays dividend, it generally means that it has more cash than it can profitably reinvest in the business, so companies that pay dividends tend to be older but more stable. An important exception is REITs and their ilk  to avoid taxation, these types of funds must distribute 90 of their earnings to their shareholders, so they pay very high dividends. Just look at stocks like NLY or CMO to get an idea. The issue here, however, is two fold So a high dividend can be great [if it has been paid consistently] or risky [if the company is new or has a short payment history], and dividends can also tell us about what the companys status is. Lastly, taxation on dividend income is higher than taxation on capital gains, but by reinvesting dividends you can avoid this tax and lower your potential capital gain amount, thus limiting taxes. httpwww.tweedy.comresourceslibrarydocspapershighdivresearch.pdf is an excellent paper on dividend yields and investing."

    "header": "Interest payments for leveraged positions",
    "body": "I think to some extent you may be confusing the terms margin and leverage. From Investopedia Two concepts that are important to traders are margin and leverage. Margin is a loan extended by your broker that allows you to leverage the funds and securities in your account to enter larger trades. In order to use margin, you must open and be approved for a margin account. The loan is collateralized by the securities and cash in your margin account. The borrowed money doesnt come free, however it has to be paid back with interest. If you are a day trader or scalper this may not be a concern but if you are a swing trader, you can expect to pay between 5 and 10 interest on the borrowed money, or margin. Going handinhand with margin is leverage you use margin to create leverage. Leverage is the increased buying power that is available to margin account holders. Essentially, leverage allows you to pay less than full price for a trade, giving you the ability to enter larger positions than would be possible with your account funds alone. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 21 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to hold a position that is twice the value of your trading account. If you had 25,000 in your trading account with 21 leverage, you would be able to purchase 50,000 worth of stock. Margin refers to essentially buying with borrowed money. This must be paid back, with interest. You also may have a \"margin call\" forcing you to liquidate assets if you go beyond your margin limits. Leverage can be achieved in a number of ways when investing, one of which is investing with a margin account."

My paternal grandfather was the recipient of a great deal of financial largess from his wealthy mother during her life, and it was fully understood by him, her, and his siblings, that in exchange he would not share in her estate when she passed.

    "body": "Many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents. If you have X income in State A where you claim nonresident status and Y income overall, then you owe State A a fraction XY of the income tax that would have been due on Y income had you been a resident of State A. In other words, compute the state income tax on Y as per State A rules, and send us XY of that amount. If you are a resident of State B, then State B will tax you on Y but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. Thus, you might be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how small X is. As a practical matter, many commercial realestate investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income usually interest income that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040, and the annual bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report but do not get to deduct on the Federal return. As a result, State A is unlikely to come after you for the tax on, say, 100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will recover from you. But, when the real estate is sold, there will hopefully be a big capital gain, most of which will be sheltered from Federal tax since the passive losses finally get to be deducted. At this point, State A is not only owed a lot of money it knows nothing of your passive losses etc but, after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year, it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well."

    "header": "How should I think about stock dividends?",
    "body": "Different stocks balance dividend versus growth differently. Some have relatively flat value but pay a strong dividend  utility stocks used to be examples of that model, and bonds are in some sense an extreme version of this. Some, especially startups, pay virtually no dividends and aim for growth in the value of the stock. And you can probably find a stock that hits any point between these. This is the \"growth versus income\" spectrum you may have heard mentioned. In the past, investors took more of their return on investment as dividends  conceptually, a share of the companys net profits for the year reflecting the shares status as partial ownership. If you wanted to do so, you could use the dividend to purchase more shares via a dividend reinvestment plan or not, but that was up to you. These days, with growth having been strongly hyped, many companies have shifted much more to the growth model and dividends are often relatively wimpy. Essentially, this assumes that everyone wants the money reinvested and will take their profit by having that increase the value of their shares. Of course thats partly because some percentage of stockholders have been demanding growth at all costs, not always realistically. To address your specific case No, you probably arent buying Microsoft because you like its dividend rate youre buying it in the hope it continues to grow in stock value. But the dividend is a bit of additional return on your investment. And with other companies the tradeoff will be different. Thats one of the things, along with how much you believe in the company, that would affect your decision when buying shares in specific companies. Personally I mostly ignore the whole issue, since Im in index funds rather than individual stocks. Picking the fund sets my overall preference in terms of growth versus income after that its their problem to maintain that balance."

Any reduction in freight charges that may result from a diversion is not subject to billing adjustment through the Clearing House. Any applicable surcharges noted by the rail carrier shall be considered as part of the freight rate and can be billed to the buyer through the CME Clearing House. If within two 2 Business Days of the receipt of the Notice of Intent the buyer has not designated a destination, or if during that time the buyer and seller fail to agree on a negotiated freight charge, the seller shall treat the destination as Chicago, Illinois.

To complete delivery, the seller must deposit with the Clearing House a Delivery Notice, a uniform straight bill of lading or a copy thereof and written information specifying grade, a tally of pieces of each length, board feet by sizes and total board feet. The foregoing documents must be received by the Clearing House postmarked within fourteen 14 Business Days of the date of receipt of shipping instructions. In addition, within one 1 Business Day after acceptance by the railroad, the Clearing House must receive information via a telephone call, facsimile or electronic transmission from the seller giving the car number, piece count by length, unit size, total board footage and date of acceptance.

    "body": "Ill echo many factors. Brand There are generally two levels of pricing \"major brand\" and \"discount brand\". You can generally expect the \"discount brand\" to cost about 510 cents less per gallon in the same neighborhood as \"major brand\" gas. This is for a number of subfactors chief among them is that not all gasolines are created equal. A lot of the major brands Shell, Texaco, Chevron, BP, Exxon have proprietary detergents and cleaning agents that the discount brands do not. Theyre also generally closer to the real octane rating of the gas, have less ethanol youll see the sign that says \"contains up to 10 ethanol\" the bargain brands are right up at that limit while the toptier brands keep it lower and have stricter requirements about storage tank maintenance. Anyone who tells you that all gas is the same, send em my way I tried to save a few bux buying the cheaper stuff and now my car needs an engine overhaul because of fouling causing premature wear. A couple of my coworkers got a fuel system overhaul free from the local supermarket because the storage tank wasnt properly purged, and they got water into their gas tanks. Market Price Yes, this is of course a factor. Generally, gas prices at the pump rise very quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up, then fall more slowly than the market price, because the margins on gas sales for a Cstore are very slim. When prices change, the Cstores lose either way when prices rise they have to pay more than they got from the last tankful to buy the next one, and when prices fall they dont recoup the cost of their current tank. By quickly increasing the price to match commodities market prices, then gradually lowering them over time even if the market collapses, they mitigate the losses both ways. Overhead A gas station right next to a highway probably had to pay more for that land, both to buylease it and in property taxes. Nicer newer, cleaner stations generally have to pay more to stay that way. The higher your operating costs, the more youll have to charge for your gas. You can usually do so because the nicer station will attract customers willing to pay a few cents more for the nicer facilities. Taxation Most States charge a tax on gasoline, in addition to a Federal tax on gas. That revenue either goes into the States general fund, or is earmarked for transportation costs like road maintenance. Californias gas prices are skyhigh across the state, because they have the highest gas tax. Im not sure Colorado, Wyoming and Montana have gas taxes at all. Proximity to other stations No matter what you have to pay for the land and facilities, if theres another station across the street, you have to be within a penny of their price or people will vote with their feet. While \"predatory pricing\" taking a loss on sales in one area, buffered by profits elsewhere, in order to drive out competition is technically illegal, you see it all the time in the Cstore industry and it is very difficult to prove. This is a primary cause of neighborhoodtoneighborhood changes a Cstore will look around the other stations on their street corner, and the ones down the road a block or two each direction, when determining what they can sell gas for that day. The guy five blocks down has a completely different pool of competing stations. Population Distribution With a lot of people in a particular area, theres a big \"pie\" of customer dollars for Cstores to compete for. This generally leads to increased prices because the stations dont have to be AS cutthroat regardless of how good your price is, you have only so many pumps, and at some point people will pay more to use the open pump than wait for the cheaper one. The reverse is true in rural areas with only two stations in an entire small town, those two stations will become extremely cutthroat. However, rural prices also vary more with only one station in easy walking distance from where you ran out of gas, they can charge you 6 to fill that gallon gas can if they want, and youll pay it because the next gas stations another 20 miles down the road and probably has even higher prices. This, along with overhead, is generally why the Rockies states have the lowest average prices lands cheap and people are scarce in Wyoming. But, the \"pricegouging\" can be seen in the rural Southwest, where theres a LOT of ground to cover between gas stations, and so the \"last chance gas\" along major highways just outside of town, each a nickel to a dime more than the previous station, is a common stereotype. Transportation costs Prices are higher on the East and West Coasts than in the Gulf States for a very simple reason the bulk of the U.S. refinery capacity is along the Gulf Coast between Galveston and the Florida border. The further you are from there, the more it costs to get the fuel from the refinery to the gas station, and that cost is reflected at the pump. In fact, the East Coast imports gasoline by tanker even though the United States is now a net exporter of gasoline, because its cheaper to buy it from foreign sources than it would be to watch it drip through the limited pipeline capacity that exists between the Gulf states and the Eastern Seaboard."

If youd like to be more cognizant of the market, Id just dive in and buy a few companies you like. Many people will say you shouldnt pick your own stocks, you should buy an index fund, or this ETF or this much bonds, etc. You already have retirement savings, capital allocation is important there. Youre talking about an account total around 10 of your annual salary, and assuming you have sufficient liquid emergency funds theres a lot of nonmonetary benefit to being more aware of the economy and the stock market. But if you find the house youre going to buy, you may have to liquidate this account at a time thats not ideal, possibly at a loss. If all youre after is a greater return on your savings than the paltry 0.05 or whatever the big deposit banks are paying, then a high yield savings account is the way Id go, or a CD ladder. Yes, the market generally goes up but it doesnt ALWAYS go up. Get your money somewhere that its inured and you can be certain how much youll have tomorrow. Assuming a gain, the gain youll see will PALE in comparison to the deposits youll make. Deposits grow accounts. Consider these scenarios if you allocate 1,000 per month to this account. 1 Assuming an investment return of 5 youre talking about 330 return in the first year not counting commissions or possible losses. 2 Assuming a high yield savings account at 1.25 youre talking about 80 in the first year. Also remember, both of these amounts would be taxable. Ill admit in the event of 5 return youll have about four times the gain but youre talking about a difference of 250 on 12,000. Over three to five years the most significant contributor to the account, by far, will be your deposits. Anyway, as Im sure you know this is not investment advice and you may lose money etc."

However, once you have consolidated your debt into the mortgage I would pay more than the minimum amount so that you dont take too long to pay it off.

    "header": "Can the Delta be used to calculate the option premium given a certain target?",
    "body": "In a simple world yes, but not in the real world. Option pricing isnt that simplistic in real life. Generally option pricing uses a Monte Carlo simulation of the Black Scholes formulabinomial and then plot them nomally to decide the optimum price of the option. Primarily multiple scenarios are generated and under that specific scenario the option is priced and then a price is derived for the option in real life, using the prices which were predicted in the scenarios. So you dont generate a single price for an option, because you have to look into the future to see how the price of the option would behave, under the real elements of the market. So what you price is an assumption that this is the most likely value under my scenarios, which I predicted into the future. Because of the market, if you price an option higherlower than another competitor you introduce an option for arbitrage by others. So you try to be as close to the real value of the option, which your competitor also does. The more closer your option value is to the real price the better it is for all. Did you try the book from Hull ? EDIT While pricing you generally take variables which would affect the price of your option. The more variables you takemore nearer you are to the real situation the more realistic your price will be and you would converge on the real price faster. So simple formula is an option, but the deviations maybe large from the real value. And you would end up loosing money, most of the time. So the complicated formula is there for getting a more accurate price, not to confuse people. You can use your formula, but there will be odds stacked against you to loose money, from the onset, because you didnt consider the variables which mightwould affect the price of your option."

Is it news? earnings? stock analysis and techniques? All of these things influence investors perception of how much a stock is worth. If AMZN makes a lot of money one quarter, then the price might go up. But maybe public perception of AMZN changes because of a large scandal. This could cause the share price to decline even with the favorable earnings report. Why do these good or bad news make people want to buysell a stock? People invest to make money. If it looks like a company is going to take a turn for the worst, people will sell. If it looks like the company has a bright, cashladen future in front of them, people will buy. News is one of the many factors people use to determine how well a company will do. Theoretically could a bunch of people short AMZN and drive down the price regardless of how well it is doing? Say investors wanted to boycott AMZN in order to drive down the cost and get some cheap shares. This is pretty silly, but say for the sake of the argument that everyone who owned AMZN decided to sell their shares and no other investor was willing to buy the shares for less than 0.01, then AMZN shares would be \"worth\" 0.01 in that aspect.

So it would cost you 258  3.3kyear.

    "body": "The Paragraph talks about dividends given by Mutual Funds.

Now if the Mutual Fund decides to pay out a dividend of  1 to all unit holder, then post the distribution of dividend, the value of the Fund would become to  11. Thus if you are say investing on 1April and know that dividends of 1 would be paid on 5April [the divided distribution date is published typically weeks in advance], if you are hoping to make 1 in 5 days, that is not going to happen. On 6April you would get 1, but the value of the fund would now be 11 from the earlier 12. This may not be wise as in some countries you would ending up paying tax on 1. Even in shares, the concept is similar, however the price may get corrected immediately and one may not actually see it going down by 1 due to market dynamics."

I dont know how exactly you spend your income, but from my experience, in expensive California, saving 20K a year from 70K income with 800mo rent is feasible. Having a loan on your credit report which is paid on time and in full will definitely help you rebuilding your credit. Your calculations re the costs of the loan are based on the assumption that youre going to keep the loan for the whole period. Dont do that. See 1  you can repay this loan much quicker than the 3 years it should originally have been. 6 months of the loan which is then paid off will do marvels to your credit report and credit score. Yes, it is going to cost you some, but in your particular case I would argue that its worth it. Youre an adult now, you need credit cards, youll need a mortgage at some point, you need to rent a place to live  all these require a good credit report. Just waiting, as MrChrister suggests, will help, but much much slower. Having said that, a seller that \"cannot discuss the terms over the phone\" is most likely a dishonest person.

However, small residential units typically are not owned by professional real estate investors as your experience confirms. This has a fairly natural cause. The size of the investment opportunity is insufficient to warrant the proper researchdue diligence to which a large investment firm would have to commit if it wanted to properly assess the potential of a property. For a small real estate fund managing, say, 50 MM, it would take 100 properties at a 500K valuation in order to fully invest the funds. This number grows quickly as we decrease the average valuation to reflect even smaller individual units. Analogously, it is unlikely that you will find large institutional investors buying stocks with market caps of 20 MM. They simply cannot invest a large enough portion of total AUM to make the diligence make economic sense. As such, institutional real estate money tends to find its way into large multifamily units that provide a more convenient purchase size for a fund."

When the check writers bank gets the transaction, they will also decide what to do. If they reject it, the first bank will reverse the transaction. You cant count on a 90 day, or 180 day limit most banks will ask you to put a stop payment on an old check that you dont want cashed. This is especially important step if you write a replacement check. Because there is no check number to put a stop payment on, in fact the temporary hold will fall off after a few days.

    "body": "I have heard that investing more money into an investment which has gone down is generally a bad idea. \"Throwing good money after bad\" so to speak. Is investing more money into a stock, you already have a stake in, which has gone up in price a good idea? Other things being equal, deciding whether to buy more stocks or shares in a company youre already invested in should be made in the same way you would evaluate any investment decision and  broadly speaking  should not be influenced by whether an existing holding has gone up or down in value. For instance, given the current price of the stock, prevailing market conditions, and knowledge about the company, if you think there is a reasonable chance that the price will rise in the timeperiod you are interested in, then you may want to buy more stock. If you think there is a reasonable chance the price will fall, then you probably wont want to buy more stock. Note it may be that the past performance of a company is factored into your decision to buy e.g was a recent downturn merely a \"blip\", and longterm prospects remain good or have recent steady rises exhausted the potential for growth for the time being. And while this past performance will have played a part in whether any existing holding went up or down in value, it should only be the past performance  not whether or not youve gained or lost money  that affects the new decision. For instance let us suppose for reasons that seemed valid at the time you bought your original holding at 10share, the price has dropped to 2share, but you now believe both prices wereare \"wrong\" and that the \"true price\" should be around 5share. If you feel there is a good chance of this being achieved then buying shares at 2, anticipating theyll rally to 5, may be sound. But you should be doing this because you think the price will rise to 5, and not because it will offset the loses in your original holding. You may also want to take stock and evaluate why you thought it a good idea to buy at 10... if you were overly optimistic then, you should probably be asking yourself whether your current decisions in this or any share are \"sound\". There is one area where an existing holding does come into play as both jamesqf and Victor rightly point out, keeping a \"balanced\" portfolio  without putting \"all your eggs in one basket\"  is generally sound advice. So when considering the purchase of additional stock in a company you are already invested in, remember to look at the combined total old and new when evaluating how the potential purchase will affect your overall portfolio."

    "body": "I think youre missing a couple of things. First  why do you think its a reverse mortgage? More likely than not its a regular mortgage  home equity loan. If so, if they expect the stock market to rise significantly more than the amount of interest they pay on the loan  then its a totally sensible course of action. Second  the purchase in cash only to take out a loan later can definitely be a sensible way to do things. For example, if the seller wants to close fast, or if there are competing offers where not having a contingency is the tipping point. Another reason might be purchasing in an entity name for example holding the title as an LLC, and in this case it is easier to get a loan if you already have the house, since the banks see the owners actual commitment and not just promises."

    "body": "States have made sales tax more confusing by expanding some categories and shrinking or eliminating other categories. In days of old there were taxes on items, and specific taxes on other small categories such as fuel and cigarets . In many states there were taxes implemented state wide, and in other cases they only applied to a specific city or region. As time went on taxes could be raised to bring in more money for the state or local government, but these tax increase were seen as unfair to the poor. So now the states are modifying and tweaking the tax rates. Some items are tax free, some have a low tax, and some are at the full tax rate. This can get confusing because the type of store can also play a factor. A bag a chips from a grocery store can be treated differently than a bag of chips from a hotdog stand. Some states have also added special taxes on snack foods. In general, purchases they want to encourage staples from the grocery store are tax free or low tax, items they dont want to encourage snacks are fully taxed. You can also be sure that they will treat luxury items as fully taxed. A new frontier of taxation are ones designed to tax people who dont live there. They have added taxes on restaurants and hotels. Since they are paid by tourists, the people most likely to pay them dont have a voice in setting the rate. States are now wanting to tax services as a way to make up shortfalls in taxing. Dont expect consistency from state to state, or year to year. Oh by the way that penny tax was for something that cost 17 cents or less, unless that item had a lower tax rate. The receipt should clearly identify the taxable items, and their tax level."

    "header": "Do Americans really use checks that often?",
    "body": "When you start at a new job here in the U.S., the default means of payment is usually a paper check. Most folks will quickly set up direct deposit so that their employer deposits their paycheck directly into their personal bank account  the incentive to do so is that you receive your funds faster than if you deposit a paper check. Even if you set up direct deposit on your first day on the job, you may still receive your first paycheck as a paper check simply because the wheels of payroll processing turn slowly at some large companies. A counter example is a selfemployed contractor  perhaps a carpenter or house painter. These folks are paid by their customers, homeowners and such. Many larger, well established contracters now accept credit card payments from customers, but smaller independents may be reluctant to set up a credit card merchant account to accept payment by card because of all the fees that are associated with accepting credit card payments. 3 transaction fees and monthly service fees can be scary to any businessman who already has very thin profit margins. In such cases, these contractors prefer to be paid by check or in cash for the simple reason that there are no fees deducted from cash payments. There are a few folks here who dont trust direct deposit, or more specifically, dont trust their employer to perform the deposit correctly and on time. Some feel uncomfortable giving their bank info to their employer, fearing someone at the company could steal money from their account. In my experience, the folks who prefer a paper paycheck are often the same folks who rush to the bank on payday to redeem their paychecks for cash. They may have a bank account helps with check cashing but they prefer to carry cash. I operate in a manner similar to you  I use a debit card or credit card I only have one of each for nearly all transactions in daily life, I use electronic payments through my bank to pay my regular bills and mortgage, and I receive my paycheck by direct deposit. There have been periods where I havent written or received paper checks for so long that I have to hunt for where I put my checkbook! Even though I use a debit card for most store purchases, the bank account behind that debit card is actually a checking account according to the bank. Again, the system defaults to paper checks and you have the option of going electronic as well. Before we judge anyone who doesnt use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash, consider that direct deposit is a luxury of stability. Steady job, home, etc. Direct deposit doesnt make sense for a contractor or day laborer who expect to work for a different person each day or week. I dont think this is all that unique to the US. There are people in every city and country who dont have longterm employment with a single employer and therefore prefer cash or paper check over electronic payments. Id be willing to bet that this applies to the majority of people on the planet, actually."

    "header": "Scam or Real A woman from Facebook apparently needs my bank account to send money",
    "body": "The answers here are all correct. This is 100 scam, beyond any reasonable doubt. Dont fall for it. However, I felt it valuable to explain what would happen were you to fall for this. Its not all that hard to understand, but it involves understanding some of the time delays that exist in modern banking today. The most important thing to understand is that depositing a check does not actually put dollars in your account, even though it appears to. A check is not legal tender for debts public and private. Its a piece of paper known as a \"bill of exchange.\" Its an authorization for a payee you, to request that their bank pay you the amount on the check. A transaction made with a check does not actually draw to a close until your bank and their bank communicate and cause the actual transfer of funds to take place. This process is called \"clearing\" the check. Despite living in the modern times, this process is slow. It can take 710 days to clear a check especially if it is an international bank. This is not good for the banking business. You can imagine how difficult it would be to tell a poor client, who is living paycheck to paycheck, that he cant have his pay until the check clears a week later. Banks have an interest in hiding this annoying feature of the modern banking system, so they do. When you deposit a check, the bank will typically advance you the money an interest free loan, in effect while the check \"floats\" i.e. until it clears. This creates the illusion that the money is actually in your account for most intents and purposes. presumably a bank would distinguish between the floating check and a cleared check if you tried to close out your account, but otherwise it looks and feels like the money is in your hands. Of course, if the check is dishonored because the payer had insufficient funds, or the account simply did not exist, your bank will not get the money. At this moment, they will cancel any advances you received and notify you that the check bounced. Again, this happens 710 days later. The general pattern of this scam is that they will pay you by a method which clears slowly, like a check. They will then ask you to withdraw the money using a faster clearing method like a wire transfer or withdrawing the cash. Typically they will be encouraging you to move quickly they are on a timetable... when their check bounces, the game is up! At this time, it will appear as though the account has a positive balance, but in fact it has a negative balance plus an advance on the check. This looks great until 710 days later, when the check bounces. At that time, the bank will cancel the advance, and reality will set in. You will now have an open bank account, legally opened by you in your own name, which is deeply in debt. Meanwhile, the scammer walks away with all the money that you sent them which cleared quickly. There are many variants which can hide the details. Some can play games with check kiting to try to make your first check clear then try to rope you in for a more painful hit. Some will change the instruments they use checks are the easy ones, so theyre simply most common. Dont try to think \"maybe this one is legit.\" These scammers literally make a living off of making shady transactions look legit. Things I would recommend looking out for"

    "body": "As Waldfee says, CFDs are a derivative of the underlying stock in this case. If you are from the USA then they are prohibited in the USA as has also been mentioned. They are not prohibited, however, in many other countries including Australia. We can buy or short sell on a limited number of securities CFDs on Australian securities, USA securities and securities from many other countries, on FX, and different commodities. The reason you are paying much less than the actial stock price is worth is because you are buying on margin. When you go long you pay interest on overnight positions, and when you go short you recieve interest on overnight positions that is if you hold the position open overnight. Most CFDs are over the counter, however in Australia dont know about other countries we also have exchange traded CFDs called ASX CFDs. I have tried both ASX CFDs and over the counter CFDs and prefer the over the counter CFDs because the broker provides a market which closely but not exactly follows the underlying prices. Wlth the exchange traded CFDs there was low liquidity due to being quite new so there was the potential to be gapped quite considerably. This might improve as the market grows. All in all, once you understand how they work and what is involved in trading them, they are much easier than options or futers. However, if you are going to trade anything first get yourself educated, have a trading plan and risk management strategy, and paper trade before putting real money on the table. And remember, if you are in the USA, you are actually prohibited from trading CFDs. Regarding the price of AAPL at 50, the price should be the same as that of the underlying stock, it is just that your initial outlay will be less than buying the stock directly because you are buying on margin. Your initial outlay may be as little as 5 or lower, depending on the underlying stock."

They then invest this in a lowcost index fund, earning say 6 per year on average over 10 years. The result Alternatively, they leave the 220,000 in but tell the manager to invest it in the same index fund now. They earn nothing because the managers rapacious fees eat up all the gains 41.5  6, not perfectly accurate due to compounding but close enough since 6 is only an estimate anyway. The result the same 220,000 they started with. This backoftheenvelope calculation suggests they will actually come out ahead by biting the bullet and taking the money out. However, I would definitely not advise them to take this major step just based on this simple calculation. Many other factors are relevant e.g., taxes when selling the existing investment to buy the index fund, how much of their savings was this 300,000. Also, I dont know anything about how investment works in Hong Kong, so there could be some wrinkles that modify or invalidate this simple calculation. But it is a starting point. Based on what you say here, Id say they should take the earliest opportunity to tell everyone they know never to work with this investment manager. I would go so far as to say they should look at his credentials e.g., see what kind of financial advisor certification he has, if any, look up the ethical standards of their issuers, and consider filing a complaint. This is not because of the performance of the investments  losing 25 of your money due to market swings is a risk you have to accept  but because of the exorbitant fees. Unless Hong Kong has got some crazy kind of investment management market, charging 1.5 quarterly is highway robbery charging a 25 for withdrawal is pillage. Personally, I would seriously consider withdrawing the money even if the managers investments had outperformed the market."

    "body": "I think, the top three answers by Joe, Anthony and Bigh are giving you all the detail that you need on a technical sense. Although I would like to add a simple picture that underlines, that you can not really compare day trading to longterm trading and that the addictive and psychologic aspect that you mentioned can not be taken out of consideration. The long term investor is like someone buying a house for investment. You carefully look at all offers on the market. You choose by many factors, price, location, quality, environment, neighborhood and extras. After a long research, you pick your favorites and give them a closer look until you finally choose the object of desire, which will pay off in 10 years and will be a wise investment in your future. Now this sounds like a careful but smart person, who knows what he wants and has enough patience to have his earnings in the future. The short term investor is like someone running into the casino for a game of blackjack, roulette or poker. He is a person that thinks he has found the one and only formula, the philosophers stone, the moneypress and is seeking immense profits in just one night. And if it does not work, he is sure, that this was just bad coincidence and that his \"formula\" is correct and will work the next night. This person is a pure gambler and running the risk of becoming addicted. He is seeking quick and massive profits and does not give up, even though he knows, that the chances of becoming a millionaire in a casino are quite unrealistic and not better than playing in a lottery. So if you are a gamer, and the profit is less important than the \"fun\", then short term is the thing for you. If you are not necessarily seeking tons of millions, but just want to keep your risk of loss to a minimum, then long term is your way to go. So it is a question of personality, expectations and priorities. The answer why losses are bigger on high frequency signals is answered elsewhere. But I am convinced in reality it is a question of what you want and therefore very subjective. I have worked for both. I have worked for a portfolio company that has gone through periods of ups and downs, but on the long term has made a very tempting profit, which made me regret, that I did not ask for shares instead of money as payment. These people are very calm and intelligent people. They spend all their time investigating and searching for interesting objects for their portfolio and replace losers with winners. They are working for your money and investors just relax and wait. This has a very serious taste to it and I for my part would always prefer this form of investment. I have worked for an investment broker selling futures. I programmed the account management for their customers and in all those years I have only seen one customer that made the million. But tons of customers that had made huge losses. And this company was very emotional, harsh, unpersonal  employees changing day by day, top sellers coming in corvettes. All the people working there where gamblers, just like their customers. Well, it ended one day, when the police came and confiscated all computers from them, because customers have complained about their huge losses. I am glad, that I worked as a remote developer for them and got paid in money and not in options. So both worlds are so different from each other. The chances for bigger profits are higher on day trading, but so are the chances for bigger losses  so it is pure gambling. If you like gambling, split your investment half in long term and other half in short term, that is fun and wise in one. But one thing is for sure in over ten years, I have seen many customers loosing loads of money in options in the future markets or currencies. But I have never seen anyone making a loss in long term portfolio investment. There have been hard years, where the value dropped almost 30, but that was caught up by the following years, so that the only risk was minimizing the profit."

    "body": "Even if the price of your home did match inflation or better  and thats a question Ill let the other answers address  I propose that owning a home, by itself, is not a sufficient hedge against inflation. Consider Inflation will inflate your living expenses. If youre lucky, theyll inflate at the average. If youre unlucky, a change in your spending patterns perhaps agerelated could result in your expenses rising faster than inflation. Look at the subindexes of the CPI. Without income also rising with inflation or better, how will you cope with rising living expenses? Each passing year, advancing living expenses risk eclipsing a static income. Your home is an illiquid asset. Generally speaking, it neither generates income for you, nor can you sell only a portion. At best, owning your principal residence helps you avoid a rent expense and inflation in rents  but rent is only one of many living expenses. Some consider a reversemortgage an option to tap home equity, but it has a high cost. In other words If you dont want to be forced to liquidate [sell] your home, youll also need to look at ways to ensure your income sources rise with inflation. i.e. look at your cash flow, not just your net worth. Hence investing in housing, as in your own principal residence, is not an adequate hedge against inflation. If you owned additional properties to generate rental income, and you retained pricing power so you could increase the rent charged at least in line with inflation, your situation would be somewhat improved  except you would, perhaps, be adopting another problem Too high a concentration in a single asset class. Consequently, I would look at ways other than housing to hedge against inflation. Consider other kinds of investments. \"Safe as houses\" may be a clich, but it is no guarantee."

Id get looking into that as soon as you can. Do student loans have to be paid monthly? Any loan is a specific agreement between a lender and a borrower, so any payment terms could apply, such as bimonthly or quarterly. But monthly seems like the most reasonable assumption. Generally, you should assume the least favorable reasonably likely terms for you, so that you are prepared for a worstcase scenario. Lets say monthly. Can I just, as I had hoped, borrow large sums of money and only start paying them after college? Yes. That is a fair summary of all a student loan is.

Unsubsidized loans may accrue interest from the start of the loan period. If you have the option, obviously try hard to get the subsidized loans as the interest can be significant. I made a point to only take subsidized loans. WARNING Student loans currently enjoy a nearly? unique status in America as being one of the only loan types that are not forgivable in bankruptcy. This means that if you leave college with 100,000 in debt that begins accruing interest, there is no way for you to get out of it short of fleeing the country or existence. And at that point the creditors may come after your mother for the balance. These loans can balloon into outrageous amounts due to compounding interest. Please have a healthy fear of student loans. For more on this, listen to this hour long radio program about this. Would a minimum wage job help, Of course it will \"help\" but will it \"help enough\"? That depends on how much you work. If you make 7.50hr and work 20 hrsweek for all but 3 weeks of the year, after taxes you will be adding about 6,000 to offset your costs. In 3 years of college see below, thats 18,000, which, depending on where you go, is not bad at helping defray costs. If you are at fulltime 40 hrs, then it is 12kyr or 36k toward defraying costs. These numbers are nothing to sniff at. Do you have any computerwebgraphics skills? Its possible you could find ways to make more than minimum wage if you learn some niche IT industry skill. If I could go back and redo those years I wouldnt have wasted much time delivering pizzas and would have learned HTML in the 90s and would have potentially made some significant money. would college and fulltime job be manageable together? Thats highly specific to each situation which job? how far a commute to it? which major? how efficient are you? how easily do you learn? but I would say that, for the most part, its not a good idea, not only for the academicachievement side of it, but the personalenrichment aspect of college. Clubs, sports, relationships, activities, dorm bull sessions, all that good stuff, they deserve their space and time and itd be a shame to miss out on that because youre on the 2nd shift at WalMart 40hrsweek. How do I find out what scholarships, grants, and financial aid I can apply for? Are you in a high school with a career or guidance counselor? If so, go to that person about this as a start. If not, there are tons of resources out there. Public libraries should have huge directories of scholarships. The Federal Student Loan program has a website. There are also a lot of resources online found by just searching Google for scholarshipsthough do be careful about any online sources including this advice!. Sermon Lastly, please carefully consider the overall cost vs. benefit to you. College in 2012 is anything but cheap. A typical price for a textbook is 150 or more. Tuition and board can range over 40k at private colleges. There is a recent growing call for Americans to rethink the automatic nature of going to college considering the enormous financial burden it puts many families under. Charles Murray, for one, has put out a book suggesting that far too many students go to college now, to societys and many individuals detriment hes a controversial thinker, but I think some of his points are valid and actually urgent. With all that said, consider ways to go to college but keep costs down. Public colleges in your state will almost always be significantly cheaper than private or outofstate. Once there, aim for As and Bsdont cheat yourself out of what you pay for. And lastly, consider a plan in which you complete college in three years, by attending summer courses. This website has a number of other options for helping to reduce the cost of college."

    "body": "Open an investment account on your own and have them roll the old 401K accounts into either a ROTH or traditional IRA. Do not leave them in old 401k accounts and definitely dont roll them into your new employers 401K. Why? Well, as great as 401K accounts are, there is one thing that employers rarely mention and the 401K companies actively try to hide Most 401K plans are loaded with HUGE fees. You wont see them on your statements, they are often hidden very cleverly with accounting tricks. For example, in several plans I have participated in, the mutual fund symbols may LOOK like the ones you see on the stock tickers, but if you read the fine print they only \"approximate\" the underlying mutual fund they are named for. That is, if you multiply the number of shares by the market price you will arrive at a number higher than the one printed on your statement. The \"spread\" between those numbers is the fee charged by the 401K management company, and since employees dont pick that company and cant easily fire them, they arent very competitive unless your company is really large and has a tough negotiator in HR. If you work for a small company, you are probably getting slammed by these fees. Also, they often charge fees for the \"automatic rebalancing\" service they offer to do annually to your account to keep your allocation in line with your current contribution allocations. I have no idea why it is legal for them not to disclose these fees on the statements, but they dont. I had to do some serious digging to find this out on my own and when I did it was downright scary. In one case they were siphoning off over 3 annually from the account using this standard practice. HOWEVER, that is not to say that you shouldnt participate in these plans, especially if there is an employer match. There are fees with any investment account and the \"free money\" your employer is kicking in almost always offsets these fees. My point here is just that you shouldnt keep the money in the 401K after you leave the company when you have an option to move it to an account with much cheaper fees."

In my opinion, and based on my experience, 10 annually is not an exageration. I start to ask questions only if one talks about return of 30 annually or more. These kind of returns are possible, but very rare. What sort of things do we need to look out for with alternative investment? First the quality of the website and the documentation provided. Then the resume of the founders. Who are those guys? I check their LinkedIn profile. If they have none, I am out. A LinkedIn profile is a minimum if you manage an investment company. I also look for diversification and this is the case with Yieldstreet. How do we assess the risks associated with alternative investments? I would never put more than 10 of my capital in any investment, alternative ones included. I also try to find financial information on the promoter itself. In Yieldstreet case check the legal advisor. I remember an international fraud case I analyse. The promoter I investigated had seven small trust involved in British Virgin Islands, in Panama, in Holland, in Portugal, in the United States and Canada plus a banking account in Switzerland and the biggest shareholding company in the Isle of Man. No need to talk about what happened after. The investors were all non residents in the juridictions involved and no legal recourse were possible. They lost everything. These promoters regularly change juridictions to avoid detection. As far as Yieldstreet is concerned, what I read and checked seems interesting. Thanks for your question. I will check it out myself more. I am also a very cautious investor. To evaluate alternative investments is difficult , but no need to be afraid or to avoid them.

    "body": "This is an excellent topic as it impacts so many in so many different ways. Here are some thoughts on how the accounts are used which is almost as important as the as calculating the income or tax. The Roth is the best bang for the buck, once you have taken full advantage of employer matched 401K. Yes, you pay taxes upfront. All income earned isnt taxed under current tax rules. This money can be passed on to family and can continue forever. Contributions can be funded past age 70.5. Once account is active for over 5 years, contributions can be withdrawn and used ie house down payment, college, medical bills, without any penalties. All income earned must be left in the account to avoid penalties. For younger workers, without an employer match this is idea given the income tax savings over the longer term and they are most likely in the lowest tax bracket. The 401k is great for retirement, which is made better if employer matches contributions. This is like getting paid for retirement saving. These funds are \"locked\" up until age 59.5, with exceptions. All contributed funds and all earnings are \"untaxed\" until withdrawn. The idea here is that at the time contributions are added, you are at a higher tax rate then when you expect to withdrawn funds. Trade Accounts, investments, as stated before are the used of taxed dollars. The biggest advantage of these are the liquidity."

You will have to buy back these shares from the lender at some point which is why the 10k isnt just \"free money.\" If the stock has gone up in price in the meantime you are going to be paying more than the 10k you got for the same amount of shares and vice versa."

It would be extremely unusual to be able to find a CD, bond or other lowrisk play at a better rate. Any investment in a risky asset such as stocks is just leveraging up your personal balance sheet, which is strictly a personal decision based on your risk appetite, but would nearly universally be regarded as a mistake by a financial advisor. The only exception I can think of here would be taking out a home mortgage, and even that would be debatable.

Paying off debt with a lower interest rate using debt with a higher interest rate is throwing a lot of money away and impoverishing yourself needlessly. Psychology cant get around that. If you want a psychological aid, decide how much you are going to pay toward these debts and have it automatically deducted from your paycheck so you never see it. Make the minimum payment on every debt you have except the one with the highest interest rate. Pay the very most you can toward that. Then when it is paid off, move to the next highest.

    "body": "What could a small guy with 100 do to make himself not poor? The first priority is an emergency fund. One of the largest expenses of poor people are shortterm loans for emergencies. Being able to avoid those will likely be more lucrative than an SP investment. Remember, just like a loan, if you use your emergency fund, youll need to refill it. Be smart, and pay yourself 10 interest when you do. Its still less than youd pay for a payday loan, and yet it means that after every emergency youre better prepared for the next event. To get an idea for how much youd need you probably own a car. How much would you spend, if you suddenly had to replace it? That should be money you have available. If you think \"must\" buy a new car, better have that much available. If you can live with a clunker, youre still going to need a few K. Having said that, the next goal after the emergency fund should be savings for the infrequent large purchases. The emergency fund if for the case where your car unexpectedly gets totaled the saving is for the regular replacement. Again, the point here is to avoid an expensive loan. Paying down a mortgage is not that important. Mortgage loans are cheaper than car loans, and much cheaper than payday loans. Still, it would be nice if your house is paid when you retire.

Keep in mind that with a business even as a sole trader any business expenses that contribute to the earning of your business income is deductible, reducing the final amount of tax youll have to pay. The ATO website has lots of good information and examples to look at including tax rates. If your total income is pushing into a higher tax bracket over 30c tax per 1 earned, it may be worth looking at shifting your business to operate under a company structure that just has a fixed tax rate around 30c per 1. That said, for me, I dont want the paperwork overhead of a company yet so Im running my side business as a sole trader too. Id rather do that and keep it easy for now while my business gets profitable that waste time on admin structures for tax reasons even if in the shortterm it may mean slightly higher tax.

Capital that the company has no use for does not make a significant positive return on investment, as you pointed out, yes the company could accrue interest, but that is not going to make the company large sums of cash. While the company may be great at making shoes  maybe even the best in the world  doesnt mean they are good investors. Sure they could dabble at using their capital to invest in other equities, but they dont, because they just want to focus on making shoes. If the dividend goes to the investors, they can do what they wish, be it reinvest in the company, or invest elsewhere. Other companies that may make good use of the capital, and create significant returns on it are one such example. That is the rational answer, beyond that, one of the main reasons is that people like the feeling of receiving dividends  it might not be the answer you are looking for, but many people prefer companies that pay dividends for no rational reason over companies which grow their asset value."

Put it in the housing way, if you paid off your home, would you pull out an equity loanline for a purchase when you have enough money in savings? I cant answer the question for you or anyone else, as you can probably find many people who will see benefits to either. I can tell you two observations Ive made about this question it comes a lot with housing over time. First, it tends to come up a lot when stocks are in a bubble to the point where people begin to consider borrowing from 0 interest rate credit cards to buy stocks or float bills for a while. How quickly people forget what it feels and looks like when you see your financial assets drop 5060! Its not Wall Street thats greedy, its most average investors. Second, people asking this question generally overlook the behavior behind the action as Carnegie said, \"Concentration is the key to wealth\" and concentrating your financial energy on something, instead of throwing it all over the place, can simplify your life. This is one reason why lottery winners dont keep their winnings their financial behavior was rotten before winning, and simply getting a lot of money seldom changes behavior. Even if you get paid a lot or little, thats irrelevant to success because success requires behavior and when you master the behavior everything else like money, happiness, peace of mind, etc follows."

All double entry book keeping operations consist of a debit, credit tuple performed on two different books ledgers. The actual arithmetic operation performed by a debit or a credit depends on the book keeping classification of the ledger it is performed on. Liability accounts behave the way you would expect  a debit is subtraction, and a credit is addition. Asset accounts are the other way around, a debit is an addition, and a credit is a subtraction. The confusion when dealing with banks, partly comes from this classification, since while your deposit account is your asset, it is the banks liability. So when you deposit 100 cash at the bank, it will perform the operation debit cash account an asset, credit deposit account. Each ledger account will have 100 added to it. Similarly when you withdraw cash, the operation is credit cash, debit deposit. However the operation that your accountant will perform on your own books, is the opposite, since the cash was your asset, and now the deposit account is.

    "body": "There are broadly two kinds of pension final salary  defined benefit, and money purchase. The text you quote above, where it talks about \"pension\" it is referring to a final salary  defined benefit scheme. In this type of scheme you earn a salary of X during your working life, and you are then entitled to a proportion of X the proportion depends on how long you worked there as a pension. These types of scheme are relatively rare now outside the public sector because the employer is liable for making enough investments into a pot to have enough money to pay everyones pension entitlements, and when the investments do poorly the liability for the shortfall ends up on the employers plate. You might have heard about the \"black hole in public sector pensions\" which is what this refers to  the investments that the government have made to pay public sector workers pensions has not in fact been sufficient. The other type of scheme is a money purchase scheme. In this scheme, you andor your employer make payments into an investment pot which is locked away until you retire. Once you retire, that pot is yours but there are restrictions on what you can do with it  you can use it to purchase an annuity I will give you my X,000 pension pot in return for you giving me an annual income of Y, say and you can take some of it as a lump sum. The onus is on you to make sure that you andor your employer have contributed enough to make a large enough pot to give you the income you want to live on, and to make a sensible decision about what to do with the pot when you retire and what to use it as income. With either type of scheme, you can claim this pension after you reach retirement age, whether or not you are still working. In some schemes you are also permitted to claim the pension earlier than retirement age if you have stopped working  it will depend on the rules of the scheme. What counts as \"retirement age\" depends on how old you are now and whether you are male or female as the government has been pushing this age out as people have been living longer. In addition to both schemes, there is also a \"state pension\" which is a fixed, nonmeanstested, weekly amount paid from government funds. Again you are entitled to receive this after you pass retirement age, whether or not you are still working."

By \"believe it is money\", I mean that they expect they will be able to turn it into useful goods or services food, rent, houses, truckloads full of iron ore, mining equipment, massages at the spa, helicopter rides, iPads, greenhouses, income streams to support your future retirement, etc. Foreign exchange rates change because peoples ideas about how much useful goods or services they can get with various currencies change. For example if the Zimbabwe government suddenly printed 10 times as much money as used to exist, you probably couldnt use that money to buy as much food at the ZimbabweMart, so you wouldnt be willing to give people as many USdollars which can buy food at the USMart for a Zimbabwedollar as you used to be able to. Its not exactly that easy, because  for instance  food in the US is more useful to me than food in Zimbabwe. But people still move around all sorts of things, like oil, or agricultural products, or minerals, or electronics components. The two main things that affect the value of a currency are the size of the economy that its tied to how much stuff there is to get, and how much of the currency there is  how fast its moving around the economy which tells you how much money there is to get it with. So most exchange rate shifts reflect a change in peoples expectations for a regional economy, or the size of a money supply. Also, Zimbabwe is doing much better now that its ditched their own currency  they kept printing trillions of dollars worth  and just trade in US dollars. Their economy still needs some work, but... better."

You can reasonably expect that in 2045 it will have retained its worth measured in \"houses\", against the other houses in the same neighbourhood. In money terms, it is likely to be worth more than its current value, if only because of inflation. To judge the real cost or benefit of the mortgage, you need to consider those factors. You didnt say whether the 3.625 is a fixed or variable rate, but you also need to consider how the rate might compare with inflation in the long term. If you have a fixed rate mortgage and inflation rises above 3.625 in future, you are making money from the loan in the long term, not losing what you pay in interest. On the other hand, your car is a wasting asset, and your car loans are just a way of \"paying by installments\" over the life of the car. If there are no penalties for early repayment, the obvious choice there is to pay off the highest interest rates first. You might also want to consider what happens if you need to \"get the 11,000 back\" to use for some other unplanned, or emergency purpose. If you pay it into your mortgage now, there is no easy way to get it back before 2045. On the other hand, if you pay down your car loans, most likely you now have a car that is worth more than the loans on it. In an emergency, you could sell the car and recover at least some of the 11,000. Of course you should keep enough cash available to cover \"normal emergencies\" without having to take this sort of action, but \"abnormal emergencies\" do sometimes happen!"

Some firms base the number of questions they ask you on sign up based not on what is needed to get a good profile, but on how many before people decide that it is too much hassle and bail. That usually results in poorer profiles. Also a live advisor may be better at really getting at your risk tolerance.

    "header": "How splits and dividends affect option prices",
    "body": "Investopedia explains how a stock split impacts the stocks options Each option contract is typically in control of 100 shares of an underlying security at a predetermined strike price. To find the new coverage of the option, take the split ratio and multiply by the old coverage normally 100 shares. To find the new strike price, take the old strike price and divide by the split ratio. Say, for example, you own a call for 100 shares of XYZ with a strike price of 75. Now, if XYZ had a stock split of 2 for 1, then the option would now be for 200 shares with a strike price of 37.50. If, on the other hand, the stock split was 3 for 2, then the option would be for 150 shares with a strike price of 50. So, yes, a 2 for 1 stock split would halve the option strike prices. Also, in case the Investopedia article isnt clear, after a split the options still control 100 shares per contract. Regarding how a dividend affects option prices, I found an article with a good explanation As mentioned above, dividends payment could reduce the price of a stock due to reduction of the companys assets. It becomes intuitive to know that if a stock is expected to go down, its call options will drop in extrinsic value while its put options will gain in extrinsic value before it happens. Indeed, dividends deflate the extrinsic value of call options and inflate the extrinsic value of put options weeks or even months before an expected dividend payment. Extrinsic value of Call Options are deflated due to dividends not only because of an expected reduction in the price of the stock but also due to the fact that call options buyers do not get paid the dividends that the stock buyers do. This makes call options of dividend paying stocks less attractive to own than the stocks itself, thereby depressing its extrinsic value. How much the value of call options drop due to dividends is really a function of its moneyness. In the money call options with high delta would be expected to drop the most on exdate while out of the money call options with lower delta would be least affected. If a stock is expected to drop by a certain amount, that drop would already have been priced into the extrinsic value of its put options way beforehand. This is what happens to put options of dividend paying stocks. This effect is again a function of options moneyness but this time, in the money put options raise in extrinsic value more than out of the money put options. This is because in the money put options with delta of close to 1 would gain almost dollar or dollar on the drop of a stock. As such, in the money put options would rise in extrinsic value almost as much as the dividend rate itself while out of the money put options may not experience any changes since the dividend effect may not be strong enough to bring the stock down to take those out of the money put options in the money. So, no, a dividend of 1 will not necessarily decrease an options price by 1 on the exdividend date. It depends on whether its a call or put option, and whether the option is \"in the money\" or \"out of the money\" and by how much."

    "header": "Does the stock market create any sort of value?",
    "body": "With regards to \"the stock market,\" there are actually two markets involved here PRIMARY MARKET Value is created in the primary market where capital is exchanged for a residual interest in an opportunity. As a theoretical example, if a person operating solo or with a small team were to discover or create a breakthrough product, such as an retroaging pill, that person likely wouldnt have the financial means to fully capitalize on his newfound idea. Others with more capital may also soon discover his idea or improve upon it and exploit it before he has a chance to. For a real life example, a person studying at a California university during the 1990s discovered a method to index internet webpages and was approached by some students after a talk on the subject. He returned to his native southern Europe country seeking funds to develop the webindexing business and failed to do so. Two of the students that approached him found capital readily available from investors in their campus sphere their business is today one of the biggest in the world. They had exchanged part of their residual interest for capital to develop their business. The primary market of the stock market works mostly same in creating value. It is also dependent upon the secondary market. SECONDARY MARKET The secondary market indicates the daytoday value of an enterprise. That market allows shareholders to manage their risk appetites and the enterprises operators to execute their shareholders interest for gains. In most cases, a secondary market reference will be used for pricing a primary market issuance. Without that reference, capital would be allocated less efficiently creating additional costs for all involved, issuers and investors. Consider what would happen if you sought to purchase a house and the mortgage lenders had no indication what the property was worth. This would make capital very expensive or possibly deny you access to credit. By having an indication, all involved are better off. That is value creating. There are some large developed economies equity markets, such as that in Germany, where many large enterprises stay privately held and credit financing, mostly from banks, is used. The approach has proven successful as well. So why do some nations financial markets still rely on capricious stock markets when private credit financing may do just fine in many cases? Its largely a matter of national culture. Countries such as the Netherlands, the UK and the US have long had active equity markets in continuous use that investors have trusted for centuries. CONCLUSION When leaders of an enterprise wish to grow the business to a large size with investment from the stock market, they arent limited by the size of their banks capital. Those leaders and their prospective investors will rely on the secondary market to determine values. In addition, if the leaders raise equity instead of debt capital, they are usually accorded more flexibility to take risks since shareholders usually have their own flexibility to transfer those risks to other investors if for any number of reasons they choose to do so. Stock markets create value in many other ways. The above are the main ways."

    "header": "Proscons of drawing income in retirement from soleowner corporation vs. soleproprietorship?",
    "body": "Not really, no. The assumption youre makingwithdrawals from a corporation are subject to \"[ordinary] income tax\"is simplistic. \"Income tax\" encompasses many taxes, some more benign than others, owing to credits and exemptions based on the kind of income. Moreover, the choices you listed as benefits in the soleproprietor casethe RRSP, the TFSA, and capital gains treatment for nonregistered investmentsall remain open to the owner of a small corporation ... the RRSP to the extent that the owner has received salary to create contribution room. A corporation can even, at some expense, establish a defined benefit DB pension plan and exceed individual RRSP contribution limits. Yes, there is a more taxefficient way for small business owners to benefit when it comes time to retirement. Here is an outline of two things Im aware of If your retirement withdrawals from your Canadian small business corporation would constitute withdrawal from the corporations retained earnings profits, i.e. income to the corporation that had already been subject to corporate income tax in prior years, then the corporation is able to declare such distributions as dividends and issue you a T5 slip Statement of Investment Income instead of a T4 slip Statement of Remuneration Paid. Dividends received by Canadian residents from Canadian corporations benefit from the Dividend Tax Credit DTC, which substantially increases the amount of income you can receive without incurring income tax. See TaxTips.ca  Noneligible small business dividend tax credit DTC. Quote For a single individual with no income other than taxable Canadian dividends which are eligible for the small business dividend tax credit, in 2014 approximately 35,551 [...] could be earned before any federal taxes were payable.  Provincial DTCs vary, and so combined federalprovincial maximums vary. See here. If youre wondering about \"noneligible\" vs. \"eligible\" private small business corporation dividends are generally considered noneligible for the best DTC benefitbut they get some benefitwhile a large public corporations dividends would generally be considered eligible. Eligiblenoneligible has to do with the corporations own income tax rates since Canadian small businesses already get a big tax break that large companies dont enjoy, the DTC for small businesses isnt as good as the DTC for public company dividends. Finally, even if there is hardly any sameyear income tax advantage in taking dividends over salary from an active small business corporation when you factor in both the income tax paid by the corporation and the individual, dividends still allow a business owner to smooth his income over time, which can result in a lower lifetime average tax rate. So you can use your business as a retained earnings piggy bank to spin off dividends that attract less tax than ordinary income. But! ... if you can convince somebody to buy your business from you, then you can benefit from the lifetime capital gains exemption of up to 800,000 on qualifying small business shares. i.e. you can receive up to 800K taxfree on the sale of your small business shares. This lifetime capital gains exemption is a big carrotdesigned, I believe, to incentivize Canadian entrepreneurs to develop goingconcern businesses that have value beyond their own time in the business. This means building things that would make your business worth buying, e.g. a valued brand or product, a customer base, intellectual property, etc. Of course, there are details and conditions with all of what I described, and I am not an accountant, so please consult a qualified, conflictfree professional if you need advice specific to your situation."

From what you say, it may be that you could increase your happiness simply by cutting back on these aggressive attempts to save a few bucks here and there. At the same time, if you do this, on some level your personality is probably not the type that would allow to simply \"forget it\". I think many frugal people are somewhat as you describe they dont like wasting money. In such cases, often what matters is not so much the actual saving money as the feeling of saving money. Therefore, Id suggest that you take a look at which of the \"moneylosing\" activities you mention are really worth it. The easiest ones to drop would be things like the homeimprovement project, which even you acknowledge does not save you money. If you like saving money, give yourself a pat on the back when you hire the contractor. If you want, run the numbers so you can \"prove\" to yourself how much money you are saving by not doing the work. For some of the other things, it may be that spending time to save a small amount can \"gamify\" an everyday experience and make it more interesting. For instance, comparing products to save a few bucks is not necessarily bad unless you actually dont like doing it. If spending a few hours comparing two toaster ovens on Amazon or whatever makes you feel good, go for it its no worse than spending a few hours watching TV. By acknowledging that you get something out of it  the feeling of getting a bargain  and savoring that, you can feel better about, and also potentially \"get it out of your system\" so that you wont feel the need to do it for every little thing. We all have our little pet obsessions, and its possible to acknowledge that theyre irrational, while still accepting them as part of your personality, and finding a way to satisfy them in a controlled manner that doesnt stress you out too much."

The reality of buying an used car is that you are buying someones else problems. How much do you know about that specific car model, its quirks, and what usually goes bad on them? For instance, it is a fact most people who buy a BMW 3 series flog them, so expect an used one to have been abused by someone trying to pick up girls by acting like he is a racer.

By taking this money and putting it away for her, you are taking her out of the decision making  unless you plan on giving her access to the account, letting her decide when to take it out. Still, you could talk her through what youre doing, and ask her how she feels about it. But perhaps she is too young to understand what committing the money away until 21 really means. And if, for example, she wants to buy a bike when she is 10, do you want her to see the fruits of her saved money? Finally, consider that if you or you  your daughter, depending on whether you want her to help in the decision decide to put the money in a financial institution in some manner, the risk you are taking on may need to be part of the lesson for her.

Usually, debt holders especially holders of senior debt are paid first, and youre entitled to whatever the bankruptcy proceedings decide to give holders of equity after the debt holders are paid off. More often than not, equity holders probably wont get much. To give an example, corporate bankruptcy usually involves one of two options liquidation or reorganization. In the US, these are called Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy, respectively. Canada and the United Kingdom also have similar procedures for corporations, although in the UK, reorganization is often referred to as administration. Many countries have similar procedures in place. Ill use the US as an example because its what Im most familiar with. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the company is liquidated to pay its debts. Investopedias article about bankruptcy states During Chapter 7 bankruptcy, investors are considered especially low on the ladder. Usually, the stock of a company undergoing Chapter 7 proceedings is usually worthless, and investors lose the money they invested. If you hold a bond, you might receive a fraction of its face value. What you receive depends on the amount of assets available for distribution and where your investment ranks on the priority list on the first page. In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company is turned over to a trustee that guides it through a reorganization. The Investopedia article quotes the SEC to describe what happens to stockholders when this happens \"During Chapter 11 bankruptcy, bondholders stop receiving interest and principal payments, and stockholders stop receiving dividends. If you are a bondholder, you may receive new stock in exchange for your bonds, new bonds or a combination of stock and bonds. If you are a stockholder, the trustee may ask you to send back your stock in exchange for shares in the reorganized company. The new shares may be fewer in number and worth less. The reorganization plan spells out your rights as an investor and what you can expect to receive, if anything, from the company.\" The exact details will depend on the reorganization plan thats worked out, local laws, court agreements, etc.. For example, in the case of General Motors bankruptcy, stockholders in the company before reorganization were left with worthless shares and were not granted shares in the new company."

You can invest a few hundred dollars at a time, and with good companies like Vanguard  T. Rowe Price there are no transaction fees, either for investing or for redeeming. 3 Longterm, its crashproof IF you have the selfdiscipline not to panicsell at market lows. In my case, my total fund valuation dropped around 40 in 08. I didnt sell anything and in fact tried to cut spending and invest more, and now I have nearly double what I had before the crash. Bottom line is that it has worked for me. After 30 years of investing this way without being fanatic about it, I have enough that I could live moderately without working for the rest of my life. Not  and this is where I part company with MMM and most of the FIRE community  that Id ever want to actually retire. But my modest financial independence gives me the freedom to work at things I like, rather than because Im worrying about paying bills."

    "body": "I dont believe there is any particular structural or financial reason that outgoing wire transfers cost so much in Canada, their costs are no higher than other countries and lower than many. Wires seem to be an area where the Canadian banks have decided people dont comparison shop, so its not a competitive advantage to offer a better price. The rates you quoted are on the low side 80 for a largish international wire is not unusual, and HSBC charges up to 150! There are several alternative ways to transfer money domestically in Canada. If the recipient banks at the same bank, its possible to go into a branch and transfer money directly from your own account to their account Ive never been charged for this. The transfer is immediate. But it couldnt be done online, last time I checked. For transfers where you dont know the recipients bank account, you can pay online with Interac ETransfers, offered by most Canadian banks. Its basically emailing money. It usually costs 1 to 1.50 per transfer, and has limits on how much you can send per dayweek. Each of the banks also have a billpay service, but unlike similar services in the US where they mail a paper check if the recipient isnt on their system, each Canadian bank has a limited number of possible payees mostly utilities, governments, major stores."

Im simplifying greatly here if more money is printed or the money supply increases through fractional reserve banking and it is chasing the same amount of goods then prices will go up. Conversely, if money is held constant and the economy becomes more productive, producing more goods, then a constant amount of money is chasing an increasing amount of goods and prices go down. After the Civil War the greenback went back to being on a gold standard in 1879. After 1879 greenbacks could be redeemed for gold. Gold restricts money growth since it is difficult to obtain. Here are the price and wage indexes from 1869  1889 from here Notice from 1879 to 1889 that wholesale and consumer prices fall but wages start to increase. Imagine your salary staying the same or even increasing but the prices of items falling. Still dont think inflation is a monetary phenomenon? Here is a CPI chart from 1800 to 2007 Notice how the curve starts to go drastically up around 1970. What happen then?

The method they are employing is commonly used by Finance Professors to teach their students how to find internal rate of return. The method is prone to lengthy trial and error attempts without having any way of knowing what rate to use as an initial guess to kick off the interest rate calculations So this is what I would suggest if you are not short on time and would like to get yourself familiar with numerical methods or iterative techniques to find internal rate of return There are way too many methods at disposal when it comes to finding interest rates some of which include All of the above methods use a seed value as a guess rate to start the iterative calculations and if results from successive calculations tend to converge within a certain absolute Error bound, we assume that one of the rates have been found as there may be as many rates as the order of the polynomial in this case 36 There are however some other methods that help find all rates by making use of Eigenvalues, but for this you would need a lengthy discourse of Linear Algebra One of the methods that I have come across which was published in the US in 1969 the year I was born   is called the Jenkins Traub method named after the two individuals who worked jointly on finding a solution to all roots of a polynomial discarding any previous work on the same subject I been trying to go over the Jenkins Traub algorithm but am having difficulty understanding the complex nature of the calculations required to find all roots of the polynomial In summary you would be better of reading up on this site about the Newton Raphson method to find IRR"

    "body": "Im no accountant, but I think the way Id want to approach this kind of thing in Gnucash would be to track it as an Asset, since it is. It sounds like your actual concern is that your tracked asset value isnt reflecting its current \"market\" value. Presumably because its risky its also illiquid, so youre not sure how much value it should have on your books. Your approach suggested here of having it as just as expense gives it a 0 value as an asset, but without tracking that theres something that you own. The two main approaches to tracking an investment in Gnucash are Of course, both of these approaches do assume that you have some notion of your investments \"current value\", which is what youre tracking. As the section on Estimating Valuation of the concepts guide says of valuing illiquid assets, \"There is no hard rule on this, and in fact different accountants may prefer to do this differently.\" If you really think that the investment isnt worth anything at the moment, then I suppose you should track it at 0, but presumably you think its worth something or you wouldnt have bought it, right? Even if its just for your personal records, part of a regular maybe annual? review of your investments should include coming up with what you currently value that investment at perhaps your best guess of what you could sell it for, assuming that you could find a willing buyer, and updating your records accordingly. Of course, if you need a valuation for a bank or for tax purposes or the like, they have more specific rules about how they are tracking what things are worth, but presumably youre trying to track your personal assets for your own reasons to get a handle on what you currently own. So, do that! Take the time to get a handle on the worth of what you currently own. And dont worry about getting the value wrong, just take your best guess, since you can always update it later when you learn new information about what your investment is worth."

    "body": "Just to be clear to start, beta is a statistical property. So if your beta is 0.8 over a period of time. Stock X moved on average 0.8 for a point move in the index. We might hope this property is persistent and it seems to be fairly persistent predictable but it doesnt have to be. Also it is important to note this is not a lag in time. Beta is a measure of the average size of a move in the stock at the same time as a move in the index. In your example both the stock and index are measured at end of day. You can say that the stock \"lags\" behind the index because it doesnt grow as quickly as the market when the market is growing, but this is not a lag in time just a lag in magnitude. People do occasionally calculate betas between a stock and lagged in time market prices, but this is not the commonly used meaning of beta. This might actually be a more useful measure as then you could bet on the future of the stock given what happened today in the market, but these \"betas\" tend to be much more unstable than the synchronized version and hard to trade on. When you calculated beta you choose a time scale, in this case daily. So if your calculation is on a daytoday basis then you have only tested the relationship on a daytoday basis not, for instance, on a weektoweek basis. Now daytoday and weektoweek betas are often related and are generally reasonably close but they do not have to be. There can be longer term effects only picked up on the longer scale. Stock X could daytoday with a average beta of 1 to the stock market, but could have even a negative beta yeartoyear with the market if the stock is countercyclical to longer scale trends on the market. So beta can change with the time scale used in the calculation."

    "body": "One idea If you came up with a model to calculate a \"fair price range\" for a stock, then any time the market price were to go below the range it could be a buy signal, and above the range it could be a sell signal. There are many ways to do stock valuation using fundamental analysis tools and ratios dividend discount model, PEG, etc. See Wikipedia  Stock valuation. And while many of the inputs to such a \"fair price range\" calculation might only change once per quarter, market prices and peersector statistics move more frequently or at different times and could generate signals to buysell the stock even if its own inputs to the calculation remain static over the period. For multinationals that have a lot of assets and income denominated in other currencies, foreign exchange rates provide another set of interesting inputs. I also think its important to recognize that with fundamental analysis, there will be extended periods when there are no buy signals for a stock, because the stocks of many popular, profitable companies never go \"on sale\", except perhaps during a panic. Moreover, during a bull market and especially during a bubble, there may be very few stocks worth buying. Fundamental analysis is designed to prevent one from overpaying for a stock, so even if there is interesting volume and price movement for the stock, there should still be no signal if that action happens well beyond the stocks fair price. Otherwise, it isnt fundamental analysis  its technical analysis. Whereas technical analysis can, by definition, generate far more signals because it largely ignores the fundamentals, which can make even an overvalued stocks movement interesting enough to generate signals."

    "header": "Why does it seem unnecessary to fully save for irregular periodic expenses?",
    "body": "I think wed need to look at actual numbers to see where youre running into trouble. Im also a little confused by your use of the term \"unexpected expenses\". You seem to be using that to describe expenses that are quite regular, that occur every X months, and so are totally expected. But assuming this is just some clumsy wording ... Heres the thing Start out by taking the amount of each expense, divided by the number of months between occurrences. This is the monthly cost of each expense. Add all these up. This is the amount that you should be setting aside every month for these expenses, once you get a \"base amount\" set up. So to take a simple example Say you have to pay property taxes of 1200 twice a year. So thats 1200 every 6 months  200 per month. Also say you have to pay a water bill once every 3 months thats typically 90. So 90 divided by 3  30. Assuming that was it, in the long term youd need to put aside 230 per month to stay even. I say \"in the long term\" because when youre just starting, you need to put aside an amount sufficient that your balance wont fall below zero. The easiest way to do this is to just set up a chart where you start from zero and add in this example 230 each month, and then subtract the amount of the bills when they will hit. Do this for some reasonable time in the future, say one year. Find the biggest negative balance. If you can add this amount to get started, youll be safe. If not, add this amount divided by the number of months from now until it occurs and make that a temporary addition to your deposits. Check if you now are safely always positive. If not, repeat the process for the next biggest negative. For example, lets say the property tax bills are April and October and the water bills are February, May, August, and November. Then your chart would look like this The biggest negative is 370 in April. So you have to add 370 in the first 4 months, or 92.50 per month. Lets say 93. That would give Now you stay at least barely above water for the whole year. You could extend the chart our further, but odds are the exact numbers will change next year and youll have to recalculate anyway. The more irregular the expenses, the more you will build up just before the big expense hits. But thats the whole point of saving for these, right? If a 1200 bill is coming next week and you dont have close to 1200 saved up in the account, where is the money coming from? If you have enough spare cash that you can just take the 1200 out of what you would have spent on lunch tomorrow, then you dont need this sort of account."

    "body": "Assuming this to be in the UK, and I suspect the rules are similar elsewhere, this indeed may be true. There is a threshold beneath which a business does not have to register for VAT  currently a turnover of 81,000. A non VAT registered business does not charge VAT but also cannot reclaim the VAT on their business expenses. For some businesses below the threshold it is worthwhile registering because the amount they can reclaim is significant. However, there are also many small businesses that do a lot of cash only jobs so as to not put the money through the books and therefore avoid any tax liability. There are also many who will get the the customer to buy materials direct to avoid including these in their turnover. Like every type of tax rule there is a grey area between people trying to avoid paying more tax than is needed and dodgy deals to avoid paying their fair share of tax."

    "body": "I have received a response from SIPC, confirming littleadvs answer For a brief background, the protections available under the Securities Investor Protection Act \"SIPA\", are only available in the context of a liquidation proceeding of a SIPC member brokerdealer and relate to the \"custody\" of securities and related cash at the SIPC member brokerdealer. Thus, if a SIPC member brokerdealer were to fail at a time when a customer had securities andor cash in the custody of the SIPC member brokerdealer, in most instances it would be SIPCs obligation to restore those securities and cash to the customer, within statutory limits. That does not mean, however, that the customer would necessarily receive the original value of his or her purchase. Rather, the customer receives the security itself andor the value of the customers account as of the day that the liquidation commenced. SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of any security. In a liquidation proceeding under the SIPA, SIPC may advance up to 500,000 per customer including a 250,000 limit on cash in the account. Please note that this protection only applies to the extent that you entrust cash or securities to a U.S. SIPC member. Foreign broker dealer subsidiaries are not SIPC members. However, to the extent that any assets, including foreign securities, are being held by the U.S. broker dealer, the assets are protected by SIPC. Stocks listed on the LSE are protected by SIPC to the extent they are held with a SIPC member broker dealer, up to the statutory limit of 500,000 per customer. As I mentioned in the comments, in the case of IB, indeed they have a foreign subsidiary, which is why SIPC does not cover it rather they are insured by Lloyds of London for such cases."

Im just a few chapters shy of being able to write a book about the incorrect advice Id heard bank people give their customers.

    "body": "Why would it not make more sense to invest in a handful of these heavyweights instead of also having to carry the weight of the other 450 some of which are mostly just baggage? First, a capweighted index fund will invest more heavily in larger cap companies, so the baggage you speak of does take up a smaller percentage of the portfolios value not that cap always equates to better performance. There are also equalweighted index funds where each company in the index is given equal weight in the portfolio. If you could accurately pick winners and losers, then of course you could beat index funds, but on average theyve performed well enough that theres little incentive for the average investor to look elsewhere. A handful of stocks opens you up to more risk, an Enron in your handful would be pretty devastating if it comprised a large percentage of your portfolio. Additionally, since you pay a fee on each transaction 5 in your example, you have to outperform a lowfee index fund significantly, or be investing a very large amount of money to come out ahead. You get diversification and lowfees with an index fund."

    "body": "Square charges a 2.75 fee which the merchant pays, so you would be losing money if you only got a 1.5 cashback bonus. I would guess that the real reason Square prohibits you from getting cash is because of VisaMC, state and federal regulations. VisaMC probably prohibit it for regular merchants due primarily to laws that are designed to prevent moneylaundering. Certain merchants like casinos are allowed to give you cash advances against a credit card, but regular merchants are not allowed to do this. It is much more difficult to get VisaMC to approve merchants to handle cash advances and they are subject to many additional regulations. Services like Western Union will let you send cash with a regular credit card, but they are classified as \"money transmitters\" and must comply with additional state and federal regulations. If Square were to allow cash advances, this would likely subject them to a bunch of additional regulations. It would cost them more to comply with these regulations and is outside their business model, so they simply prohibit it."

For example, Amazon requires a credit card for Prime membership, and car rental companies usually require a credit card. The following does not apply to the OP and is provided for reference. Debit cards dont build credit, so if youve never had a credit card or loan before, youll likely have no credit history at all if youve never had a credit card.

Anyone who buys a house with a downpayment of under 20 is required to pay for this insurance which protects the lender in case you default on your loan. PMI is what enables people to buy homes with as little as 35 down. I would recommend against paying more than 20, because having liquidity for emergency funds, or other investments will give you the sort of flexibility thats good to have when the economy isnt so great. Depending on whether the house you purchase is movein ready or a fixerupper, having funds set aside for repairs is a good idea as well."

    "body": "Before doing anything else you want a lawyer involved right from the beginning, to make sure that something reasonable happens with the house if one of you dies or leaves. Seriously, youll both be safer and happier if its all explicit. How much you should put on the house is not the right question. Houses dont sell instantly, and while you can access some of their stored value by borrowing against them that too can take some time to arrange. You need to have enough operating capital for normal finances, plus an emergency reserve to cover unexpectedly being out of work or sudden medical expenses. There are suggestions for how much that should be in answers to other questions. After that, the question is whether you should really be buying a house at all. It isnt always a better option than renting and again as discussed in answers to other questions there are ongoing costs in time and upkeep and taxes and insurance. If youre just thinking about the financials, it may be better to continue to rent and to invest the savings in the market. The time to buy a house is when you have the money and a reliable income, plan not to move for at least five years, really want the advantages of more elbow room and the freedom to alter the place to suit your needs which will absorb more money... As far as how much to put down vs. finance you really want a down payment of at least 20. Anything less than that, and the bank will insist you pay for mortgage insurance, which is a significant expense. Whether you want to pay more than that out of your savings depends on how low an interest rate you can get this is a good time in that regard versus how much return you are getting on your investments, combined with how long you want the mortgage to run and how large a mortgage payment youre comfortable committing to. If youve got a good investment plan in progress and can get a mortgage which charges a lower interest rate than your investments can reasonably be expected to pay you, putting less down and taking a larger mortgage is one of the safer forms of leveraged investing... IF youre comfortable with that. If the larger mortgage hanging over you is going to make you uncomfortable, this might not be a good answer for you. Its a judgement call. I waited until id been in out of school about 25 years before I was ready to buy a house. Since id been careful with my money over that time, I had enough in investments that I could have bought the house for cash. Or I could have gone the other way and financed 80 of it for maximum leverage. I decided that what I was comfortable with was financing 50. Youll have to work thru the numbers and decide what you are comfortable with. But I say again, if buying shared property you need a lawyer involved. It may be absolutely the right thing to do ... but you want to make sure everything is fully spelled out... and youll also want appropriate terms written into your wills. Being married would carry some automatic assumptions about joint ownership and survivor rights... but even then its safer to make it all explicit. Edit Yes, making a larger down payment may let you negotiate a lower interest rate on the loan. Youll have to find out what each bank is willing to offer you, or work with a mortgage broker who can explore those options for you."

Ive read that on average, about 12 is what you can get as a cash discount on a home purchase, all else being equal, but no hard data to back that. In certain situations it makes sense for a cash discount to be much greater than that, for instance, if the seller is in a hurry to close and your cash offer has no inspection clause. Similarly, if a house has been relisted after a sale fell through you might get a greater cashdiscount, or if an owner just overvalues the advantages of a cashoffer. Anecdotally, I had a neighbor take a cash offer 5 below asking and they had multiple offers at asking, they took the cash offer so they could close faster 15 days. Also, Ive lost out to a cash offer, also at 5 below asking, and they also had a shortclosing period and noinspection, my offer was over asking on that one, so total cash discount  5. There can be more volatility in the luxury home market, but I wouldnt guess that changes the cash vs financed evaluation much.

If theres still a market for your shares and you can sell them, you may want to just accept the loss and get out with what you can. However, shares of bankrupt companies are often delisted once bankrupt, since the company no longer meets minimum exchange listing requirements. If youre stuck holding shares with no market, you could lose everything  but thats not always the case Chapter 11 isnt total and final bankruptcy where the company ceases to exist after liquidation of its assets to pay off its debts. Rather, Chapter 11 is a section of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that permits a company to attempt to reorganize or renegotiate its debt obligations. During Chapter 11 reorganization, a company can negotiate with its creditors for a better arrangement. They typically need to demonstrate to creditors that without the burden of the heavy debt, they could achieve profitability. Such reorganization often involves creditors taking complete or majority ownership of the company when it emerges from Chapter 11 through a debtforequity swap. Thats why you, as an investor before the bankruptcy, are very likely to get nothing or just pennies on the dollar. Any equity you may be left holding will be considerably diluted in value. Its rare that shareholders before a Chapter 11 bankruptcy still retain any equity after the company emerges from Chapter 11, but it is possible. But it varies from bankruptcy to bankruptcy and it can be complex as montyloree pointed out. Investopedia has a great article An Overview of Corporate Bankruptcy. Heres an excerpt If a company youve got a stake in files for bankruptcy, chances are youll get back pennies to the dollar. Different bankruptcy proceedings or filings generally give some idea as to whether the average investor will get back all or a portion of his investment, but even that is determined on a casebycase basis. There is also a pecking order of creditors and investors of who get paid back first, second and last. In this article, well explain what happens when a public company files for protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws and how it affects investors. [...] How It Affects Investors [...] When your company goes bankrupt, there is a very good chance you will not get back the full value of your investment.

Part is avoiding tough news, part is laziness. There are tools that can help you be better with your money. In the past, I used YNAB You Need a Budget. Im not affiliated, and Im not saying this product is better than others for OP. Whether you use their software or not, their strategy works if you stick with it. Each time you get paid, allocate every dollar to categories where your budget tells you they need to be, prioritizing expenses, then bills, then debt reduction, then wealth building. As you spend money, mark it against those categories. Reconcile them as you spend the money. If you go over in one category eating out for example, you have to take from another entertainment. Theres no penalties for going over, but you have to take from another category to cover it. So the trick to all of it is being honest with yourself, sticking to it, recording all expenditures, and keeping priorities straight. I used it for three months. Like many others, I saved enough the first month to pay the cost of the software. I dont remember why I stopped using it, but I wish I had not. I will start again soon."

    "body": "As I understand it, if the \"borrower\" puts a down payment of 20 and the bank puts down 80, then the bank and the \"borrower\" own the home jointly as tenants in common with a 2080 split of the asset amongst them. The \"borrower\" moves into the home and pays the bank 80 of the fair rental value of the home each month. Material addedchanged in edit For the purposes of illustration, suppose that the \"borrower\" and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0.5 of the purchase cost. The \"borrower\" pays 80 of that amount i.e. 0.4 of the purchase cost to the bank on a monthly basis. The \"borrower\" is not required to do so but may choose to pay more money than this 0.4 of the purchase cost each month, or pay some amount in a lump sum. If he does so, he will own a larger percentage of the house, and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreedupon fair rental per month. So there is an incentive to pay off the bank. If and when the house is sold, the sale price is divided between \"borrower\" and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale. So the bank gets to share in the profits, if any. On the other hand, if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price, then the bank also suffers in the loss. It is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the homeowner gets whatever is left, or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the \"borrower\". I have no idea how other costs of home ownership property taxes, insurance, repair and maintenance or improvements, additions, etc are handled. Ditto what happens on Schedule A if such a \"loan\" is made to a US taxpayer."

If you want you can mention the employee by name if you know who they are. Ultimately, you can change banks. From what you say it sounds like you are dissatisfied with this bank, so I think you should at least begin evaluating other banks and consider switching. You can also let your current bank know you are planning to take all your money away from them specifically because of their poor customer service. You could consider filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleging that the bank engaged in some kind of deceptive marketing of their financial products. Of course you can also file a complaint with something like the Better Business Bureau, or even just write a negative Yelp review. But these actions wont really result in any penalty for the bank as a result of what they did in your specific case they just express your dissatisfaction in a way that will be recorded and possibly made public e.g., in a list of complaints to protect future consumers. If youre really gungho and have time and money to burn, you could hire a lawyer and get legal advice about whether it is possible to sue the bank for fraud or misuse of your personal information.

This is a class distinction the Federal government created, you will see different but similar wealth and investment classes worldwide. So your best most organized opportunities are left out, unless you do qualify as an accredited investor. There are tons of other companies, things you will find locally, that will let you invest in their smaller time operations. Think like a local yoga studio looking for 20,000 and willing to split the profits with you. But the problem here is lack of accountability, where partners skip town or just stop answering your calls, and the legal remedies cost you more than your claim.

They have opportunities do much better than the actual stock market investors in these companies, because you can negotiate contracts that let you cash out in their inevitable financing death spirals with very little risk to you.

What might have occurred viz the Patriot Berry Farm becoming Cyberfort is that the latter bought up the stock of the former this is, I believe, called using a shell, which is not necessarily a bad thing and is using this as a way to be registered, i.e. sell to nonaccredited investors via the OTC market. So Im really just answering your third question yes, you have to do a lot of due diligence to see if buying this stock is a good deal or not. It might be the next big thing. Or it might not. It certainly is the case that low trading volume allows a relatively small trade to really change the stock price, so the penny stocks do tend to be easier to inflate.

    "body": "The risk of any investment is measured by its incremental effect on the volatility of your overall personal wealth, including your other investments.

Common measures of risk, such as beta, assume that you have wholemarket diversified portfolio. In the case of an investment that may or may not be hedged against currency movements, we cant say whether the hedge adds or removes risk for you without knowing what else is in your portfolio. If you are an EU citizen with nominally delimited savings or otherwise stand to lose buying power if the Euro depreciates relative to the dollar, than the \"hedged\" ETF is less risky than the \"unhedged\" version. On the other hand, if your background risk is such that you benefit from that depreciation, then the reverse is true. \"Hedging\" means reducing the risk already present in your portfolio. In this case it does not refer to reducing the individual volatility of the ETF. It may or may not do that but individual asset volatility and risk are two very different things."

In fact, there is no investment that is safe for an absolute beginner, not even a savings account. An absolute beginner could easily overdraw his savings account, leading to fees and collections. I would say that an investment becomes a good fit for an investor as soon as said investor understands how the investment works. A savings account at a bank or credit union is fairly easy to understand and is therefore a suitable place to hold money after a few hours to a day of research. Even after 0 hours of research, however, a savings account is still better than a sock drawer. Money market accounts through a bank, certificates of deposit through a bank, and money market mutual funds through a mutual fund provider are probably the next easiest thing to understand. This could take a few hours to a few weeks of research depending on the learner. Equities, corporate bonds, and government bonds are another step up in complexity, and could take weeks or months of schooling to understand well enough to try. Equity or bond mutual funds  or the ETF versions of those, which is what you asked about  are another level after that.

    "body": "Were capital gains taxes not lower, companies would have an incentive to minimize the portion of the value they create that materializes as capital gains. They would do this by using more debt financing since interest is deductible than equity financing. This would have a destabilizing effect on the economy. Low capital gains taxes help encourage investment over spending. This is believed to improve economic growth. Given these factors, it is generally believed that the current capital gains tax rate is very close to the optimal rate. That is, a higher tax rate would not result in greater tax revenue. Bluntly, a higher income tax rate on earned income does not really discourage people from working harder and earning more money. But a higher rate on capital gains does discourage investment. Essentially, its because investment is more discretionary."

Otherwise if you have an intention for the loan to never be repaid, it is in fact a gift, which is not only not deductible  its taxable. Bottom line  be careful and talk to a EACPA to get a proper advice with regards to a specific transaction. Edit to answer your revised question youre not going to pay taxes if youre not going to have gains. However, if you lose the principal, in addition to the said above you would incur the loss as a personal bad debt, and not business. This is because it is not investment. The difference is in tax treatment personal bad debt is a shortterm capital loss limited deduction, business is an ordinary loss."

With the information on your credit report, you are a poor risk. Assuming your family is unable to pay loan on time and assuming you arent willing to do so, you desperately need to get your name off the loan. This may mean selling the property and closing out the loan. This wont be enough to fix your credit, though. All that will do is stop making your credit worse. Itll take a few years five years in Canada, not sure how many years in India until this loan stops showing up on your credit report. Thats why it is important to do this immediately. Now, can a bank give you a loan or a credit card despite bad credit? Yes, absolutely. It all depends on how bad your credit is. If the bank is willing to do so, theyll most likely charge a higher interest rate. But the bank may well decide not to give you a loan. After all, your credit report shows you dont make your loan payments on time. You may also want to request your own copy of your credit report. You may have to pay for this, especially if you want to see your score. This could be valuable information if you are looking to fix your finances, and may be worth the cost. If you are sure its just this one loan, it may not be necessary. Good luck! Edit In India CIBIL is the authority that maintains records. Getting to know you exact score will help. CIBIL offers it via TransUnion. The nonpayment will keep appearing on your record for 3 years. As you dont have any loans, get a credit card from a Bank where you have Fixed Deposits  PPF Account as it would be easier to get one. It can then help you build the credit."

Therefore most employees have only a small minority of their retirement savings in company shares. I know the ESOP and 401K arent the same, but in my company every year the number of participants in the company stock purchase program decreases. The small number of participants and the small portion of their new retirement funds being in company shares would mean this spike in volume would be very small. The ESOP plan for my employer takes money each paycheck, then purchases the shares once a quarter. This delay would allow them to manage the purchases better.

    "body": "Based on my research, the answer is both. You would pay taxes on the bitcoin you mine as income, and then capital gains tax when you sell them for a profit or capital loss if you lose value on the sale. You can write off a portion of your electricity bill and hardware purchased for the use of mining as a business expense, but its recommended that you consult a tax professional for determining the proper amount that is eligible for a deduction. From Forbes New Bitcoin are being issued by the system roughly every 10 minutes by a process called mining. In mining, computers running the Bitcoin software around the world attempt to solve math problems and the first computer to come up with the solution adds the most recent transactions to the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions, plus receives the new bitcoins created by the system, called the block reward. If you are a miner and win the block reward, you must record the fair market value of Bitcoin that day and mark that as an addition to your personal or business income. Also note the date and timestamp at which your coins were mined. Later, when you dispose of those Bitcoin, you will subtract the date of acquisition from the date of disposal, and you will be taxed a longterm capital gains rate on any Bitcoin you held for more than a year, and a shortterm capital gains rate on any Bitcoin you held for a year or less. The timestamp isnt absolutely necessary, but is helpful to validate the order of multiple acquisitions or disposals within a day. The amount you pay in taxes on a longterm capital gain will depend on your incometax bracket, while shortterm capital gains are taxed the same as ordinary income. From bitcoin.tax Another clarification in the IRSs March notice was how mining should be treated. Mining is income, on the day of receipt of any coins and at the fair value of those coins. This means that if you mined any Bitcoins or altcoins either solo, as part of a pool, or through a cloud provider, you need to report any coins you received as income. Where it is less clear, is what that dollar value might be, since the fair value is not always as easy to determine. Bitcoins, Litecoins, Dogecoins, are all examples of where there is a direct USD market and so you can easily find out their value of any given day. However, a newly created altcoin that was mined in its early days has no direct market and so how do you determine its value? Or for any altcoin, e.g. ABC coin, that has no direct USD market but does have a BTC market. Does it have a value? Do you have to make a conversion from ABC to BTC to USD? Since there is no clarification yet from the IRS on this issue you should discuss how to proceed with your own tax professional. BitcoinTaxes has taken a prudent approach and calculates value where a fiat or BTC market exists, converting an altcoin to BTC to USD as necessary. And from Bitcoin magazine The IRS also stated mined bitcoins are treated as immediate income at the market value of those mined coins on their date of mining. Most dont know they can write off any losses they have, said Libra founder Jake Benson. The IRS allows you to offset income by up to 3,000 per year on capital losses. If you have losses and you arent writing them off, then its like throwing money away. Nobody likes doing taxes, but if you can owe less or increase your return, then doing your Bitcoin taxes often results in a benefit. In fact, the majority of our users are filing a capital loss, which means theyve actually saved money by using our tool. Benson also gives insight for miners. Mining is considered income, so know the price of Bitcoin at the time you mined it, he said. If you make money on Bitcoin trading, the IRS requires that you report gains with line level detail. The appropriate form for that is 8949, a subform of schedule D. Gains and losses, as outlined above, are treated like every other capital asset."

There is no open market in the sense that you cannot put in a bid to buy, say, 100 shares of VFINX at 217 per share through a brokerage, and if there is a seller willing to sell 100 shares of VFINX to you at 217, then the sale is consummated and you are now the proud owner of 100 shares of VFINX. The only buyer or seller of VFINX is the mutual find itself, and you tell it that you \"want to buy 100 shares of VFINX and please take the money out of my checking account\". If this order is entered before the markets close at 4 pm, the mutual fund determines its share price as of the end of the day, opens a new account for you and puts 100 shares of VFINX in it or adds 100 shares of VFINX to your already existing pile of shares and takes the purchase price out of your checking account via an ACH transfer. Similarly for redeemingselling shares of VFINX that you own and these are held in an account at the mutual fund itself, not by your brokerage you tell the mutual fund to that you \"wish to redeem 100 shares and please send the proceeds to my bank account\" and the mutual fund does this at the end of the day, and the money appears in your bank account via ACH transfer two or three days later. Generally, these transactions do not need to be for round lots of multiples of 100 shares for efficiency most mutual fund will gladly sell you fractional shares down to a thousandth of a share. In contrast, shares of an exchangetraded fund ETF are just like stock shares in that they can be bought and sold on the open market and your broker will charge you fees for buying and selling them. Selling fractional shares on the open market is generally not possible, and trading in round lots is less expensive. Also, trades occur at all times of the stock exchange day, not just at the end of the day as with nonETF funds, and the price can fluctuate during the day too. Many nonETF mutual funds have an ETF equivalent VOO is the symbol for Vanguards SP 500 Index ETF while VFINX is the nonETF version of the same index fund.

The insurance companys concern is that without someone in the home, they will be at risk for breakins, squatters and vandalism. If youve ever seen \"Flip Men\" on Spike, youll know this is a serious concern great show, by the way. They will use a risk model to calculate an estimated risk for the property this is why a seasonal vacation home in a sparselypopulated area is often less of a concern than a family home in an urban area. If they estimate the risk to be low, some insurance companies will allow to you buy back that exclusion so that vacant properties are covered. In your case, they have probably decided that either Your Options First, you need to find a company that is comfortable with taking on the extra risk of a vacant home.

    "header": "What happens to people without any retirement savings?",
    "body": "Im afraid you have missed a few of the outcomes commonly faced by millions of Americans, so I would like to take a moment to discuss a wider range of outcomes that are common in the United States today. Most importantly, some of these happen before retirement is ever reached, and have grave consequences  yet are often very closely linked to financial health and savings. Not planning ahead longterm  1020 years  is generally associated with not planning ahead even for the next few months, so Ill start there. The most common thing that happens is the loss of a job, or illnessinjury that put someone out of work. 6 in 10 adults in the US have less than 500 in savings, so desperation can set in very quickly, as the very next paycheck will be short or missing. Many of these Americans have no other source of saved money, either, so its not like they can draw on retirement savings, as they dont have that either. Even if they are able to get another job or recover enough to get back to work in a few weeks, this can set off a desperate cycle. Those who have lost their jobs to technical obsolescence, major economic downturns, or large economic changes are often more severely affected. People once making excellent, middleclass or above wages with full benefits find they cannot find work that pays even vaguely similarly. In the past this was especially common in heavy labor jobs like manufacturing, meatpacking, and so on, but more recently this has happened in financial sectors and real estateconstruction during the 2008 economic events. The more resilient people had padding, switched careers, and found other options  the less resilient, didnt. Especially during the 1970s and 1980s, many people affected by large losses of earning potential became sufficiently desperate that they fell heavily or lost their functioning status into substance abuse, including alcohol and drugs cocaine and heroine being especially popular in this segment of the population. Life disruption  made even more major by a lack of savings  is a key trigger to many people who are already at risk of issues like substance addiction, mental health, or any ongoing legal issues. Another common issue is something more simple, like loss of transportation that threatens their ability to hold their job, and a lack of alternatives available through support networks, savings, family, and public transit. If their credit is bad, or their income is new, they may find even disreputable companies turn them away, or even worse  the most disreputable companies welcome them in with high interest and hairtrigger repossession policies. The most common cycle of desperation I have seen usually starts with banking overdrafts, and its associated fees. People who are afraid and desperate start to make increasingly desperate, shortsighted choices, as tunnelvision sets in and they are unable to consider longerterm strategy as they focus on holding on to what they have and survival. Many industries have found this set of people quite profitable, including highinterest \"check cashing\", payday loans, and title loans aka legal loan sharks, and it is not rare that desperate people are encouraged to get on increasing cycles of loan amounts and fees that worsen their financial situation in exchange for shortterm relief. As fees, penalties, and interest add up, they lose more and more of their already strained income to stay afloat. Banks that are otherwise reputable and fair may soon blacklist them and turn them away, and suddenly only the least reputable and most predatory places offer to help at all  usually with a big smile at first, and almost always with awful strings attached. Drugs and alcohol are often readily available nearby and their use can easily turn from recreational to addictive given the allure of the escapism it offers, especially for those made vulnerable by increasing stress, desperation, loss of hope, isolation, and fear. Those who have not been within the system of poverty and desperation often do not see just how many people actively work to encourage bad decision making, with big budgets, charm, charisma, and talent. The voices of reason, trying to act as beacons to call people to take care of themselves and their future, are all too easily drowned out in the roar of a smooth and enticing operation. I personally think this is one of the greatest contributions of the movement to build personal financial health and awareness, as so many great people find ever more effective ways of pointing out the myriad ways people try to bleed your money out of you with no real concern for your welfare. Looking out for your own wellbeing and not being taking in by the wide array of cons and bad deals is all too often fighting against a strong societal current  as Im sure most of our regular contributors are all too aware! With increasing desperation often comes illegal maneuvers, often quite petty in nature. Those with substance abuse issues often start reselling drugs to others to try to cover lost income or \"get ahead\", with often debilitating results on longterm earning potential if they get caught which can include cost barriers to higher education, even if they do turn their life around. I think most people are surprised by how little and petty things can quickly cycle out of control. This can include things like not paying minor parking or traffic tickets, which can snowball from the 1070 range into thousands of dollars due to nonpayment often escalating and adding additional penalties, triggering traffic stops for no other reason, etc., arrest, and more. The elderly are not exempt from this system, and many of Americas elderly spend their latter years in prison. While not all are tied to financial desperation as Ive outlined above, a deeper look at poverty, crime, and the elderly will be deeply disturbing. Some of these people enter the system while young, but some only later in life. Rather than homelessness being something that only happens after people hit retirement, it often comes considerably earlier than that. If this occurs, the outcome is generally quite a bit more extreme than living off social security  some just die. The average life expectancy of adults who are living on the street is only about 64 years of age  only 2 years into early retirement age, and before full retirement age which could of course be increased in the next 1020 years, even if life expectancy and health of those without savings dont improve. Most have extremely restricted access to healthcare often being emergency only, and have no comforts of home to rest and recuperate when they become ill or injured. There are many people dedicated to helping, yet the help is far less than the problem generally, and being able to take advantage of most of the help scheduling where to go for food, who to talk to about other services, etc heavily depends on the person not already suffering from conditions that limit their ability to care for themselves mental conditions, mobility impairments, etc. There is also a shockingly higher risk of physical assault, injury, and death, depending on where the person goes  but it is far higher in almost every case, regardless. One of the chief problems in considering only retirement savings, is it assumes that youll only have need for the savings and good financial health once you reach approximately the age of 62 if it is not raised before you get there, which it has been multiple times todate. As noted above, if homelessness occurs and becomes longstanding before that, the result is generally shortened lifespan and premature death. The other major issue of health is that preventative care  from simple dentistry to basic selfcare, adequate sleep and rest, a safe place to rejuvenate  is often sacrificed in the scrambling to survive and limited budget. Those who develop chronic conditions which need regular care are more severely affected. Diabetic and injuryrelated limb loss, as one example, are far more likely for those without regular support resources  homeless, destitute, or otherwise. Other posters have done a great job in pointing out a number of the lesserknown governmental programs, so I wont list them again. I only note the important proviso that this may be quite a bit less in total than you think. Social Security on average pays retired workers 1300 a month. It was designed to avoid an alltoocommon occurrence of simple starvation, rampant homelessness, and abject poverty among a large number of elderly. No guarantee is made that you wont have to leave your home, move away from your friends and family if you live in an expensive part of the country, etc. Some people get a bit more, some people get quite a bit less. And the loss of family and friend networks  especially to such atrisk groups  can be incredibly damaging. Note also that those financially desperate will be generally pushed to take retirement at the minimum age, even though benefits would be larger and more livable if they delayed their retirement. This is an additional cost of not having other sources of savings, which is not considered by many. Well, yes, many cannot retire whether they want to or not. I cannot find statistics on this specifically, but many are indeed just unable to financially retire without considerable loss. Social Security and other government plans help avoid the most desperate scenarios, but so many aspects of aging is not covered by insurance or affordable on the limited income that aging can be a cruel and lonely process for those with no other financial means. Those with no savings are not likely to be able to afford to regularly visit children and grandchildren, give gifts on holidays, go on cruises, enjoy the best assistive care, or afford new technological devices to assist their aging especially those too new and experimental to be covered by the insurance plans they have. Whats worse  but most people do not plan for either  is that diminished mental and physical capacity can render many people unable to navigate the system successfully. As weve seen here, many questions are from adult children trying to help their elderly parents in retirement, and include aging parents who do not understand their own access to social security, medicaidmedicare, assistive resources, or community help organizations. What happens to those aging without children or younger friend networks to step in and help? Well, we dont really have a replacement for that. I am not aware of any research that quantifies just how many in the US dont take advantage of the resources they are fully qualified to make use of and enjoy, due to a lack of education, social issues feeling embarrassed and afraid, or inability to organize and communicate effectively. A resource being available is not very much help for those who dont have enough supportive resources to make use of it  which is very hard to effectively plan for, yet is exceedingly common. Without ones own independent resources, the natural aging and end of life process can be especially harsh. Elderly who are economically and food insecure experience far heightened incidence of depression, asthma, heart attack, and heart failure, and a host of other maladies. They are at greater risk for elderabuse, accidental death, lifequality threatening conditions developing or worsening, and more. Scaretactics arent always persuasive, and they do little to improve the lives of many because the people who need to know it most generally just dont believe it. But my hope here is that the rather highly educated and sophisticated audience here will see a little more of the harsher world that their own good decisions, good fortune, culture, and position in society shields them from experiencing. There is a downside to good outcomes, which is that it can cause us to be blind to just how extremely different is the experience of others. Not all experience such terrible outcomes  but many hundreds of thousands in the US alone  do, and sometimes worse. It is not helpful to be unrealistic about this life is not inherently kind. However, none of this suggests that being codependent or giving up your own financial wellbeing is necessary or advised to help others. Share your budgeting strategies, your plans for the future, your gentle concerns, and give of your time and resources as generously as you can  within your own set budgets and ensuring your own financial wellbeing. And most of all  do not so easily give up on your family and friends, and count them as lifelong hopeless neerdowells. Lets all strive to be good, kind, honest, and offer nonjudgmental support and advice to the best of our ability to the people we care about. It is ultimately their choice  restricted by their own experiences and abilities  but need not be fate. People regularly disappoint, but sometimes they surprise and delight. Take care of yourself, and give others the best chance you can, too."

This holds true with other indexes as well like the Russel 2000. All that said, youre not going to see a huge difference between SP 500 and SP 500 Growth.

    "body": "While I agree with the existing bulk of comments and answers that you cant tell the lender the 7k is a gift, I do think you might have luck finding a mortgage broker who can help you get a loan as a group. You might consider as an LLC or other form of corporation if no one will take you otherwise. That is, each of you will be an owner of the house and appear on the mortgage. IIRC, as long as the downpayment only comes from the collective group, and the incometodebt ratio of the group as a whole is acceptable, and the strongest credit rating of the group is good, you should be able to find a loan. You may need a formal ownership agreement to get this accepted by the lender. That said, I dont know if your income will trump your brothers situation presumably high debt ratio or lower than 100 multiplier on his income dues to its source, but it will certainly help. As to how to structure the deal for fairness, I think whatever the two of you agree to and put down in writing is fine. If you each think youre helping the other, than a 5050 split on profits at the sale of the property seems reasonable to me. Id recommend that you actually include in your write up a defined maximum period for ownership e.g. 5yr, or 10yr, etc, and explain how things will be resolved if one side doesnt want to sell at that point but the other side does. Just remember that whatever percentages you agree to as ownership wont effect the lenders view of payment requirements. The lender will consider each member of the group fully and independently responsible for the loan. That is, if something happens to your brother, or he just flakes out on you, you will be on the hook for 100 of the loan. And viceversa. Your write up ought to document what happens if one of you flakes out on paying agreed upon amounts, but still expects there ownership share at the time of sale. That said, if youre trying to be mathematically fair about apportioning ownership, you could do something like the below to try and factor in the various issues into the money flow The above has the benefit that you can start with a different ownership split 3466, 2575, etc. if one of you wants to own more of the property."

    "body": "At the area where I live Finland, banks typically charge a lot more for additional mortgage credit taken after purchasing the house. So, if you are planning to purchase a house, and pay it with a mortgage, you get a very good rate, but if you pay back the mortgage and then realize you need additional credit, you get a much worse rate. So, if this is applicable to your area as well, I would simply buy stocks after you have paid enough of the mortgage that it is only 50 of the house price or so. This is especially good advice if you are young. Also, if your mortgage is a fixed rate and not an adjustable rate mortgage, you probably have a very low permanent interest rate on it as interest rates are low currently adjustable rate mortgages will also have a low rate but it will surely go up. Some people say theres a bubble currently in the stock market, but actually the bubble is in the bond market. Stocks are expensive because the other alternatives bonds are expensive as well. Paying back your mortgage is equivalent to investing money in bonds. I dont invest in bonds at the current ridiculously low interest rates I merely invest in stocks and have a small cash reserve that will become even smaller as I discover new investment opportunities. I could pay back a significant percentage about 50 of the loans I have by selling my stocks and using my cash reserves. I dont do that I invest in stocks instead, and am planning to increase my exposure to the stock market at a healthy pace. Also, consider the fact that mortgage is cheap credit. If you need additional credit for consumption due to e.g. becoming suddenly unemployed, you will get it only at very expensive rates, if at all. If youre very near the retirement age Im not, this advice may not be applicable to you. Edit and oh, if your mortgage is fixed rate, and interest rates have come down, the bank will require you to pay the opportunity cost of the unpaid interests. So, you may need to pay more than you owe the bank. Edit2 lets assume the bank offered you a 4 fixed rate for a 10year loan, which you agreed to. Now lets also assume interest rates of new agreements have come down to 2. It would be a loss to the bank to pay back the amount of the loan because the bank cannot get 4 by offering somebody else a new loan, only 2, unless you paid also 10 years  4  2  amount  20  amount of lost interest income.

    "header": "Looking into investment bonds for the first time what do I need to be aware of?",
    "body": "All bonds carry a risk of default, which means that its possible that you can lose your principal investment in addition to potentially not getting the interest payments that you expect. Bonds in the US anyway are graded, so you can manage this risk somewhat by taking higher quality bonds, i.e. in companies or governments that are considered more creditworthy. Regular bank savings again specific to the US are insured by FDIC, so even if your bank goes bust, the US Government is backing them up to some limit. That makes such accounts less risky. Theres generally no insurance on a bond, even if it is issued by a government entity. If you do your homework on the bond rating system and choose bonds in a rating band where youre comfortable, this could be a good option for you. Youll find, however, that the bond market also \"knows\" that the interest rates are generally low, so be ware that higher interest issues are usually coming from less creditworthy and therefore more risky issuers. EDIT Heres some additional information based on the followup question in the comment. When you buy a bond you are actually making a loan to the issuer. They will pay you interest over the lifetime of the bond and then return your principal at the end of the term. Verify this payment schedule  This is typical, but you should be sure that whatever youre buying works like this. This is not an investment in the value of the issuer itself like you would be making if you bought stock. With stock you are taking an ownership share in the company. This might entitle you to dividends if the company pays them, but otherwise your investment value on a stock will be tied to the performance of the company. With the bond, the company might be in decline but the bond still a good investment so long as the company doesnt decline so much that they cannot pay their debts. Also, bonds can be issued by governments, but governments do not sell stock. An \"ownership share of the government\" would not make sense. This may be the socalled sovereign debt if issued by a sovereign government or it may be local we call it municipal here in the US debt issued by a subordinate level of government. Bonds are a little bit like stock in the sense that theres a secondary market for them. That means that if you get partway through the length of the bond and dont want to hold it, you can sell the bond to someone else. Of course, it will be harder to sell a bond later if the company becomes insolvent or if the interest rates go up between when you buy and when you sell. Depending on these market factors, you might end up with a capital gain or capital loss meaning you get more or less than the principal that you put into the bond at the time of a sale."

    "body": "I would say that all of the reasons you list in your question are valid, and I would add the following... You are in the landscaping business, not the accounting business. If you manage everything in spreadsheets, at least one of you has to become the bookkeeper and leave the landscaping to the others. Spreadsheets are \"agnostic\" in how you use them, so you have to turn them into an accounting system, which means youre now not only more of a bookkeeper, but youre also more of a developer, too, and even less of a landscaper. Accounting software is already developed by developers who understand accounting. Using it requires you to only perform the data entry tasks, and then you can focus on the landscaping, customer service, sales and marketing, etc., things that actually contribute to your business. It is still good for you to understand basic accounting principles. Specialized accounting software will guide you through the process of learning and help you avoid making many of the costly mistakes you might have made in that learning process."

Traditionally their cards have been charge cards instead of a credit card though they have credit products now as well. Theyve been marketed specifically as a \"premium\" product for people who have a significant amount of money and are willing to pay a significant fee for premium services such as AmExs good airline miles. As such, Visa and MasterCard are more widespread. Additionally, the fees that Visa and MasterCard charge merchants are typically lower Wikipedia says 2, as compared to AmExs 2.5, at least in the US.

If you were getting something like 2 of a third of all the retail transactions in the US, youd probably not want to rock the boat too much either. Since there is little fraud relative to the amount of money they are taking in, and it can often be detected using statistical analysis, they dont really stand to gain that much by reducing it through these methods. Sure they can reduce the losses on the insurance they provide to the credit card consumer but they risk slowing down the money machine. These companies want avoid doing something like reducing fraud by 0.5 revenues but causing purchases with the cards drop by 1. More security will be implemented as we can see with the slow introduction of chip cards in the US but only at a pace that will prevent disruption of the money machine.

I note that you said you chose some funds based on performance since the expense ratios are all high. I would recommend against chasing performance because active funds will almost always falter honor the old saw \"past performance is no guarantee of future returns\". Assuming the cash in your Ally account is an emergency fund, I would use it to pay off your credit card debt to avoid the interest payments. Use free cash flow in the coming months to bring the emergency fund balance back up to an acceptable level. If the Ally account is not an emergency fund, I would make it one! With no debt and an emergency fund for 312 months of living expenses pick your risk tolerance, then you can concentrate on investing. Your 401k options are unfortunately pretty poor. With those choices I would invest this way Once you fill up your choice of IRA, then you have the tougher decision of where to put any extra money you have to invest if any. A brokerage account gives you the freedom of investment choices and the ability to easily pull out money in the case of a dire emergency. The 401k will give you tax benefits, but high fund expenses. The tax benefits are considerable, so if I were at a job where I plan on moving on in a few years, Id fund the 401k up to the max with the knowledge that Id roll the 401k into a rollover IRA in the relatively short term. If I saw myself staying at the employer for a long time 5 years, Id probably take the taxable account route since those high fund fees will add up over time. One you start building up a solid base, then I might look into having a small allocation in one of my accounts for \"play money\" to pick individual stocks, or start making sector bets."

    "header": "How do 401k handle rate of return",
    "body": "Your employer sends the money that you choose to contribute, plus employer match if any, to the administrator of the 401k plan who invests the money as you have directed, choosing between the alternatives offered by the administrator. Typically, the alternatives are several different mutual funds with different investment styles, e.g. a SP 500 index fund, a bond fund, a moneymarket fund, etc. Now, a statement such as \"I see my 401k is up 10\" is meaningless unless you tell us how you are making the comparison. For example, if you have just started employment and 200 goes into your 401k each month and is invested in a moneymarket fund these are paying close to 0 interest these days, then your 11th contribution increases your 401k from 2000 to 2200 and your 401k is \"up 10\". More generally, suppose for simplicity that all the 401k investment is in just one stock mutual fund and that you own 100 shares of the fund as of right now. Suppose also that your next contribution will not occur for three weeks when you get your next paycheck, at which time additional shares of the mutual fund will be purchased Now, the value of the mutual fund shares often referred to as net asset value or NAV fluctuates as stock prices rise and fall, and so the 401k balance  number of shares times NAV changes in accordance with these fluctuations. So, if the NAV increases by 10 in the next two weeks, your 401k balance will have increased by 10. But you still own only 100 shares of the mutual fund. You cannot use the 10 increase in value to buy more shares in the mutual fund because there is no money to pay for the additional shares you wish to purchase. Notice that there is no point selling some of the shares at the 10 higher NAV to get cash because you will be purchasing shares at the higher NAV too. You could, of course, sell shares of the stock mutual fund at the higher NAV and buy shares of some other fund available to you in the 401k plan. One advantage of doing this inside the 401k plan is that you dont have to pay taxes now on the 10 gain that you have made on the sale. Outside taxdeferred plans such as 401k and IRA plans, such gains would be taxable in the year of the sale. But note that selling the shares of the stock fund and buying something else indicates that you believe that the NAV of your stock mutual fund is unlikely to increase any further in the near future. A third possibility for your 401k being up by 10 is that the mutual fund paid a dividend or made a capital gains distribution in the two week period that we are discussing. The NAV falls when such events occur, but if you have chosen to reinvest the dividends and capital gains, then the number of shares that you own goes up. With the same example as before, the NAV goes up 10 in two weeks at which time a capital gains distribution occurs, and so the NAV falls back to where it was before. So, before the capital gains distribution, you owned 100 shares at 10 NAV which went up to 11 NAV 10 increase in NAV for a net increase in 401k balance from 1000 to 1100. The mutual fund distributes capital gains in the amount of 1 per share sending the NAV back to 10, but you take the 100 distribution and plow it back into the mutual fund, purchasing 10 shares at the new 10 NAV. So now you own 110 shares at 10 NAV no net change in price in two weeks but your 401k balance is 1100, same as it was before the capital gains distribution and you are up 10. Or, you could have chosen to invest the distributions into, say, a bond fund available in your 401k plan and still be up 10, with no change in your stock fund holding, but a new investment of 100 in a bond fund. So, being up 10 can mean different things and does not necessarily mean that the \"return\" can be used to buy more shares."

WARNING as JosephZambrano explains in his answer the tax penalty for withdrawing from a 401k can easily exceed the APR of the credit card making it a very bad strategy. Consult indepth with a financial advisor to see before taking that path. As JoeTaxpayer has noted a loan is another alternative. The 401k is no good to you if you cant have shelter or comfort in the mean time. The idea is to look at all the money as a single thing and balance it together. There is no credit and retirement, just a single target that you can hit by moving the good money to clear the bad. Consolidating the credit card debt somehow would be very wise if you can. Assuming it is 30 APR shrinking that quickly is the first priority. You may be able to justify a hardship withdrawal to finance the reductionconsolidation of the credit card. It may be worth considering negotiating a closure arrangement with a reduced principal. Credit card companies can be quite open to this as it gets their money back. You may also be able to negotiate a lower interest rate. You may be able to negotiate a noncreditaffecting debt consolidation with a debt consolidator. They want to make money and a 25K loan to a person with sound credit is a pretty good bet. Moving, buying a house, or any of that may just relocate the problem. You may be able to withdraw 25K from your 401k under hardship, pay the credit card, and come up with a payment plan for the medical debt. Its a retirement setback for sure, but retirement is an illusion with that credit card shark eating all of your hardearned money. You gotta slay that beast quick. Again, be sure to fully analyze whether the penalty on the 401k withdrawal exceeds the APR of the credit card."

    "header": "Diagnostic Questions to Determine if Renter intends to pay",
    "body": "Firstly, how far behind on rent are they? Have you sent them notices in writing about late rent, and if so how many have you had to send? How often do they say they are going to do things like pay overdue rent and they never do? To tell you the truth IMHO, if they are starting to be regularly late in rent payments and they dont do things they say they are going to do  then it is time to evict them. In NSW Australia, if the tenant is more than 2 weeks late in rent, and prior to them reaching 2 weeks late you have called them asking for late rent and sent notices, you can evict the tenants. If the tenants do not leave you can apply to the Tribunal to get them out and ask for outstanding money to be paid to you. However, if it does get to this stage, the tenants may be pissed off so may do some damage to the property in retaliation. Then you have to go back to the Tribunal to get the Tenants Bond Security Deposit and any other funds to repair any damages done to your place. The longer you leave it the worse it will get. We had some tenants similar to this which we finally got out earlier this year. They would say they would pay rent due by the end of the week and no money would come by the end of the week. We took them to Tribunal and got them out, and we got the Bond plus unpaid rent and other money for damages and leaving the place dirty over and above the Bond awarded to us  just under 4K. The tenants said they couldnt pay and so went on a payment plan to pay about 135 every 2 weeks. They didnt pay any of the payments, so then we went to the local court to get a sheriff to go to their new place and take their property. The must have gotten scared from this because they approached the local court and agreed to pay 60 per week. We have currently received about 10 payments so it will be a long time before we get all our money back. As I said the longer you leave it the worse it can get. You should also look at improving your criteria for selecting new tenants. I have given an answer to this question How to choose a good tenant as a private landlord? Hopefully it can give you some ideas of what to ask for when searching for your next tenant. Update due update in Question Six weeks behind in rent is quite a bit to be behind. If the landlord had been asking the tenant to pay the late rent during this period and the tenant had been giving excuses why the rent was late and saying they would pay it by a certain time but never did  it is a big sign that they will tell you lies. If this is the first time they have been late in paying rent and now they are back up to date with the rent, you might want to give them one more chance. If this is a pattern that happens regularly it is better to get them out, as it will happen again, you will get in an argument with them and then they might stop paying rent altogether. You can usually gain a better perspective of the tenants from their action rather than their words  that is why ascertaining their past rental history is so important when finding a new tenant."

What if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live? Having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk. 2 Lagerbaer has a good suggestion. Given that if youd reinvested your dividends, the SP 500 has returned about 3.5 over the last 5 years, you may be able to get a very nice riskfree return. 3 Do you have access to employer matching funds, such as in a 401k at work? If you get a dollarfordollar match, that is a riskfree pretax 100 return and should be a high priority. 4 What do you mean by \"medium\" volatility? Given that you are considering a 23 equity allocation, it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15 or more in any given year and take several years to recover. If that would spook you, you may want to consider lowering your equity weights. A high quality bond fund may be a good fit. 5 Personally, I would avoid putting money into stocks that I didnt need back for 10 years. If you only want to tie your money up for 25 years, you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall, you wont have time to recover before you need your money back. The portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a longterm investment horizon and significant risk tolerance, which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement. However, if your goals are to invest for 25 years only, your situation would be significantly different. 6 You can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence, but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees, unless you plan to liquidate assets. If you plan to buy a house, saving enough to avoid PMI is a good riskfree return on your money. 7 In general, and ETF or index fund is a good idea, the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term. There are many good choices a la Vanguard here to choose from. 8 Dont worry about \"Buy low, sell high\". Dont be a speculator, be an investor thats my version of Anthony Bourdains, \"dont be a tourist, be a traveler\". A speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at. An investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a partowner. If you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions, good for you  you can move to Wall Street and make millions. However, almost no one can do this consistently, and it doesnt seem worth it to me to try. I dont mean to discourage you from investing, just make sure you have your bases covered so that you dont have to cash out at a bad time. Best of luck! Edit Response to additional questions below. 1 Emergency fund. I would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents money market, shortterm CDs, etc. until youve built up an emergency fund. It makes sense to want to make the \"best\" use of your money, but you also have to account for risk. My concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events, that you could lose a lot of money, or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt, and it would be prudent to selfinsure against some of those risks. I would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account. Taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissionstaxesfees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns. Ideally, you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns. There are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds. Just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month, you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility, even if they are less common. Using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this. 2 Invest at all? I would recommend starting an emergency fund, and then beginning to invest for retirement. Once your retirement savings are on track, you can begin saving for whatever other goals you may have"

If someone accessed your mint account they would not be able to perform any transactions with your bank. All they would be able to do is view the same information you do, which some of it could be personal  thats up to you. Generally the weakest point in security is with the user. An \"attacker\" is far more likely to get your account information from you then he is from the site your registered with. Why youre the weakest point When you enter your account information, your password is never saved exactly how you enter it. Its passed through what is called a \"one way function\", these functions are easy to compute one way but given the endresult is EXTREMELY difficult to compute in reverse. So in a database if someone looked up your password they would see it something like this \"31435008693ce6976f45dedc5532e2c1\". When you log in to an account your password is sent through this function and then the result is checked against what is saved in the database, if they match you are granted access. The way an attacker would go about getting your password is by entering values into the function and checking the values against yours, this is known as a brute force attack. For our example 31435008693ce6976f45dedc5532e2c1 it would take someone 5 million years to decrypt using a basic brute force attack. I used \"thisismypassword\" as my example password, its 12 characters long. This is why most sites urge you to create long passwords with a mix of numbers, uppercase, lowercase and symbols. This is a very basic explanation of security and both sides have better tools then the one explained but this gives you an idea of how security works for sites like these. Youre far more likely to get a virus or a key logger steal your information. I do use Mint. Edit From the Mint FAQ Do you store my bank login information on your servers? Your bank login credentials are stored securely in a separate database using multilayered hardware and software encryption. We only store the information needed to save you the trouble of updating, syncing or uploading financial information manually. Edit 2 From OFX About Security Open Financial Exchange OFX is a unified specification for the electronic exchange of financial data between financial institutions, businesses and consumers via the Internet. This is how mint is able to communicate with even your small local bank. FINAL EDIT  This answers everything  For passwords to Mint itself, we compute a secure hash of the users chosen password and store only the hash the hash is also salted  see httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSal... . Hashing is a oneway function and cannot be reversed. It is not possible to ever see or recover the password itself. When the user tries to login, we compute the hash of the password they are attempting to use and compare it to the hashed value on record. This is a standard technique which every site should use. For banking credentials, we generally must use reversible encryption for which we have special procedures and secure hardware kept in our secure and guarded datacenter. The decryption keys never leave the hardware device which is built to destroy the key material if the tamper protection is attacked. This device will only decrypt after it is activated by a quorum of other keys, each of which is stored on a smartcard and also encrypted by a password known to only one person. Furthermore the device requires a timelimited cryptographicallysigned permission token for each decryption.

A revolving account is an account created by a lender to represent debts where the outstanding balance does not have to be paid in full every month by the borrower to the lender. The borrower may be required to make a minimum payment, based on the balance amount. Retail Revolving Account Wikipedia This is different from something like a car loan or mortgage or other more structured or secured debt. It used to be somewhat common for very large retailers to issue lines of credit to their customers in the form of a store card. This card was a lot like a credit card but only accepted at the specific retailer. These kinds of cards are all but extincted. Now major retailers will simply cobrand a credit card with a major bank, the differentiation being preferred rewards when used at the retailer."

    "body": "When you are starting out using a balanced fund can be quite advantageous. A balanced fund is represents a diversified portfolio in single fund. The primary advantage of using a balanced fund is that with it being a single fund it is easier to meet the initial investment minimum. Later once you have enough to transition to a portfolio of diversified funds you would sell the fund and buy the portfolio. With a custom portfolio, you will be better able to target your risk level and you might also be able to use lower cost funds. The other item to check is do any of the funds that you might be interested in for the diversified portfolio have lower initial investment option if you can commit to adding money on a specified basis assuming that you are able to. Also there might be an ETF version of a mutual fund and for those the initial investment amount is just the share price. The one thing to be aware of is make sure that you can buy enough shares that you can rebalance holding a single share makes it hard to sell some gain when rebalancing. I would stay away from individual stocks until you have a much larger portfolio, assuming that you want to invest with a diversified portfolio. The reason being that it takes a lot more money to create a diversified portfolio out of individual stocks since you have to buy whole shares. With a mutual fund or ETF, your underlying ownership of can be fractional with no issue as each fund share is going to map into a fraction of the various companies held and with mutual funds you can buy fractional shares of the fund itself."

    "header": "What taxes are assessed on distributions of an inherited IRA?",
    "body": "All transactions within an IRA are irrelevant as far as the taxation of the distributions from the IRA are concerned. You can only take cash from an IRA, and a cash distribution from a Traditional IRA is taxable as ordinary income same as interest from a bank, say without the advantage of any of the special tax rates for longterm capital gains or qualified dividends even if that cash was generated within the IRA from sales of stock etc. In short, just as with what is alleged to occur with respect to Las Vegas, what happens within the IRA stays within the IRA. Note some IRA custodians are willing to make a distribution of stock or mutual fund shares to you, so that ownership of the 100 shares of GE, say, that you hold within your IRA is transferred to you in your personal nonIRA brokerage account. But, as far as the IRS is concerned, your IRA custodian sold the stock as the closing price on the day of the distribution, gave you the cash, and you promptly bought the 100 shares at the closing price in your personal brokerage account with the cash that you received from the IRA. It is just that your custodian saved the transaction fees involved in selling 100 shares of GE stock inside the IRA and you saved the transaction fee for buying 100 shares of GE stock in your personal brokerage account. Your basis in the 100 shares of GE stock is the \"cash that you imputedly received as a distribution from the IRA, so that when you sell the shares at some future time, your capital gains or losses will be with respect to this basis. The capital gains that occurred within the IRA when the shares were imputedly sold by your IRA custodian remain within the IRA, and you dont get to pay taxes on that at capital gains rates. That being said, I would like to add to what NathanL told you in his answer. Your mother passed away in 2011 and you are now 60 years old so 54 or 55 in 2011?. It is likely that your mother was over 70.5 years old when she passed away, and so she likely had started taking Required Minimum Distributions from her IRA before her death. So, You should have been taking RMDs from the Inherited IRA starting with Year 2012. The RMD for 2011, if not taken already by your mother before she passed away, should have been taken by her estate, and distributed to her heirs in accordance with her will, or, if she died intestate, in accordance with state law andor probate court directives. There would not have been any 10 penalty tax due on the RMDs taken by you on the grounds that you were not 59.5 years old as yet that rule applies to owners your mom in this case and not to beneficiaries you in this case. So, have you taken the RMDs for 20122016? Or were you waiting to turn 59.5 before taking distributions in the mistaken belief that you would have to pay a 10 penalty for early wthdrawal? The penalty for not taking a RMD is 50 of the amount not distributed yes, 50. If you didnt take RMDs from the Inherited IRA for years 20122016, I recommend that you consult a CPA with expertise in tax law. Ask the CPA if heshe is an Enrolled Agent with the IRS Enrolled Agents have to pass an exam administered by the IRS to show that they really understand tax law and are not just blowing smoke, and can represent you in front of the IRS in cases of audit etc,"

    "body": "Nearly every country has its own exchange because so many countries have their own currency, and currency permeates every part of an exchanges business. Generally, an exchange will support transaction and settlement only in local currency. Securities except those that explicitly enable FX trading are denominated and will trade in a single currency you can only buy a share of IBM in U.S. dollars. Securities trading always seeks to be a clean, frictionless, scalable process, and adding crosscurrency translation to the mix would just complicate things. So its one exchange, one currency. In most countries, citizens and even businesses are largely restricted to having bank accounts in local currency. There are various political reasons for this, but there it is it is difficult or impossible to open a domestic bank account in a foreigndenominated currency. A public company headquartered in a given country will be required to publish financial statements in local currency, will be more likely to do business with the local citizenry and businesses in that currency, and so will likely look for investors from that same pool which generally means listing in local currency, which means on an exchange in that country. There are exceptions, of course. Big multinationals do business all over the world, and many seek investors all over the world as well. Mechanisms have been created to permit this American Depositary Receipts or ADRs, for example. But once again, crosscurrency translation makes things more complicated, so ADRs and their like are only practical for very big international players. As to why there may be many exchanges in a single country, IMO Nick R has it right. Read \"Flash Boys\" many market makers profit from trading between exchanges, and so have an interest in there being many of them. And in the U.S., regulators have expressed an interest in \"innovation\" in the exchange space, and so permit them. There is also an argument to be made against having a single \"Too Big To Fail\" exchange just like the argument for banks, but I wouldnt call that a \"reason\" for the current state of affairs."

    "header": "Why would a car company lend me money at a very low interest rate?",
    "body": "This is \"incentive financing\". Simply put, the car company isnt in the business of making money by buying government bonds. Theyre in the business of making money by selling cars. If you are \"qualified\" from a credit standpoint, and want to buy a 20k car on any given Sunday, youll typically be offered a loan of between 6 and 9. Lets say this loan is for three years and you can offer 4000 down payment andor trade. The required monthly payment on the remaining 16k at the high end of 9 is 508.80, which over 3 years means youll pay 2,316.64 in interest. Now, that may sound like a good chunk of change, and for the ordinary individual, it is, possibly enough that you decide not to buy today. Now, lets say, all other things being equal, that the company is offering 0.9 incentive financing. Same price, same down payment, same loan term. Your payments over 3 years decrease to 450.64, and over the same loan term you would only pay 222.97 in interest. You save over 2,093.67 in interest over three years, which for you is again a decent chunk of change. Theoretically, the car companys losing that same 2,093.67 in interest by offering this deal, and depending on how its getting the money it lends you most financial companies are middlemen, getting money from bondbuying investors who expect a rate of return, that could be a real loss and not just opportunity cost. But, that incentive got you to walk in their door, and not their competitors. It helped convince you to buy the 20,000 car. The gross margin on that car price minus direct costs is typically 20 for the dealer, plus another 20 for the manufacturer, so by giving up the 2,000 on the financing side, the dealer and manufacturer just earned themselves 4 times that much. On top of that, by buying that car, youre committing to buy the parts for the car, a side business with even higher margins, of which the car company gets a pretty big chunk. You may even be required to use dealer service while the cars under warranty in order to keep the warranty valid, another chaching. When you get right down to it, the loss from the incentive financing is drowned in the gross profits they make from selling the car to you. Now, in reality, its a fine balance. The percentages I mentioned are gross margins EBITDASGA  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, Sales, General and Administrative costs basically, just revenue minus direct cost of goods sold. Add in all these side costs and you get a net margin of only about 3.5 of revenue, so your 20k car purchase may only make the car companys stakeholders 700 on the sale, plus slightly higher net margins on parts and service over the life of the car. Because incentive financing is typically only offered through the companys own financing subsidiary, the loss isnt in the form of a cost paid, but simply a revenue not realized, but it can still move a car company from net positive to net negative earnings if the program is too successful. This is why not everyone does it, and not all at the same time if youre selling enough cars without it, why give away money? Typically, these incentives are offered for two reasons to clear out old cars or excess inventory, or to maintain ground against a competitors stronger sales numbers. Keeping cars on a lot ready to sell is expensive, and so is not having your brand driving around on the street turning heads and imprinting their name on the minds of potential customers."

My previous CFD Broker  CMC Markets, used to allow you to adjust the leverage from the maximum allowed for that stock say 5 to 100 of your own money before you place a trade. So obviously if you set it at 100 you pay no interest on holding open long positions overnight. If you cant find a broker that allows this as I dont think there would be too many around, you can always trade within your account size. For example, if you have an account size of 20,000 then you only take out trades that have a face value up to the 20,000. When you become more experienced and confident you can increase this to 2 or 3 time your account size. Maybe, if you are just starting out, you should first open a virtual account to test your strategies out and get used to using leverage. You should put together a trading plan with position sizing and risk management before starting real trading, and you can test these in your virtual trading before putting real money on the table. Also, if you want to avoid leverage when first starting out, you could always start trading the underlying without any leverage, but you should still have a trading plan in place first."

What happens is that if you sell goods with VAT and charge customers VAT, you would have to send that VAT straight to HMRC, but if your business itself paid VAT, then you already paid VAT, so you have to send less. As an example, if you send an invoice for 10,000 plus 2,000 VAT, and you paid yourself 500 VAT on business related expenses, then you need to send 2,000  500  1,500 to HMRC. But if you dont send invoices including VAT, then you owe HMRC 0. Any VAT you paid on business related expenses is lost HMRC wont pay you money. BTW. Only VAT on business related expenses can be deducted. So if you want to be \"smart\", register for VAT and get the VAT on your weekly shopping bill refunded, forget it."

If you sell and there is a capital gain of 3000, then you will pay taxes on the 3000. If 33 is your marginal tax rate, and if you held the stock for less than a year, then you will keep 7000 and pay taxes of 1000. Somehow, I doubt your marginal tax rate is 33. If you hold the stock for a year after eTrade sold some for you to pay taxes, then you will pay 15 on the gain  or 450. eTrade sold the shares to pay the taxes generated by the income. Yes, those shares were considered income. If you sell and have a loss, well, life sucks. However, if you sell something else, you can use the loss to offset the other gain. So if you sell stock A for a loss of 3000, and sell stock B at a gain of 4000, then you pay taxes on the net of 1000."

If they have 50 million mortgages between the 3 of them and 20 of people at one point wont be able to pay their mortgage due to loss of income or other factors, this presents a risk factor. Although interest payments are still good, reducing their principal and interest keeps them tied down for additional or sometimes shorter time, but now they are more likely to keep getting those payments. Thats why credit cards back in 07 and 08 reduced limits for customers. The risk factor is huge now for these financial institutions. Do your research, sometimes a refi isnt the best option.

So currently youre in the clear and Part 2 Section 6.2.a says the Bill cannot be used retroactively against you if your relationship is over before it becomes law I expect with Brexit etc, this Bill isnt a high priority  its been a year since the first reading. Section 6.2.a This Part does not apply to former cohabitants where the former cohabitants have ceased living together as a couple before the commencement date However, if youre still together ifwhen this Bill becomes Law then basically all of Part 1 Section 2 may be relevant as it notes the conditions you will fall into this bill Section 2.1.a live together as a couple and Section 2.2.d have lived together as a couple for a continuous period of three years or more. and the \"have lived together\" at that point counts from the start of your cohabitation, not the start of the Bill being law Section 2.4.a For the purposes of subsection 2d, in determining the length of the continuous period during which two people have lived together as a couple  any period of the relationship that fell before the commencement date of the Bill is to be taken into account If you have kids at some point, youd also fall under 2.2.a through 2.2.c too. After that, the financial parity decided upon by the court depends on a whole bunch of conditions as outlined in the Bill, but Section 8.1.b is pretty clear Section 8.1.b bthe court is satisfied either ithat the respondent has retained a benefit or ii40that the applicant has an economic disadvantage, as a result of qualifying contributions the applicant has made Im not qualified to say whether your partner helping to pay off your mortgage in lieu of paying rent herself would count as just paying rent or giving you an economic benefit.

As such, the preferred structure offers a flexible approach to structuring a preferred offering for an issuer. Companies have many reasons to issue preferred securities. Financial institutions, for example, need to raise capital. Many times they will use the preferred market because of any required regulatory requirements, in addition to cost considerations. Banks and financial institutions are required to maintain a certain level of Tier 1 capitalwhich includes common equity and perpetual noncumulative preferredsas protection against the banks liabilities.

    "body": "The biggest risk you have when a country defaults on its currency is a major devaluation of the currency. Since the EURO is a fiat currency, like almost all developed nations, its \"promise\" comes from the expectation that its union and system will endure. The EURO is a basket of countries and as such could probably handle bailing out countries or possibly letting some default on their sovereign debt without killing the EURO itself. A similar reality happens in the United States with some level of regularity with state and municipal debt being considered riskier than Federal debt it isnt uncommon for cities to default. The biggest reason the EURO will probably lose a LOT of value initially is if any nation defaults there isnt a track record as to how the EU member body will respond. Will some countries attempt to break out of the EU? If the member countries fracture then the EURO collapses rendering any and all EURO notes useless. It is that political stability that underlies the value of the EURO. If you are seriously concerned about the risk of a falling EURO and its long term stability then youd do best buying a hedge currency or devising a basket of hedge currencies to diversify risk. Many will recommend you buy Gold or other precious metals, but I think the idea is silly at best. It is not only hard to buy precious metals at a \"fair\" value it is even harder to sell them at a fair value. Whatever currency you hold needs to be able to be used in transactions with ease. Doesnt do you any good having 20K in gold coins and no one willing to buy them as the seller at the store will usually want currency and not gold coins. If you want to go the easy route you can follow the same line of reasoning Central Banks do. Buy USD and hold it. It is probably the worlds safest currency to hold over a long period of time. Current US policy is inflationary so that wont help you gain value, but that depends on how the EU responds to a sovereign debt crisis if one matures."

Not to mention that such discipline would come in handy in other fields as well. What other 8020 low hanging fruit knowledge have I missed? While it may not count as low hanging fruit, one thing that stands out to me is theres no mention of what competition a company has in its field.

    "body": "I used to own a few investment properties, so Im pretty familiar with this. As MrChrister mentions, lenders see investment mortgages as higher risk. People who fall into financial trouble are much more likely to let their investment properties go than their personal residence. Consequently, the interest rates and downpayment requirements are generally higher. Typically a mortgage for an investment property will require 20 down, vs. as low as 35 down for a personal residence. With excellent credit and some shopping around, you could probably do 10 down. Interest rates are typically about a halfpercent higher as well. Youll also find that the more investment properties you have, the harder it becomes to finance new ones. Banks look at debttoincome ratios to determine if you are over extended. Typically banks like to see that your housing payments are less than 20 or so of your income. However, with rental properties, housing payments generally account for far more than 20 of your rental income. Other income you have can offset that, but after buying 23 houses or so, your DTI generally creeps into the range where lenders are uncomfortable lending to you anymore. This is why youll find that many rental properties are bought on land contracts with owner financing rather than with mortgages."

At least this is what should happen, since an index is basically a sum of the market cap of the contributing companies. No, indices can have various weightings. The DJIA is a priceweighted index not marketcap weighted. An alternative weighting besides marketcap and price is equal weighting. From Dow Jones Dow Jones Industrial Average. Introduced in May 1896, the index, also referred to as The Dow, is a priceweighted measure of 30 U.S. bluechip companies. Thus, I can wonder what in the new shares makes the index go up? If a stock is split, the Dow divisor is adjusted as one could easily see how the current Dow value isnt equal to the sum or the share prices of the members of the index. In other cases, there may be a dilution of earnings but that doesnt necessarily affect the stock price directly as there may be options exercised or secondary offerings made. SO if the index, goes up, will the ETF DIA also go up automatically although no additional buying has happened in the ETF itself? If the index rises and the ETF doesnt proportionally, then there is an arbitrage opportunity for someone to buy the DIA shares that can be redeemed for the underlying stocks that are worth more in this case. Look at the Creation and Redemption Unit process that exists for ETFs."

For the specific case of Canada, the exports would become costlier, because of a costlier dollar, but at the same time imports would become cheaper. This is only a generalization, not specific goodswise, which would require a more detailed ananlysis. But investors have a different dilemma. Canadian investors would find it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in Canada. While foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in Canada and may wait for later or invest somehwre else. Then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates, if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the Canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of Canada. But what would be the final outcome of the whole rigmarole is little difficult to predict, because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do.

However, in practise, the market has many participants, and they will all be arriving at a different idea of what the \"fair price\" is by way of a slightly different analysis and slightly different information. In theory they all have the same information, but unfortunately in practise there is always some disparity. When one participant feels a stock is undervalued though the last thing they want to do is say so, instead they will start buying stock. They might feel it is undervalued by 20, but that doesnt mean theyll keep buying and buying until it gets to 20, they might push the price up just a little, then let the price drift down again, buy some more, relax, buy some more, etc. Over time the price will rise of course because the supply will become weaker, but even if the participant is correct about the 20 the price might have only risen 7 by the time they acquire all the stock they want given their risk models, market exposure and margin guidelines, etc, and it might be more than a year later before the price has actually risen to 20, presumably because more and more other market participants have come to the same conclusion. The opposite can obviously also happen, a participant might dump stock it feels is over valued long before it hits the values it believes in. So right away you can see that pricing might not really reflect value, or \"fair price\"."

    "body": "The stock market is just like any other market, but stocks are bought and sold here. Just like you buy and sell your electronics at the electronics market, this is a place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares or stocks or equity, no matter what you call it. What are these shares? A share is nothing but a portion of ownership of a company. Suppose a company has 100 shares issued to it, and you were sold 10 out of those, it literally means you are a 10 owner of the company. Why do companies sell shares? Companies sell shares to grow or expand. Suppose a business is manufacturing or producing and selling goods or services that are high in demand, the owners would want to take advantage of it and increase the production of his goods or services. And in order to increase production he would need money to buy land or equipment or labor, etc. Now either he could go get a loan by pledging something, or he could partner with someone who could give him money in exchange for some portion of the ownership of the company. This way, the owner gets the money to expand his business and make more profit, and the lender gets a portion of profit every time the company makes some. Now if the owner decides to sell shares rather than getting a loan, thats when the stock market comes into the picture. Why would a person want to trade stocks? First of all, please remember that stocks were never meant to be traded. You always invest in stocks. Whats the difference? Trading is short term and investing is long term, in very simple language. Its the greed of humans which led to this concept of trading stocks. A person should only buy stocks if he believes in the business the company is doing and sees the potential of growth. Back to the question a person would want to buy stocks of the company because How does a stock market help society? Look around you for the answer to this question. Let me give you a start and I wish everyone reading this post to add at least one point to the answer. Corporations in general allow many people come together and invest in a business without fear that their investment will cause them undue liability  because shareholders are ultimately not liable for the actions of a corporation. The cornerstone North American case of how corporations add value is by allowing many investors to have put money towards the railroads that were built across America and Canada. For The stock market in particular, by making it easier to trade shares of a company once the company sells them, the number of people able to conveniently invest grows exponentially. This means that someone can buy shares in a company without needing to knock door to door in 5 years trying to find someone to sell to. Participating in the stock market creates liquidity, which is essentially the ease with which stocks are converted into cash. High liquidity reduces risk overall, and it means that those who want risk [because high risk often creates high reward] can buy shares, and those who want low risk [because say they are retiring and dont have a risk appetite anymore] can sell shares."

    "body": "Index funds are wellknown to give the best longterm investment. Not exactly. Indexes give the best long term performance when compared to actively managing investments directly in the underlying stocks. That is, if you compare an SP500 index to trying to pick stocks that are part of it, youre more likely to succeed with blindly following the index than trying to actively beat it. That said, noone promises that investing in SP500 is better than investing in DJIA, for example. These are two different indexes tracking different stocks and areas. So when advisers say \"diversify\" they dont mean it that you should diversify between different stocks that build up the SP500 index. They mean that you should diversify your investments in different areas. Some in SP500, some in DJIA, some in international indexes, some in bond indexes, etc. Still, investing in various indexes will likely yield better results than actively managing the investments trying to beat those indexes, but you should not invest in only one, and that is the meaning of diversification. In the comments you asked \"why diversify at all?\", and that is entirely a different question from your original \"what diversification is?\". You diversify to reduce the risk of loss from one side, and widen the net for gains from another. The thing is that any single investment can eventually fail, regardless of how it performed before. You can see that the SP500 index lost 50 of its value twice within ten years, whereas before it was doubling itself every several years. Many people who were only invested in that index or whats underlying to it lost a lot of money. But consider youve diversified, and in the last 20 years youve invested in a blend of indexes that include the SP500, but also other investments like SP BSE SENSEX mentioned by Victor below. You would reduce your risk of loss on the American market by increasing your gains on the Indian market. Add to the mix soaring Chinese Real Estate market during the time of the collapse of the US realestate, gains on the dollar losing its value by investing in other currencies Canadian dollar, for example, etc. There are many risks, and by diversifying you mitigate them, and also have a chance to create other potential gains. Now, another question is why invest in indexes. That has been answered before on this site. It is my opinion that some methods of investing are just gambling by trying to catch the wave and they will almost always fail, and rarely will individual stock picking beat the market. Of course, after the fact its easy to be smart and pick the winning stocks. But the problem is to be able to predict those charts ahead of time."

According to the New York Times, \"Interest rates are usually an eighth to a halfpercentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans.\" Theyre also tougher to qualify for, and fewer lenders offer them, again due to the risk to the bank. Since you can always put extra towards the principal, strictly speaking, these are the only downsides. The upside, of course, is that you can make a lower payment each month. The question is what are you doing with this? If this is the only way you can afford the payments, theres a good chance the house is too expensive for you. Youre not building equity in the home, and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down. If youre using the money for other things, or you have variable income, it might be a different story. For the former, reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason, if youre cognizant of the risks.

So many, that even the most scientific approaches to investing can just as equally be described as an art. Im not aware of the details of your situation, but in general, for you to fully realize the benefits from applying the principals of value investing shared by Graham and more recently Warren Buffett, you must invest on the level that requires use of the consolidation or equity method of accounting, e.g.  20 ownership. Sure, the same principals used by Buffett can work on a smaller scale, but a small scale investor is best served by wealth accumulation, which can take many forms. Not the addition of instant equity via acquisitions to their consolidated financials. Lastly, to test what you have learned about value investing, and order execution, try the inverse. At least on paper. Short a stock with low value and a high PE. TWTR may be a good example? Learn what it is like to have your resources at stake, and the anguish of market and security volatility.

Youre either going to subject yourself to principal risk or lose the flexibility of withdrawing the money. A better strategy IMO is to look at your overall portfolio and what you actually want. If you have 100k in a money market, and you are not going to need 100k in cash for the forseeable future  you are \"paying\" via the low yield for flexibility that you dont need. If get your money into an appropriately diversified portfolio, youll end up with a more optimal return. If the money involved is relatively small, doing nothing is a real option as well. 5,000 at 0.5 yields 25, and a 5 return yields only 250. If you need that money soon to pay tuition, use for living expenses, etc, its not worth the trouble."

It doesnt exclude capital gains, interest, dividends, and basically everything that is not salary. You pay US taxes on it from the first cent. Foreign tax credit  foreign tax credit form 1116 doesnt reduce your US tax dollar for dollar even though it may appear that it does from the generic explanations. By using this form you may end up accumulating unused credit while still paying double taxes at the same time. Happened to me. Thank Congress for the logical and reasonable US tax laws. New FATCA form 8938 as opposed to FBAR that goes to the FinCEN in the Treasury, this one goes to the IRS. it contains very similar info, but the threshold requirements are different. You may have to file FBAR, but not these, or you may have to file both. Being an American citizen, some European banks will refuse to provide services to you. Again, thank Congress for FATCA. It requires foreign banks to enforce US tax regulations on US citizens, and banks that wont will get penalized in the US. Many banks refuse to provide services to Americans because of that because what IRS requires is illegal in most countries. Some countries like UK and some other EU countries have signed treaties with the US to resolve this, but many havent. Currency conversion  as I commented to Paul, you convert the amounts when you receive them, which may have your fixed EUR salary be converted to different dollar amounts every time. You need to make sure you do it right. Pensions, savings, investments  if youre doing these in nonUS instruments prepare to be penalized. US taxes foreign investments much more aggressively than domestic. If youre investing in indexesmutual funds, or youre a principle in a corporation, or you create a pension account  youll get hit by additional reporting requirements and tax. Tax treaties  the US has tax treaties with many EU countries, and equalization treaties with some. The tax treaties affect the standard tax treatment by the US and some of the \"generic\" info you got here may not apply because of a tax treaty, and some other rules may apply. Equalization treaties work similarly with regards to the Social Security. Bottom line, and I know Paul disagrees with me on this  talk with a USlicensed adviser in the country youre going to. It is very important for your tax adviser to know the relevant treaty and not read it the first time when you call him, and to understand each and every financial instrument in your country. Missing piece of paper in your tax return can cost you thousands of dollars in penalties not exaggerating, not filing form 3520 triggers a 10000 penalty, even if theres no tax and additional taxes."

Credit history length is a huge factor, so in the first year expect that nobody would trust you and you may be refused credit or asked for deposits. I was asked for deposits at cell phone company and refused for store cards couple of times. My advice  get a secured credit card that means you put certain sum of money as a deposit in the bank and you get credit equal to that sum of money and if you have something like a car loan that helps too of course, you shouldnt buy a car just for that  but if youre buying anyway, just know its not only hurting but also helping when you pay. Once you have a year or two of the history and youve kept with all the payments, you credit score would be OK and everybody would be happy to work with you. In 45 years you can have excellent credit record if you pay on time and dont do anything bad. If you are working it the US, a lot of help at first would be to take a letter from your company on an official letterhead saying that you are employed by this and that company and are getting salary of this and that. That can serve as an assurance for some merchants that otherwise would be reluctant to work with you because of the absence of credit history. If you have any assets overseas, especially if they are held in a branch of international bank in US dollars, that could help too. In general, dont count too much on credit for first 12 years though youd probably could get a car loan, for example, but rates would be exorbitant  easily 10 percentage points higher than with good credit, but it will get better soon."

    "body": "People treat an emergency fund as some kind of aceinthehole when it comes to financial difficulty, but it is only one of many sources of money that you can utilize. What is an emergency? First, you have to define what an emergency is. Is it a lost job? Is it an unplanned event pregnancy, perhaps? Is it a medical emergency? Is it the death of you or your spouse? Also, what does it mean to be unplanned? Is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2week notice an emergency? Is one month of planning an emergency? Two? Only you can answer these questions for yourself, but they significantly shape your financial strategy. Planning is highly dependent on your cashflow, and, for some people, it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work. For others, they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month. Also, you have to consider the length of the emergency. Jobloss is rarely permanent, but its rarely short as well. The current average is 30.7 weeks thats 7 months! Money in an Emergency There are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency A good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account. Some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other. However, some of these are correlated. For example, in 2008, three things happened the stock market crashed, unsecured debt dried up, and people faced financial emergency lost jobs, cut wages. If you were dependent on a stock portfolio andor a line of credit, youd be up a creek, because the value of your investments suddenly decreased, and you cant really tap your now significantly limited line of credit. However, if you had a one or more of cash savings, unemployment income, and unemployment insurance, you would probably have been OK. Budgeting for an emergency When you say \"financial emergency\", most people think job loss. However, the most common cause of bankruptcy in the US is medical debt. Depending on your insurance situation, this could be a serious risk, or it may not be. People say you should have 3x6x of your monthly income in savings because its an easy, backoftheenvelope way to handle most financial emergency risk, but its not necessarily the most prudent strategy for you. To properly budget for an emergency, you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face, and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency. Generally, having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a riskmitigation strategy. But its not a panacea for every kind of emergency."

There is absolutely no requirement that one of them didnt offer too much or demand too little, so this is nearly meaningless as an indication of what anyone else will be willing to offer or demand. An average of trades across a sufficiently large number of transactions might indicate a rough consensus about the value of a stock, but transactions will be clustered around that average and the average itself moves over time. Either you offer to sell or buy at a particular price, wait for that price, and risk the transaction not taking place at all if nobody agrees, or you do a spot transaction and get the best price at that nanosecond which may not be the best in the next nanosecond. Or you tell the broker what the limits are that you consider acceptable, trading these risks off against each other.

Of course, if your fund or stock is up, you are likely better off, paying the 1250 tax on the 5000 conversion thats now worth 6000 or more. If its down, you can recharacterize. The volatility of the market helps makes this process more attractive. If my converted shares dropped quite a bit, the recharacterization is far more desirable than a small drop or no drop at all.

Here are some of those things I could go on but I wont. 95K is good money and I would definitely recommend spending it a bit to enjoy yourself. But I would honestly tell you that taking your monthly expenses, adding a few hundred on top of that and then multiplying that sum by 3 would be a smart savings amount before picking up a car loan.

So instead of having to deal with the stab at your pride when having to lower the costquality of living that youll probably grow accustomed to at a 95K salary, just prepare for the worst.

You probably know couples, that are in some part of the divorce process, that have trouble obtaining court ordered payments. In your case you have less of a legal standing exception if you have children together. As far as the house goes, the two of you entered into some sort of business arrangement and it will be difficult to \"force\" him to pay. One thing that works for you is that he has excellent credit. If he is interested in keeping a high credit rating he will ensure that no payments are late on the home. Your question suggests that the two of you are not getting along very well right now, and that needs to stop. The best financial decision you can make right now is to get along with him. It seems that the two of you have not officially broken up. If you do decide to depart ways, do so as amicably as possible. You will have to work to get the home in your name only, and him off the deed. This benefits both of you as you will have sole control of the house and this ill advised business decision can end. He will have the home off his credit and will not be responsible if you miss a payment and can also buy a home or whatever of his own. Good luck and do your best to work this out. Seeking peace will cost you a lot less money in the long run. Fighting in court cost a lot of money. Giving in to semireasonable demands are far cheaper then fighting. Here is an example. Lets say he normally contributes 500 to the mortgage, and he decides to move out. I would ask him to contribute 200 until you can get his name off the loan, say 6 months at the most.

Heres the reason To buy goods of a certain country, you have to exchange your money for currency of that country, especially when you want to buy treasuries of stocks from that country. So, if you feel that, for example, Japanese stocks are going to pick up soon, you will exchange dollars for yen so you can buy Japanese stocks. By the laws of supply and demand, this drives up the price. In contrast, if investors lose faith in a country and withdraw their funds, they will seek their luck elsewhere and thus they increase the supply of that currency.

Lets look at this simplified example The bank creates an asset  loan in the amount of X, secured by a house worth 1.25X assuming 20 downpayment. The bank also creates a liability in the amount of X to its depositors, because the money lent was the money first deposited into the bank by someone else or borrowed by the bank from the Federal Reserve, which is, again, a liability. That liability is not secured. Now the person defaults on the loan in the amount of X, but at that time the prices dropped, and the house is now worth 0.8X. The bank forecloses, sells the house, recovers 80 of the loan, and removes the asset of the loan, creating an asset of cash in the value of 0.8X. But the liability in the amount of X didnt go anywhere. Bank still has to repay the X amount of money back to its depositorsFeds. The difference? 20 of X in our scenario  thats the banks loss.

No, repayment of the loan is not taxable income. Interest on it is. Do you have to pay taxes if you are paid back in a different format than originally paid? Form of payment doesnt matter. Barter trade doesnt affect the tax liability. The friend sold you lunches and you paid for them. The friend can deduct the cost of the lunches from the proceeds. Whats left  is taxable income. Everything is translated to the functional currency at the fair market value at the time of the trade. you are required to pay taxes on the gross amount Very rarely taxes apply to gross income. Definitely not the US Federal Income taxes for individuals. An example of an exception would be the California LLC taxes. The State of California taxes LLCs under its jurisdiction on gross proceeds, regardless of the actual net income. This is very uncommon. However, the IRC the US Federal Tax Code is basically \"everything is taxable except whats not\", and the cost of generating income is one of the \"whats not\". That is why you can deduct the basis of the asset from your gross proceeds when you sell stuff and only pay taxes on the net difference."

Find the performance of each stock in that list over whatever time period you want to use for your experiment. Now select some number of the bestperforming stocks from the list  any number less than 500. By definition, the X best must be better than or equal to the average. Assuming all the stocks on the SP did not have EXACTLY the same performance, these 10 must be better than average. You now have a diversified portfolio that performed better than the SP 500 index fund. Of course as they always say in a prospectus, past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. Its certainly possible to do. The question is, if YOU selected the stocks making up a diversified portfolio, would your selections do better than an index fund?"

If the net longterm capital gain is more than the net shortterm capital loss, the taxpayer has a net capital gain. So your net longterm gains from all investments, through all brokers are offset by any net shortterm loss. Short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate. Im trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain, but at the same time trade the stock. If you close in the next year, one of two things will happen  either the stock will go down, and youll have shortterm gains on the short, or the stock will go up, and youll have shortterm losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock.

    "body": "There are some economic signs as there are in all economic and business cycles, such as interest rates rising. However, a more effective way is to actually look at price action itself. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs followed by higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows followed by lower highs. So if you are looking to invest for the long term you can look at the weekly or even the monthly chart of the market say over the past 10, 15 or 20 years. Using these definitions on say the SP500 if the price continues to make higher highs and higher lows then stay in the market. If the price makes a lower high than the previous high, then this is a warning sign that the trend may be about to end. The trend has not broken yet but it is a warning sign that it could be ending soon. If the price makes a higher low next followed by a higher high, then the trend continues and you just need to keep an eye on things. If, however, the price makes a lower low after the lower high this is a signal that the uptrend is over and you should get out of the market. If the price makes a lower low directly after a higher high, then be cautious and wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over. If you then get a lower high this is confirmation that the uptrend is over, you would then sell if prices drop below the previous low. If you invest in individual shares then you should keep an eye on the charts for the index and individual shares as well. The index chart will give you an indication if the uptrend is over for the whole market, then you can be more cautious in regards to the individual shares. You can then plan exit points on each individual share if their trends are broken too. If you have stop losses employed and the trend reverses on the index, this would be a good time to tighten your stop losses on individual shares. You can then buy back into the market when you determine that the downtrend is broken and prices start to show higher highs and higher lows again. Will there be occasions when the uptrend reverses and then after a short period starts trending up again, yes there might be, but the worse that will happen is that you pay a bit of extra brokerage to get out and then back into the market, and you might have to pay some capital gains tax on any profits made. But remember no one ever went broke making a profit. The most important thing to remember when investing is to conserve and protect your capital. I would rather pay some extra brokerage and some capital gains tax than see my portfolio drop by 50 or more, then take 5 years or more to recover. And remember, paying tax is a good thing, it means you made money. If you dont want to pay any tax it means you will never make any profits, because if you make profits you will have to pay tax one day."

For a reasonably liquid stock, there will be several buy orders in line, and the highest bid must be filled first, so there should a very short time between when you place the order and when it is filled.

Thats when the broker places their own order in front of yours to fulfill the current bid, selling their own stock at the slightly higher price, causing your sale to be filled at a lower price. This is not only unethical but illegal as well. It is not something you should be concerned about with a large broker. You should only place a market order when you dont care about minute differences between the current ask and your execution price, but want to guarantee order execution. If you absolutely have to sell at a minimum price, then a limit order is more appropriate, but you run the risk that your limit will not be reached and your order will not be filled.

I actually know of one case where the executor a family member, not a professional distributed the inheritance before paying the estate taxes. Long story short, the heirs had to pay back part of the inheritance. So the first thing that I would do is verify that the estate is closed and all the taxes paid. If the executor is a professional, just call and ask. If a family member, you may want to approach it more obliquely. Or not. The important thing is not to start spending that money until youre sure that you have it. One good thing is that my husband is in grad school and will be done in 2019 and will then make about 75Kyr with his degree profession. Be a bit careful about relying on this. Outside the student loans, you should build other expenses around the assumption that he wont find a job immediately after grad school. For example, we could be in a recession in 2019. Well be about due by then. Paying off the 5k \"other debt\" is probably a no brainer. Chances are that youre paying doubledigit interest. Just kill it. Unless the car loan is zerointerest, you probably want to get rid of that loan too. I would tend to agree that the car seems expensive for your income, but Im not sure that the amount that you could recover by selling it justifies the loss of value. Hopefully its in good shape and will last for years without significant maintenance. Consider putting 2k your monthly income in your checking account. Instead of paying for things paychecktopaycheck, this should allow you to buy things on schedule, without having to wait for the money to appear in your account. Put the remainder into an emergency account. Set aside 12k 50 of your annual incomeexpenses for real emergencies like a medical emergency or job loss. The other 16k you can use the same way you use the 5k other debt borrowing now, for small emergencies. E.g. a car repair. Make a budget and stick to it. The elimination of the car loan should free up enough monthly income to support a reasonable budget. If it seems like it isnt, then you are spending too much money for your income. Dont forget to explicitly budget for entertainment and vacations. Its easy to overspend there. If you dont make a budget, youll just find yourself back to your paychecktopaycheck existence. That sounds like it is frustrating for you. Budget so that you know how much money you really need to live."

Low volume shares will have larger bidoffer spreads than high volume shares, so if you need to get out of position quickly you will be at risk of being forced to take a lowball offer. Having said that, it is important to understand that high yielding shares have high yields for a reason. Namely, the market does not think much of the companys prospects and that it is likely that a cut in the dividend is coming in the near future. In general, the nominal price of a share is not important. If two companies have equal prospect, then the percentage movement in their share price will be about the same, so the net profit or loss you realise will be about the same."

Now oil is less, maybe 40 per the link. These exploration companies dont have a lot of labor or variable costs they are operationally profitable, may have \"use it or lose it\" leases or minimum pumping requirements for contract or engineering reasons. Lets say the cash flow is 7M so the market values them at 70M. They still have about 100M book value so here we are at .7 and I believe the scenario in the question. Nobody would invest in new capacity at this oil price. The well equipment could be repurposed but not the borehole or lease, so the best use is to continue pumping and value it on cash flow. If an individual well runs negative long enough and goes bust, either a different pumper will pay the minimum price that gives profitable cash flow, or that borehole that cost millions to dig is shut off and rendered valueless. The CNBC article says some explorers are playing games with debt to maintain yield, so there is that too. In the ETF, your bet is that the market is wrong and oil will go up, increasing future cash flows or you like the current yield, taking on the risk that some of these oil explorers could go bust."

Under certain conditions the small caps will outperform the SP, definitely. However, under other conditioned, such as global growth slowdown, they are typically the first to fall. Based on your comments, like how you mentioned you dont want to sell, I think index funds should make up a decent size portion of your portfolio.

You also need to look at the fixed rates for different periods, for example 1 year fixed compared to 3 year fixed and 5 year fixed rates. If you find the 3 and 5 year fixed rates are higher than the 1 year fixed rates this could be an indication that the banks feel rates will fall in the short term but the falls wont last long and will continue to rise after a year or so. If the 3 year fixed rates are also low in comparison, then the banks may feel that the economy is heading for a longer term down trend. The banks wont want to lose out, so will change their fixed rates on their perception of where they feel the economy is headed. Since your post in May 2011, the standard variable rate has since dropped twice in November and December to be at 7.30. You will also find that fixed rates have also been dropped further by the banks, indicating additional future cuts in the variable rates. Regards, Victor"

    "body": "FHA insured loans must go hand in hand with PMI, because the FHA element is the insurance itself. The FHA isnt actually giving you a loan, thats coming from a lender instead, the FHA is insuring the loan, at some cost to you  but allowing a loan to folks who may not be able to afford it normally lower down payment requirements and a somewhat cheaper PMI. FHAinsured loans may be lower rates in some cases than nonFHA insured loans because of this backing thats because they make it easier for people of poorer credit histories with smaller down payments to get a house in the first place. Those people would tend to have a harder time getting a loan, and be charged sometimes usurious rates to get it. Low down payment and mediocre credit history think 580620 mean higher risk, even beyond the risk directly coming from the poor loan to value ratio. Comparing this table of Freddie Mac rates to this table of FHAbacked loan rates, the loan rates seem comparable though somewhat lagging in changes in some cases. FHA loans are not nearly the size or complexity of loan population as Freddie Mac, so be wary of making direct comparisons. Looking into this in more detail, precollapse before 1207, FHA rates were a bit lower  average rate was about .5 points lower  but starting with 1207, FHA average rates were usually higher than Freddie Mac rates for 30 year fixed loans in 12009 for example they were almost a point higher. As of the last data I see 513 the rates were within 0.1 points most months. This may be in part because Freddie Mac had looser requirements to get a loan precollapse, then tightened significantly, then started to loosen some also around June 2013, rates climbed significantly due to some signals from the Fed, although theyre almost back to their lows thanks to the Fed again. These are averages across all loans, so you get some noise as a result. Loan interest rates are very personal, in general they depend on your credit, your house and down payment, and your bank which varies by your location. The best thing to do is to shop around yourself and just see what you get, and ask your lender any questions you have if you pick a local lender with a good service history and who is willing to talk to you in person ie, has a direct phone number, youll have no trouble getting answers."

This is the main source for the delays in international payments  there are thousands of banks, and most of possible pairs have no legal contact between themselves whatsoever, no bilateral agreements, no trust and no reasonable enforcement mechanism for small claims. If Im Bobs bank, then a random bank from anywhere from Switzerland to Nigeria can send me an instruction \"give Bob 1, well make it up for you\", the SWIFT network is a common way of doing this. However, most likely Im going to give Bob the money only after I receive the funds somehow, which means that they have given the money to some institution I work with. For payments within a single country, it often is a centralized exchange or a central bank, and the payment speed is then determined by the details of that particular single payment network  e.g. UK Faster Payments or the various systems used in USA. For international payments, it may require a chain of multiple intermediaries correspondent banks  for example, a payment of 1mm from Kazakhstan to China will likely involve the Kazakhstan bank asking their main correspondent in USA some major bank such as Chase JPMorgan to give the money to the relevant chinese banks correspondent in USA say, Citi to then give the money to that chinese bank to then give the money to the actual recipient. Each of those steps can happen because those entities have bilateral agreements, trust and accounts with each other and each of those steps generally takes time and verification. If you want all payments to happen instantly, then you need all institutions to join a single binding payment system. Its not as easy as it sounds, as it is a nightmare of jurisdiction  for example, if youd want me as Bobs bank to credit Bob instantly, then the system needs to provide solid guarantees that I would get paid even if a the payer institution changes its mind, made a mistake or intentional fraud b the payer institution goes insolvent c the system provider gets insolvent. Providing such guarantees is expensive, they need to be backed by multibillion capital, and theyre unrealistic to enforce across jurisdictions e.g. would an Iranian bank get recourse if some funds got blocked because of USA sanctions. The biggest such project as far as I know is SEPA, across most of Europe. Visa and MasterCard networks perform the same function  a merchant gets paid by the CC network even if the payer cant pay his CC bill or the paying bank goes insolvent."

    "body": "If you have money and may need to access it at any time, you should put it in a savings account. It wont return much interest, but it will return some and it is easily accessible. If you have all your emergency savings that you need at least six months of income, buy indexbased mutual funds. These should invest in a broad range of securities including both stocks and bonds three dollars in stocks for every dollar in bonds so as to be robust in the face of market shifts. You should not buy individual stocks unless you have enough money to buy a lot of them in different industries. Thirty different stocks is a minimum for a diversified portfolio, and you really should be looking at more like a hundred. Theres also considerable research effort required to verify that the stocks are good buys. For most people, this is too much work. For most people, broadbased index funds are better purchases. You dont have as much upside, but you also are much less likely to find yourself holding worthless paper. If you do buy stocks, look for ones where you know something about them. For example, if youve been to a restaurant chain with a recent IPO that really wowed you with their food and service, consider investing. But do your research, so that you dont get caught buying after everyone else has already overbid the price. The time to buy is right before everyone else notices how great they are, not after. Some people benefit from joining investment clubs with others with similar incomes and goals. That way you can share some of the research duties. Also, you can get other opinions before buying, which can restrain risky impulse buys. Just to reiterate, I would recommend sticking to mutual funds and saving accounts for most investors. Only make the move into individual stocks if youre willing to be serious about it. Theres considerable work involved. And dont forget diversification. You want to have stocks that benefit regardless of what the overall economy does. Some stocks should benefit from lower oil prices while others benefit from higher prices. You want to have both types so as not to be caught flatfooted when prices move. There are much more experienced people trying to guess market directions. If your strategy relies on outperforming them, it has a high chance of failure. Indexbased mutual funds allow you to share the diversification burden with others. Since the market almost always goes up in the long term, a fund that mimics the market is much safer than any individual security can be. Maintaining a three to one balance in stocks to bonds also helps as they tend to move in opposite directions. I.e. stocks tend to be good when bonds are weak and vice versa."

If you buy silver at an entrustment price above market price, say x when the market offer is m, then parts of your order will likely be filled at the market price. For the remaining quantity there is now a limit, the bankbroker might fill your order over the next 5 days or however long the validity is at various prices, such that the overall average price does not exceed x. This is different to a limit order, as it allows the bankbroker to partially buy silver at higher prices than x as long as the overall averages is x or less. In a limit setup you might be partially filled at market prices first, but if the market moves above x the bankbroker will not fill any remaining quantities of your order, so you might end up after a day or 5 days with a partially filled order. Also note that an entrustment price below the market price and with a short enough validity behaves like a limit price. The 4th order type is sort of an oppositeside limit price A stopbuy means buy when the market offer quote goes above a certain price, a stopsell means sell when the market bid quote goes below a certain price. Paired with the entrusment principle, this might mean that you buysell on average abovebelow the price you give.

Its pretty good, and importantly, the market relies on it to determine fair option pricing. Option prices are determined by Relationship of stock price to strike. Both distance and \"moneyness\". Time to expiration. Dividends. Since dividend payments reduce the intrinsic value of a company, the prospect of dividend payments during the life of a call option depresses the price of the option, as all else equal, without the payments, the stock would be more likely to end up in the money. Reverse the logic for puts. Volatility. Interest rates. But this effect is so tiny, its safe to ignore. 4, Volatility, is the biggie. Everything else is known. Thats why option trading is often considered \"volatility trading\". There are many ways to skin this cat, but the result is that by using quoted historical values for the stock price, and the dividend payments, and if you like, interest rates, you can very closely determine what the price of the option would have been. \"Very closely\" depending on your volatility assumption. You could calculate thenhistorical volatility for each time period, by figuring the average price swing in either direction for say the past year year before the date in question, so youd do this each day, walking forward.

The game, called Cash WinFall, had a quirk in the rules the jackpot prize was capped at 2 million. Any money in the jackpot beyond 2 million would increase the payout of the consolation prizes. Thus, the game would sometimes have a positive expected value. The return on investment was 15 to 20  enough for the participants to quit their jobs. This specific loophole is no longer available a cap was placed on the number of tickets sold per store, then the game was discontinued altogether.

    "body": "If you buy a call, thats because you expect that the stock will go up. If it does not go up, then forget about buying more calls as your initial idea seems to be wrong. And I dont think that buying a put to make up for the loss will work either, the only thing that is sure is that you will pay another premium on a stock that could stay where it is. Even if you are 100 sure that the stock will go up again, dont do anything, as John Maynard Keynes stated \"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent\". My idea is wait until the expiration date. The good things about options is that you wont lose more than the premium that you paid for it and that until it reaches its maturity you can still make money if the market turns around. More generally, when you are purely speculating, adding to a position when it goes against you is called \"averaging down\". I sincerely discourage you to do that  If the stocks goes in the wrong direction, that means that your initial idea was wrong in the first place or you were not right at the right moment. In my opinion, adding up to a wrong idea is not the right thing to do. When you are losing, just take your loss and dont add up to your position based on your emotions. On the other hand, adding to your position more when the stock goes in your direction is called \"pyramiding\" and is, in my opinion, a better way of doing things you bought, you were right, lets buy more. But at some point you will have to take your profits. There are plenty of other stocks on which you can try to invest and the market will still be here tomorrow, there will be other opportunities to make profits. Rushing things by constantly trying to have a position is not a good idea. Not doing anything is also a strategy."

That is if the market is very volatile on a given day, so that the stock hits 13 in the morning, the put gets exercised, and then hits 15 later in the day, so the call gets exercised. Or vice versa. More to the point, the prices are close enough that one might be hit on one day, and the other on a DIFFERENT day. In either case, if one side gets hit, you need to reevaluate your position in the other. But basically, any open position you have can be hit at any time.

    "header": "Evidence ForAgainst Real Estate Investing Visavis Investing in ETFs",
    "body": "Real Estate potentially has two components of profit, the increase in value, and the ongoing returns, similar to a stock appreciating and its dividends. Its possible to buy both badly, and in the case of stocks, there are studies that show the typical investor lags the market by many percent. Real estate is not a homogeneous asset class. A 200K house renting for 1,000 is a far different investment than a 100K 3 family renting for 2,000 total rents. Both exist depending on the part of the country you are in. If you simply divide the price to the rent you get either 16.7X or 4.2X. This is an oversimplification, and of course, interest rates will push these numbers in one direction or another. Its safe to say that at any given time, the ratio can help determine if home prices are too high, a bargain, or somewhere in between. As one article suggests, the median price tracks inflation pretty closely. And Id add, that median home prices would track median income long term. To circle back, yes, real estate can be a good investment if you buy right, find good tenants, and are willing to put in the time. Note Buying to rent and buying to live in are not always the same economic decision. The home buyer will very often buy a larger house than they should, and turn their own profit into a loss. e.g. A buyer who would otherwise be advised to buy the 150K house instead of renting is talked into a bigger house by the real estate agent, the bank, the spouse. The extra cost of the 225K house is the 13 more cost of repair, utilities, interest, etc. Its identical to needing a 1000 sq ft apartment, but grabbing one thats 1500 sq ft for the view."

Are there particular assets that are causing these two banks to be valued lower relative to their book values than the other banks? There no particular assets. Given the current economic situation most Banks are not making good returns, i.e. expected returns of markets are around 1012 and the returns getting generated are around 46. The overall slow down in various segments as well as regulations in most countries mean that banks have to relook at the business model in short term and generate more revenue. The market believes that Banks may loose money faster and hence the negative outlook and the trading below the book value. Note Book Value is derived in ideal conditions, i.e. when the company is healthy. If any company were to sell the assets in distress, the actual funds raised would be quite a bit less than Book Value. Its also to be noted that typically Banks would not close out and hence Book Value to an extent is just an indicator. Or is it a residual loathing based on their being the biggest losers of 2008 that are still around today? The 2008 has gone past. This is more recent.

    "header": "What is the best asset allocation for a retirement portfolio, and why?",
    "body": "This turned out be a lot longer than I expected. So, heres the overview. Despite the presence of asset allocation calculators and what not, this is a subjective matter. Only you know how much risk you are willing to take. You seem to be aware of one rule of thumb, namely that with a longer investing horizon you can stand to take on more risk. However, how much risk you should take is subject to your own risk aversion. Honestly, the best way to answer your questions is to educate yourself about the individual topics. There are just too many variables to provide neat, concise answers to such a broad question. There are no easy ways around this. You should not blindly rely on the opinions of others, but rather use your own judgment to asses their advice. Some of the links I provide in the main text SP 500 Total and InflationAdjusted Historical Returns 10year index fund returns The Motley Fool Risk aversion Disclaimer These are the opinions of an enthusiastic amateur. Why should I invest 20 in domestic large cap and 10 in developing markets instead of 10 in domestic large cap and 20 in developing markets? Should I invest in REITs? Why or why not? Simply put, developing markets are very risky. Even if you have a long investment horizon, you should pace yourself and not take on too much risk. How much is \"too much\" is ultimately subjective. Specific to why 10 in developing vs 20 in large cap, it is probably because 10 seems like a reasonable amount of your total portfolio to gamble. Another way to look at this is to consider that 10 as gone, because it is invested in very risky markets. So, if youre willing to take a 20 haircut, then by all means do that. However, realize that you may be throwing 15 of your money out the window. Meanwhile, REITs can be quite risky as investing in the real estate market itself can be quite risky. One reason is that the assets are very much fixed in place and thus can not be liquidated in the same way as other assets. Thus, you are subject to the vicissitudes of a relatively small market. Another issue is the large capital outlays required for most commercial building projects, thus typically requiring quite a bit of credit and risk. Another way to put it Donald Trump made his name in real estate, but it was and still is a very bumpy ride. Yet another way to put it you have to build it before they will come and there is no guarantee that they will like what you built. What mutual funds or index funds should I investigate to implement these strategies? I would generally avoid actively managed mutual funds, due to the expenses. They can seriously eat into the returns. There is a reason that the most mutual funds compare themselves to the Lipper average instead of something like the SP 500. All of those costs involved in managing a mutual fund teams of people and trading costs tend to weigh down on them quite heavily. As the Motley Fool expounded on years ago, if you can not do better than the SP 500, you should save yourself the headaches and simply invest in an SP 500 index fund. That said, depending on your skill and luck picking stocks or even funds, you may very well have been able to beat the SP 500 over the past 10 years. Of course, you may have also done a whole lot worse. This article discusses the performance of the SP 500 over the past 60 years. As you can see, the past 10 years have been a very bumpy ride yielding in a negative return. Again, keep in mind that you could have done much worse with other investments. That site, Simple Stock Investing may be a good place to start educating yourself. I am not familiar with the site, so do not take this as an endorsement. A quick onceover of the material on the site leads me to believe that it may provide a good bit of information in readily digestible forms. The Motley Fool was a favorite site of mine in the past for the individual investor. However, they seem to have turned to the dark side, charging for much of their advice. That said, it may still be a good place to get started. You may also decide that it is worth paying for their advice. This blog post, though dated, compares some Vanguard index funds and is a light introduction into the contrarian view of investing. Simply put, this view holds that one should not be a lemming following the crowd, rather one should do the opposite of what everyone else is doing. One strong argument in favor of this view is the fact that as more people pile onto an investing strategy or into a particular market, the yields thin out and the risk of a correction i.e. a downturn increases. In the worst case, this leads to a bubble, which corrects itself suddenly or \"pops\" thus the term \"bubble\" leading to quite a bit of pain for the unprepared participants. An unprepared participant is one who is not hedged properly. Basically, this means they were not invested in other marketsstrategies that would increase in yield as a result of the event that caused the bubble to pop. Note that the recent housing bubble and resulting credit crunch beat quite heavily on the both the stock and bond markets. So, the easy hedge for stocks being bonds did not necessarily work out so well. This makes sense, as the housing bubble burst due to concerns over easy credit. Unfortunately, I dont have any good resources on hand that may provide starting points or discuss the various investing strategies. I must admit that I am turning my interests back to investing after a hiatus. As I stated, I used to really like the Motley Fool, but now I am somewhat suspicious of them. The main reason is the fact that as they were exploring alternatives to advertising driven revenue for their site, they promised to always have free resources available for those unwilling to pay for their advice. A cursory review of their site does show a decent amount of general investing information, so take these words with a grain of salt. Another reason I am suspicious of them is the fact that they \"spammed\" me with lots of enticements to pay for their advice which seemed just like the type of advice they spoke against. Anyway, time to put the soapbox away. As I do that though, I should explain the reason for this soapboxing. Simply put, investing is a risky endeavor, any way you slice it. You can never eliminate risk, you can only hope to reduce it to an acceptable level. What is acceptable is subject to your situation and to the magnitude of your risk aversion. Ultimately, it is rather subjective and you should not blindly follow someone elses opinion professional or otherwise. Point being, use your judgment to evaluate anything you read about investing. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If someone purports to have some strategy for guaranteed steady returns, be very suspicious of it. Read up on the Bernard Madoff scandal. If someone is putting on a heavy sales pitch, be weary. Be especially suspicious of anyone asking you to pay for their advice before giving you any solid understanding of their strategy. Sure, many people want to get paid for their advice in some way in fact, I am getting \"paid\" with reputation on this site. However, if they take the sketchy approach of a slimy salesmen, they are likely making more money from selling their strategy, than they are from the advice itself. Most likely, if they were getting outsized returns from their strategy they would keep quiet about it and continue using it themselves. As stated before, the more people pile onto a strategy, the smaller the returns. The typical model for selling is to make money from the sale. When the item being sold is an intangible good, your risk as a buyer increases. You may wonder why I have written at length without much discussion of asset allocation. One reason is that I am still a relative neophyte and have a mostly high level understanding of the various strategies. While I feel confident enough in my understanding for my own purposes, I do not necessarily feel confident creating an asset allocation strategy for someone else. The more important reason is that this is a subjective matter with a lot of variables to consider. If you want a quick and simple answer, I am afraid you will be disappointed. The best approach is to educate yourself and make these decisions for yourself. Hence, my attempt to educate you as best as I can at this point in time. Personally, I suggest you do what I did. Start reading the Wall Street Journal every day. An acceptable substitute may be the business section of the New York Times. At first you will be overwhelmed with information, but in the long run it will pay off. Another good piece of advice is to be patient and not rush into investing. If you are in a hurry to determine how you should invest in a 401k or other such investment vehicle due to a desire to take advantage of an employers matching funds, then I would place my money in an SP 500 index fund. I would also explore placing some of that money into broad index funds from other regions of the globe. The reason for broad index funds is to provide some protection from the normal fluctuations and to reduce the risk of a sudden downturn causing you a lot pain while you determine the best approach for yourself. In this scenario, think more about capital preservation and hedging against inflation then about \"beating\" the market."

    "body": "The scenario you mention regarding capital gains is pretty much the core of the issue. Heres a rundown from PolitiFact.com that explains it a bit. Its important to focus on it being the tax rate, not the tax amount which I think you get, but I want to reinforce that for other readers. Basically, most of Buffetts income comes from capital gains and dividends, income from investments he makes with the money he already has. Income earned by buying and selling stocks or from stock dividends is generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for longterm capital gains and qualified dividends. Buffett also mentioned that some of the \"megarich\" are hedge fund managers \"who earn billions from our daily labors but are allowed to classify our income as carried interest, thereby getting a bargain 15 percent tax rate.\" We dont know the taxes paid by Buffetts secretary, who was mentioned by Obama but not by Buffett. Buffets secretary would have to make a high salary, or else typical deductions such as the child tax credit would offset taxes owed. Lets say the secretary is a particularly wellcompensated executive assistant, making adjusted income more than 83,600 in income. Yes, that sounds like a lot to us, too, but remember Were talking about the secretary to one of the richest people in the world. In that case, marginal tax rates of 28 percent would apply. Then, there would be payroll taxes of 6.25 percent on the first 106,800, money that goes to Social Security, and another 1.45 percent on all income, which goes to Medicare. The secretarys overall tax rate would be lower than 28 percent, since not all the income would be taxed at that rate, only the income above 83,600. Buffett, meanwhile, would pay very little, if anything, in payroll taxes. In the New York Times oped, Buffett said he paid 17.4 percent in taxes. Thinking of the secretary, it gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between 100,000 and 200,000 are paying around 20 percent in federal taxes, including payroll and income taxes, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. So in this case, the secretarys rate is higher because so much of Buffetts income comes from investments and is taxed at the lower capital gains rate. Heres Buffets original OpEd in the NYT for those of you that arent familiar."

    "body": "This is a gross simplification as there are a few different ways to do this. The principle overall is the same though. To short a stock, you borrow X shares from a third party and sell them at the current price. You now owe the lender X shares but have the proceeds from the sale. If the share price falls you can buy back those shares at the new lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference. The risk comes when the share price goes the other way, you now owe the lender the new value of the shares, so have to find some way to cover the difference.

It does not show many important factors the riskiness of the company business, its financial position, profitability, ability to generate cash.

Following any spike, not just sentiment related spikes, the market tends to bounce back to about where it had been previously as analysts at the investment banks start to see the stocks as being overbought or oversold. This is because the effect of a spike on underlying ratios such as the Sharpe ratio or the PE ratio makes the stock look less attractive to buyers and more attractive to sellers, including short sellers. Note, however, that the price is broadly still a little higher than it was before the spike as a result of this change in sentiment. Looking at the price trends on Bloomberg httpswww.bloomberg.comquoteCDNAUS the price had been steadily falling for the year prior to the spike but was levelling out at just over 1 in the few months immediately prior to the spike. The increased interest in the sector and the stock likely added to a general change in the direction of the price trend and caused traders as opposed to investors to believe that there was a change in the price trend. This will have lead to them trading the stock more heavily intraday exacerbating the spike. Note that there traders will include HFT bots as well as human traders. You question the legality of this volume increase but the simple answer is that we may never know if it was the target of traders manipulating the price or a case of insider trading. What we can see is that taking \"animal spirits\" into account without any evidence of illegality there are plenty of potential reasons why the spike may have occurred. Spikes are common where traders perceive a change in a trend as they rush to cash in on the change before other traders can and then sell out quickly when they realise that the price is fundamentally out of sync with the firms underlying position. You yourself say that you have been watching the stock for some time and, by that fact alone, it is likely that others are for the same reasons that you are. Otherwise you wouldnt be looking at it.

    "body": "You seem to be assuming that ETFs must all work like the more traditional closedend funds, where the market price per share tendsbased on supply and demandto significantly deviate from the underlying net asset value per share. The assumption is simplistic. What are traditionally referred to as closedend funds CEFs, where unit creation and redemption are very tightly controlled, have been around for a long time, and yes, they do often trade at a premium or discount to NAV because the quantity is inflexible. Yet, what is generally meant when the label \"ETF\" is used despite CEFs also being both \"exchangetraded\" and \"funds\" are those securities which are not just exchangetraded, and funds, but also typically have two specific characteristics a that they are based on some published index, and b that a mechanism exists for shares to be created or redeemed by large market participants. These characteristics facilitate efficient pricing through arbitrage. Essentially, when large market participants notice the price of an ETF diverging from the value of the shares held by the fund, new units of the ETF can get created or redeemed in bulk. The divergence quickly narrows as these participants buy or sell ETF units to capture the difference. So, the persistent premium sometimes dear or discount sometimes deep one can easily witness in the CEF universe tend not to occur with the typical ETF. Much of the time, prices for ETFs will tend to be very close to their net asset value. However, it isnt always the case, so proceed with some caution anyway. Both CEF and ETF providers generally publish information about their funds online. You will want to find out what is the underlying Net Asset Value NAV per share, and then you can determine if the market price trades at a premium or a discount to NAV. Assuming little difference in an ETFs price vs. its NAV, the more interesting question to ask about an ETF then becomes whether the NAV itself is a bargain, or not. That means youll need to be more concerned with what stocks are in the index the fund tracks, and whether those stocks are a bargain, or not, at their current prices. i.e. The ETF is a basket, so look at each thing in the basket. Of course, most people buy ETFs because they dont want to do this kind of analysis and are happy with market average returns. Even so, sectorbased ETFs are often used by traders to buy or sell entire sectors that may be undervalued or overvalued."

The leasing company has to raise the cash from somewhere and they dont want to make a loss on the deal. They will probably know better than I how to manage that and will therefore be calculating in the projected resale value at the end of the leasing period. I cant see how an electric car would make any difference here. These people are probably better informed about the resale value of any type of car than I am. My feeling is to buy using a loan from the manufacturer. The rates are often good and I have also got good deals on insurance as a part of that package. Here in Germany the sales tax VAT can be immediately claimed back in full when the loan deal is signed."

    "body": "Even if we accept these claims as being true, neither the fact that their clients are more confident, nor the fact that people who use an investment professional have a higher net worth tells you anything about the value of the service that such professionals provide. Judging a service provider is a complex matter where you take into account multiple variables but the main ones are the cost and quality of the service, the cost and quality of doing it yourself and the value you assign to your time and effort. I think its highly likely that professional gardeners will on average maintain larger gardens than those who do their own garden work. And any professional will have more experience at his profession than an average member of the public. But to determine if hiring a professional is objectively \"better\" requires defining what that word means. Finance is a bit weird in that respect since we actually do have objective ways of measuring results by looking at performance over time. But since the quotes you give here dont address that at all, we can simply conclude that they do not make the case for anything related to financial performance."

From the IRS newsroom Capital gains and losses are classified as longterm or shortterm, depending on how long you hold the property before you sell it. If you hold it more than one year, your capital gain or loss is longterm. If you hold it one year or less, your capital gain or loss is shortterm. The tax rates that apply to net capital gain are generally lower than the tax rates that apply to other income. For 2009, the maximum capital gains rate for most people is15. For lowerincome individuals, the rate may be 0 on some or all of the net capital gain. Special types of net capital gain can be taxed at 25 or 28.

    "header": "Is it bad practice to invest in stocks that fluctuate by single points throughout the day?",
    "body": "Its hard to write much in those comment boxes, so Ill just make an answer, although its really not a formal answer. Regarding commissions, it costs me 5 per trade, so thats actually 10 per trade 5 to buy, 5 to sell. An ETF like TNA 58 per share currently fluctuates 1 or 2 per day. IXC is 40 per share and fluctuates nearly 50 cents per day a little less. So to make any decent money per trade would mean a share size of 50 shares TNA which means I need 2900 in cash TNA is not marginable. If it goes up 1 and I sell, thats 10 for the broker and 40 for me. I would consider this to be the minimum share size for TNA. For IXC, 100 shares would cost me 4000  2  2000 since IXC is marginable. If IXC goes up 50 cents, thats 10 for the broker and 40 for me. IXC also pays a decent dividend. TNA does not. Youll notice the amount of cash needed to capture these gains is roughly the same. Actually, to capture daily moves in IXC, youll need a bit more than 2000 because it doesnt vary quite a full 50 cents each day. At first, I thought you were describing range trading or stock channeling, but those systems require stop losses when the range or channel is broken. Youre now talking about holding forever until you get 1 or 2 points of profit. Therefore, I wouldnt trade stocks at all. Stocks could go to zero, ETFs will not. It seems to me youre looking for a way to generate small, consistent returns and youre not seeking to strike it rich in one trade. Therefore, buying something that pays a dividend would be a good idea if you plan to hold forever while waiting for your 1 or 2 points. In your system youre also going to have to define when to get back in the trade. If you buy IXC now at 40 and it goes to 41 and you sell, do you wait for it to come back to 40? What if it never does? Are you happy with having only made one trade for 40 profit in your lifetime? What if it goes up to 45 and then dips to 42, do you buy at 42? If so, what stops you from eventually buying at the tippy top? Or even worse, what stops you from feeling even more confident at the top and buying bigger lots? If it gets to 49, surely it will cover that last buck to 50, right? sarc What if you bought IXC at 40 and it went down. Now what? Do you take up gardening as a hobby while waiting for IXC to come back? Do you buy more at lower prices and average down? Do you find other stocks to trade? If so, how long until you run out of money and you start getting margin calls? Then youll be forced to sell at the bottom when you should be buying more. All these systems seem easy, but when you actually get in there and try to use them, youll find theyre not so easy. Anything that is obvious, wont work anymore. And even when you find something that is obvious and bet that it stops working, youll be wrong then too. The thing is, if you think of it, many others just like you also think of it... therefore it cant work because everyone cant make money in stocks just like everyone at the poker table cant make money. If you can make 1 or 2 per day on your money, thats actually quite good and not too many people can do that. Or maybe its better to say, if you can make 2 per trade, and not take a 50 loss per 10 trades, youre doing quite well. If you make 40 per trade profit while working with 23k and you do that 50 times per year 50 trades is not a lot in a year, youve doubled your money for the year. Who does that on a consistent basis? To expect that kind of performance is just unrealistic. It much easier to earn 2k with 100k than it is to double 2k in a year. In stocks, money flows TO those who have it and FROM those who dont. You have to plan for all possibilities, form a system then stick to it, and not take on too much risk or expect big unrealistic rewards. Daytrading You make 4 roundtrips in 5 days, that broker labels you a pattern daytrader. Once youre labeled, its for life at that brokerage. If you switch to a new broker, the new broker doesnt know your dealings with the old broker, therefore youll have to establish a new pattern with the new broker in order to be labeled. If the SEC were to ask, the broker would have to say yes or no concering if you established a pattern of daytrading at that brokerage. Suppose you make the 4 roundtrips and then you make a 5th that triggers the call. The broker will call you up and say you either need to deposit enough to bring your account to 25k or you need to never make another daytrade at that firm... ever! Thats the only warning youll ever get. If youre in violation again, they lock your account to closing positions until you send in funds to bring the balance up to 25k. All you need to do is have the money hit your account, you can take it right back out again. Once your account has 25k, youre allowed to trade again.... even if you remove 15k of it that same day. If you trigger the call again, you have to send the 15k back in, then take it back out. Having the label is not all bad... they give you 4x margin. So with 25k, you can buy 100k of marginable stock. I dont know... that could be a bad thing too. You could get a margin call at the end of the day for owning 100k of stock when youre only allowed to own 50k overnight. I believe thats a fed call and its a pretty big deal."

Im wondering if Malaysia is feeling the effects of the US FED which flooded the market with US dollars after the crisis. The Malaysian central bank holds US dollars as its foreign exchange reserves. In order to keep the ringgit from rising against the dollar the Malaysian central bank will print up ringgit to purchase dollars which suppresses the value of the ringgit.

    "header": "Are low commission trading sites safe?",
    "body": "Generally, yes. Rather than ask, \"why are these guys so cheap?\", you should be asking why the big names are so expensive.  Marketing spend plays a big role there. Getting babies to shill for your company during the super bowl requires a heck of a lot of commissions. Due to the difficulties involved in setting up a brokerage, its unlikely that youll see a scam. A brokerage might go bankrupt for random reasons, but thats what investor insurance is for. \"Safeness\" is mostly the likelihood that youll be able to get access to your funds on deposit with the broker. Investment funds are insured by SIPC for up to 500,000, with a lower limit on cash. The specific limits vary by broker, with some offering greater protection paid for on their own dime. Check with the broker  its usually on their web pages under \"Security\". Funds in \"cash\" might be swept into an interestearning investment vehicle for which insurance is different, and that depends on the broker, too. A few Forex brokers went bankrupt last year, although thats a new market with fewer regulatory protections for traders. I heard that one bankruptcy in the space resulted in a 7 loss for traders with accounts there, and that there was a Ponziish scam company as well. Luckily, the more stringent regulation of stock brokerages makes that space much safer for investors. If you want to assess the reliability of an online broker, I suggest the following Its tempting to look at when the brokerage was founded. Flybynight scams, by definition, wont be around very long  and usually that means under a few months. Any company with a significant online interface will have to have been around long enough to develop that client interface, their backend databases, and the interface with the markets and their clearing house. The two brokerages you mentioned have been around for 7 years, so that lends strength to the supposition of a strong business model. That said, there could well be a new company that offers services or prices that fit your investment need, and in that case definitely look into their registrations and thirdparty reviews. Finally, note that the smaller, independent brokerages will probably have stiffer margin rules. If youre playing a complex, novel, andor highrisk strategy that cant handle the volatility of a market crash, even a short excursion such as the 2010 flash crash, stiff margin rules might have consequences that a novice investor would rather pretend didnt exist."

    "body": "Question 2 Some financial institutions can provide a way to invest small amounts with low or no cost fees over a period of time like monthly, weekly, etc. For instance, a few brokerages have a way to buy specific ETFs for no cost outside of the total expense ratio. Question 3 When someone says that investing is like buying a lottery ticket, they are comparing an event that almost always has at least a 99.9 of no return large winnings to an event that has much better odds. Even if I randomly pick a stock in the SP 500 and solely invest in it, over the course of a given year, I do not face a 99.9 chance of losing everything. So comparing the stock market to a lottery, unless a specific lottery has much better odds keep in mind that some of these jackpots have a 99.9999999 of no return is not the same. Unfortunately, nothing truly safe exists  risk may mutate, but its always present instead, the probability of something being safe and or generating a return may be true for a given period of time, while in another given period of time, may become untrue. One may argue that holding cash is safer than buying an index fund or stock, ETF, mutual fund, etc, and financially that may be true over a given period of time for instance, the USD beat the SPY for the year of 2008. Benjamin Franklin, per a biography Im reading, argued that the stock market was superior to gold from the context, it sounds like the cash of his day because of what the stock market represents essentially youre betting on the economic output of workers. Its like saying, in an example using oil, that I believe that even though oil becomes a rare resource in the long run, human workers will find an alternative to oil and will lead to better living standards for all of us. Do civilizations like the Mongolian, Roman, and Ottoman empires collapse? Yes, and would holding the market in those days fail? Yes. But cash and gold might be useless too because we would still need someone to exchange goods with and we would need to have the correct resources to do so if everyone in a city owns gold, gold has little value. The only \"safe bet\" in those days would be farming skill, land, crops and or livestock because even without trading, one could still provide some basic necessities."

We lived on rent in Israel, our horrible apartment was worth 1M and it was horrible. We could never imagine buying it because we were middle class at best. My mother insisted that we all sell whatever we have and buy land and houses in Bulgaria. One house, for example, went from 20k to EUR150k between 2001 and 2007. But we knew Bulgaria, we knew how to buy, we knew lawyers, we knew builders. The company I currently work for. When I joined, share prices were around 240 2006. They are now 2015 at 1500. I didnt buy because I was repaying mortgage at 5. I am very sorry I didnt. Everybody knew 240 is not a real share price for our company  an established 30 years software company with piles of cash. We were not a hot startup, outsiders didnt invest. Many developers and finance people WHO WORK IN THE COMPANY made a fortune. Again relationship, knowledge! I bought a house in the UK in 2012  everyone knew house prices were about to go up. I was lucky I had a friend who was a surveyor, he told me \"buy now or lose money\". I bought a little house for 200k, it is now worth 260k. Not double, but pretty good money! My point is take your investment personally. Dont just dump money into something.

TurboTaxHR Block At Homeetcetc are not for you. These programs are developed for a \"mainstream\" American citizen and resident who has nothing, or practically nothing, abroad. They may support the FBARFATCA forms IIRC HR Block has a problem with Fatca, didnt check if they fixed it for 2013. Heard reports that TurboTax support is not perfect as well, but nothing more than that. If you know the stuff well enough to fill the forms manually  go for it Im not sure they even provide all these forms in the software though. Now, specifically to your questions Turbo tax doesnt seem to like the fact that my wife is a foreigner and doesnt have a social security number. It keeps bugging me to input a valid Ssn for her. I input all zeros for now. Not sure what to do. No, you cannot do that. You need to think whether you even want to include your wife in the return. Does she have income? Do you want to pay US taxes on her income? If shes not a US citizengreen card holder, why would you want that? Consider it again. If you decide to include here after all  you have to get an ITIN for her instead of SSN. If you hire a professional to do your taxes, that professional will also guide you through the ITIN process. Turbo tax forces me to fill out a 29something form that establishes bonafide residency. Is this really necessary? Again in here it bugs me about wifes Ssn Form 2555 probably. Yes, it is, and yes, you have to have a ITIN for your wife if shes included. My previous state is California, and for my present state I input Foreign. When I get to the state tax portion turbo doesnt seem to realize that I have input foreign and it wants me to choose a valid state. However I think my first question is do i have to file a California tax now that I am not its resident anymore? I do not have any assets in California. No house, no phone bill etc If youre not a resident in California, then why would you file? But you might be a partial resident, if you lived in CA part of the year. If so, you need to file 540NR for the part of the year you were a resident. If you have a better way to file tax based on this situation could you please share with me? As I said  hire a professional, preferably one that practices in your country of residence and knows the provisions of that countrys tax treaty with the US. You can also hire a professional in the US, but get a good one, that specializes on expats."

Interest rates  Currently in the US interest rates are rather low which means that borrowers could possibly get good rates on that money thus making it relatively cheap. Compare current interest rates to the early 1980s and there is a major difference. In terms of implications on the stock market, there are a couple that come to my mind Investment options  With low interest rates, cash and bonds arent necessarily yielding that much and thus some people may be more likely to invest elsewhere with stocks being an option. Thus, there may be some people that would rather invest in stocks than hold their investments in loweryielding options. Corporate spending  If rates stay low, then for companies with good financial track records, they could borrow money to expand operations rather than sell more stock and thus there may be companies that borrow to grow so that they take advantage of these interest rates."

    "body": "I am going to break rank slightly with the consensus so far. Heres the deal, it probably DOES help your credit slightly to pay it multiple times per month if it isnt a hassle, but the bump is likely to be minimal and very temporary. Heres why A key component of your score is your credit usage ratio. That is the ratio of how much of your credit limits you are using. You want to keep this number down as low as possible. Now here is where it gets tricky. Although you have a grace period to pay off your card with no interest, the credit card companies dont generally report the balance as of the due date. They either report the high balance or an average balance over the month. That is, it is based on how much you use, not how much balance you carry over each month. It isnt very intuitive, but thats just how it is. So technically, keeping that balance lower over the course of the month WILL probably help you, but the credit usage ratio is generally a rolling average over the last x months, so the effect will wear off quickly. So it is probably not worth doing unless you know you are going to apply for a loan in the next 6 months and need a temporary, small bump. Another consideration is that paying early provides no real financial benefit in terms of finance charges, but you are giving up liquidity which does have some value. 1 You probably could get at least a little interest for keeping the money in your account a few more weeks. 2 If you have a major financial emergency, e.g. broken down car, you might appreciate the fact that you kept your options open to carry that balance over a month."

    "header": "Over the long term, why invest in bonds?",
    "body": "I can think of a few reasons for this. First, bonds are not as correlated with the stock market so having some in your portfolio will reduce volatility by a bit. This is nice because it makes you panic less about the value changes in your portfolio when the stock market is acting up, and Im sure that fund managers would rather you make less money consistently then more money in a more volatile way. Secondly, you never know when you might need that money, and since stock market crashes tend to be correlated with people losing their jobs, it would be really unfortunate to have to sell off stocks when they are underpriced due to market shenanigans. The bond portion of your portfolio would be more likely to be stable and easier to sell to help you get through a rough patch. I have some investment money I dont plan to touch for 20 years and I have the bond portion set to 510 since I might as well go for a \"high growth\" position, but if youre more conservative, and might make withdrawals, its better to have more in bonds... I definitely will switch over more into bonds when I get ready to retire Id rather have slow consistent payments for my retirement than lose a lot in an unexpected crash at a bad time!"

I dont know of any place in America that charges to use the bathroom, but the practice is still common in Europe. I saw the second The Matrix film in Brussels, and had to pay to pee. Im not sure why this isnt the case in the U.S. Maybe there are widespread regulations against this. Or maybe its a cultural thing, that we would be so offended by this that we would never go back to the theater."

    "body": "A person can finance housing expenses in one of two ways. You can pay rent to a landlord. Or you can buy a house with a mortgage. In essence, you become your own landlord. That is, insta the \"renter\" pays an amount equal to the mortgage to insta the \"landlord,\" who pays it to the bank to reduce the mortgage. Ideally, your monthly debt servicing payments minus tax saving on interest should approximate the rent on the house. If they are a \"lot\" more, you may have overpaid for the house and mortgage. The advantage is that your \"rent\" is applied to building up equity by reducing the mortgage in your house. And mortgage payments are tax deductible to the extent of interest expense. At the end of 30 years, or whatever the mortgage term, you have \"portable equity\" in the form a fully paid house, that you can sell to move another house in Florida, or wherever you want to retire. Sometimes, you will \"get lucky\" if the value of the house skyrockets in a short time. Then you can borrow against your appreciation. But be careful, because \"sky rockets\" in housing and elsewhere often fall to earth. But this does represent another way to build up equity by owning a house."

This makes ETFs slightly costlier than the assets held. For ETFs with liquid holdings, its price will rarely vary relative to the holdings, slippage of the ETFs holdings management notwithstanding. This is because the firms responsible for depositing  redeeming will arbitrage their equivalent holdings of the ETF assets prices with the ETF price. For ETFs with illiquid holdings, such as emerging markets, the ETF can vary between trades of the holdings. This will present sometimes large variations between the last price of the ETF vs the last prices of its holdings. If an ETF is shunned, its supply of holdings will simply drop and vice versa."

    "body": "And specifically regarding prices of housing, what factors drive prices in that regard? I mean, the houses are roughly the same... but almost 3 times as expensive. Rent, like so many things, is tied to supply and demand. On the demand side, rent is tied to income. People tend to buy as much house as they can afford, given that mortgage interest is deductible and public schools, financed through property tax, performs better in valuable neighborhoods. Raise the minimum wage and economists expect rents to go up accordingly. When employers and pensions offer COLA adjustments, it feeds into a price loop. During the past ten years, there was also some \"animal spirits\"  irrational behavior present people feared that if they didnt buy now, home prices would outpace their growth in income. So even though it didnt make sense at the time, they bought because it would make even less sense later if you assume prices only go up. Theres also the whole California has nicer weather angle to explain why people move to SF or LA. On the supply side, its all about housing stock. In your old town, you could find vacant lots or farmland in less than 5 minutes drive from anywhere. Theres far less room for growth in say, the SF Bay area or NYC. Theres also building codes that restrict the growth in housing stock. Im told Boulder, CO is one such place. You would think that high prices would discourage people from moving or working there, but between the university and the defense contractors triangle, they seem to have an iron grip on the market. Have you ever seen a cartoon where a character gets a huge bill at a restaurant, and their eyes shoot out of their eye sockets and they faint? Yeah... thats how I felt looking at some of the places around here... Remember, restaurants have to cover the same rent problem you do. And they have higher minimum wages, and taxes, etc. Moreover, food has to be imported from miles away to feed the city, likely even from out of state. In California, theres also food regulations that in effect raise the prices. If people are footing those higher bills, I wouldnt be surprised if theyre racking up debt in the process, and dodging the collectors calling about their Lexus, or taking out home equity loans to cover their lifestyle."

    "body": "Economically, you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutesthey are largely separate markets. Only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is stickyfor example, once you buy a house, prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment. In both markets there is a supply and demand curve, but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals. The market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house. Most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market. This describes a supplydemand graph with a very steep demand curve. Additionally, because of the leverage provided by mortgages, the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans. Thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change. On the other hand, apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parents basements easily move into apartments if prices change. A small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded. This is the situation where the demand curve is shallow. In addition, rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly, nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions in a recession, people avoid buying but renters continue to rent."

If so, by how much? Since it is a game, it is unlikely that deducting losses from your income would be allowed. However, the 4000 would probably not be taxed as income since you are getting your own money back. Situation 3 I deposit 5000 and use this to buy ingame items.

Will I get taxed on withdrawals from Real Cash Economy games? And do the taxes apply to the full withdrawal, or only on the profits? Or only on the profits above a certain amount?

    "body": "You did something that you shouldnt have done you bought a dividend. Most mutual fund companies have educational materials on their sites that recommend against making new investments in mutual funds in the last two months of the year because most mutual funds distribute their earnings dividends, capital gains etc to their shareholders in December, and the share price of the funds goes down in the amount of the per share distribution. These distributions can be taken in cash or can be reinvested in the fund you most likely chose the latter option it is often the default choice if you ignored all this because you are a newbie. For those who choose to reinvest, the number of shares in the mutual fund increases, but since the price of the shares has decreased, the net amount remains the same. You own more shares at a lower price than the day before when the price was higher but the total value of your account is the same ignoring normal market fluctuations in the price of the actual stocks held by the fund. Regardless of whether you take the distributions as cash or reinvest in the fund, that money is taxable income to you unless the fund is owned inside a 401k or IRA or other taxdeferred investment program. You bought 56 shares at a price of 17.857 per share net cost 1000. The fund distributed its earnings shortly thereafter and gave you 71.33356 15.333 additional shares. The new share price is 14.11. So, the total value of your investment is 1012, but the amount that you have invested in the account is the original 1000 plus the amount of the distribution which is roughly 14.11 x 15.333  216. Your total investment of 1216 is now worth 1012 only, and so you have actually lost money. Besides, you owe income tax on that 216 dividend that you received. Do you see why the mutual fund companies recommend against making new investments late in the year? If you had waited till after the mutual fund had made its distribution, you could have bought 100014.11  70.871 shares and wouldnt have owed tax on that distribution that you just bought by making the investment just before the distribution was made.

As a seller you want to be matched with the Bid price to get a sale, but you also need to check the current list of Ask prices. If the price you want to sell at is too high you will be placed down the Ask price list, and unless the price moves up to match your sell price you will not end up selling. On the otherhand, if your price to sell is too low and in fact much lower than the current lowest sell price you may get a quick sale but maybe at a lower price than you could have gotten. Similarly, when looking to buy, you would generally also look at both the Bid and Ask prices. As a buyer you want to be matched with the Ask price to get a sale, but you also need to check the current list of Bid prices.

Edit To Clarify Victors comment Typically from the time one sells the stocks to the time it actually gets transferred has a clearing cycle. Most stock exchanges have 2 or 3 days cycles. i.e. if I sell the stock today, it is still in my name. The money is still with the buyer. On Day 1, the positions are arrived at. On Day 2 the stock gets credited to the buyer and the funds gets credit to seller. As the question was specific whether to hold the stock till 7th or 22nd Sept, my initial answer was simple.

You sell it at a loss but then buy it back within the wash sale period. When you sell the replacement stock, your gain or loss will be longterm  no matter how soon you sell it. Charles Schwab also mentions this Heres a quick example of a wash sale. On 930XX, you buy 500 shares of ABC at 10 per share. One year later the stock price starts to drop, and you sell all your shares at 9 per share on 104XY. Two days later, on 106, ABC bottoms out at 8 and you buy 500 shares again. This series of trades triggers a wash sale. The holding period of the original shares will be added to the holding period of the replacement shares, effectively leaving you with a longterm position."

The primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds, that can be utilized for funding the business.

For example with the current 100 invested, the company is able to generate say 125 [25 as profit]. If additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering, then with 200, the company should mark around 250, else it looses value. So if the company took additional 100 and did not  is not able to deploy in market, on 200 they still make 25 as profit, its bad. There are other reasons, i.e. to fight off hostile acquisition or dilute some of promoters shares etc. Thus the reasons for company to do a secondary PO are few and doing it often reduces the value for primary share holders as well as minority share holders."

What kind of taxes are we looking into paying into the business besides setup of everything compared to being a self proprietor? Im seeing that the general answer is no, as long as income is 200k, but not certain. Unless you decide to have your LLC taxed as a corporation, theres no change in taxes. LLC, by default, is a passthrough entity and all income will flow to your respective tax returns. From tax perspective, the LLC will be treated as a partnership. It will file form 1065 to report its income, and allocate the income to the memberspartners on schedules K1 which will be given to you. Youll use the numbers on the K1 to transfer income allocated to you to your tax returns and pay taxes on that.

What kind of forms are we looking into needingproviding when switching to a LLC from freelance work? Normally we just get 1099s, what would that be now? Your contract counterparts couldnt care less about your tax problems. Unless you are a corporation, people who pay you more than 600 a year must file a 1099. Since youll be a partnership, youll need to provide the partnership EIN instead of your own SSN, but thats the only difference. Are LLCs required to pay taxes 4 times per year? We would definitely get an accountant for things, but being as this is side work, there will be times where we choose to not take on clients, which could cause multiple months of no income. Obviously we would save for when we need to pay taxes, but is there a magic number that says \"you must now pay four times per year\". Unless you choose to tax your LLC as a corporation, LLC will pay no taxes. You will need to make sure you have enough withholding to cover for the additional income, or pay the quarterly estimates. The magic number is 1000. If your withholdingestimates is 1000 less than what your tax liability is, youll be penalized, unless the total withholdingestimates is more than 100 of your prior year tax liability or 110, depending on the amounts. The LLC would be 50 50, but that work would not always be that. We will be taking on smaller project through the company, so there will be times where one of us could potentially be making more money. Are we setting ourselves up for disaster if one is payed more than the other while still having equal ownership? Partnerships can be very flexible, and equity split doesnt have to be the same as income, loss or assets split. But, youll need to have a lawyer draft your operational agreement which will define all these splits and who gets how much in what case. Make sure to cover as much as possible in that agreement in order to avoid problems later."

Your rant expresses a misunderstanding of fundamental economics as demand for used cars increases, so will prices but economics is offtopic here, so let me explain why I bought a new carthat I am now in the 10th year of driving. When I bought the car I currently drive, I was single, I was working fulltime, and I was going to school fulltime. I bought a 2007 Toyota Corolla for about 16,500 cash out the door. I wanted a reliable car that was clean and attractive enough that I wouldnt be embarrassed in it if I took a girl out for dinner. I could have bought a much more expensive car, but I wanted to be real about myself and not give the wrong impression about my views on money. Ive done all the maintenance, and the car is still very nice even after 105K miles. It will handle at least that many more miles barring any crashes. Could I have purchased a nice used car for less? Certainly, but because it was the last model year before a redesign, the dealer was clearly motivated to give me a good deal, so I didnt lose too much driving it off the lot. There are a lot of reasons why people buy new cars. I didnt want to look like a chump when out on a date. Realestate agents often like to make a good impression as they are driving clients to see new homes. Some people can simply afford it and dont want to worry about what abuse a prior owner may have done. I dont feel defensive about my decision to buy a new car those years ago. The other car Ive purchased in the last 10 years was a four year old used car, and it certainly does a good job for my wife who doesnt put too many miles on it. I will not rule out buying another new car in the future either. Some times the difference in price isnt significant enough that used is always the best choice."

    "header": "When an investor makes money on a short, who loses the money?",
    "body": "Michael gave a good answer describing the transaction but I wanted to follow up on your questions about the lender. First, the lender does charge interest on the borrowed securities. The amount of interest can vary based on a number of factors, such as who is borrowing, how much are they borrowing, and what stock are they trying to borrow. Occasionally when you are trying to short a stock you will get an error that it is hard to borrow. This could be for a few reasons, such as there are already a large amount of people who have shorted your brokers shares, or your broker never acquired the shares to begin with which usually only happens on very small stocks. In both cases the brokerlender doesnt have enough shares and may be unwilling to get more. In that way they are discriminating on what they lend. If a company is about to go bankrupt and a lender doesnt have any more shares to lend out, it is unlikely they will purchase more as they stand to lose a lot and gain very little. It might seem like lending is a risky business but think of it as occurring over decades and not months. General Motors had been around for 100 years before it went bankrupt, so any lender who had owned and been lending out GM shares for a fraction of that time likely still profited. Also this is all very simplified. JoeTaxpayer alluded to this in the comments but in actuality who is lending stock or even who owns stock is much more complicated and probably doesnt need to be explained here. I just wanted to show in this oversimplified explanation that lending is not as risky as it may first seem."

In 2011, the SP closed at 1257.60 vs a 2010 year end 1257.64. The return, however was 2.11, not zero, after accounting for the dividends.

    "body": "One explanation is that movie patrons are considering their total willingness to pay for the movie experience so that if the ticket price plus the market price of popcorn is less than their willingness to pay WTP, the theater has an opportunity to extract more consumer surplus by charging higher than market prices for the popcorn that is, price discrimination. There is a working paper on the subject by Gill and Hartmann 2008, the abstract of which reads Prices for goods such as blades for razors, ink for printers and concessions at movies are often set well above cost. Theory has shown that this could yield a profitable price discrimination strategy often termed metering. The idea is that a customers intensity of demand for aftermarket goods e.g. the concessions provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to pay for the primary good e.g. admission. If this correlation in tastes for the two goods is positive, a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price admissions plus concessions from higher type customers. This paper develops a simple aggregate model of discretecontinuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data. Model simulations illustrate that the regressions can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above, below or equal to their marginal cost. We then apply the approach to boxoffice and concession data from a chain of Spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket. Locay and Rodriquez 1992 make a similar argument in a JPE article. They essentially argue that purchases of things like movie tickets are made by groups once individuals are constrained by the groups choice, the firm has additional market power We present models in which price discrimination in the context of a twopart price can occur in some competitive markets. Purchases take place in groups, which choose which firms to patronize. While firms are perfectly competitive with respect to groups, they have some market power over individual consumers, who are constrained by their groups choices. We find that firms will charge an entry fee that is below marginal cost, and the second part of the price is marked up above marginal cost. The markup not only is positive but increases with the quality of the product. The quote you are looking for is similar, and again attributes the discrepancy to price discrimination. From the Armchair Economist p. 159 The purpose of expensive popcorn is not to extract a lot of money from customers. That purpose would be better served by cheap popcorn and expensive movie tickets. Instead, the purpose of expensive popcorn is to extract different sums from different customers. Popcorn lovers, who have more fun at the movies, pay more for their additional pleasure. That is, some people like popcorn more than others. The latter idea is that the movie experience for popcorn lovers is worth more than the sum of its parts that a movie ticket  popcorn is worth more than either of them separately for some people."

    "body": "Ive been highly compensated for a while now, and I have never used a tax professional. My past complications include the year that my company was bought by a VC firm and my stock options and stock held were bought out to the tune of 5x my salary. And now I have two kids in college, with scholarships, and paying the remainder out of 529 accounts. Usually, I dont even use tax software. My typical method is to use the online software  like turbotax online  and let it figure out where I am. Then I use the \"Free File Fillable forms\" online to actually complete the process. Search for \"Free File Fillable Forms\"  its not the same as using turbotax or TaxAct for free. My suggestion to you download the PDF form of 1040EZ and 1040A from the IRS. Print the EZ, and fill it out. This will give you a better feel for what exactly is going on. With your income, I dont think you can file the EZ, but its a good way to get your feet wet. The way income taxes work here in the US According to the IRS, the Personal Exemption this year is worth 4,050, and the Standard Deduction 6,300, assuming youre single. Lets assume that your salary will be in fact 75,000, and you dont pay for any benefits, but you do make a 401k contribution of 15 of your salary. Then your W2 at the end of the year should tell you to put 63,750 in a particular box on your 1040 form. 63,750 is 85 of 75,000. Lets then assume 63,750 is your AGI after other additions and subtractions. 63,750  4,050  6,300  53,400. The federal Tax system is graduated, meaning there are different ranges brackets with different percentages. The term tax people use for taxable income of 53,400 is \"marginal tax rate\"...so the last dollar they tax at 25. Other dollars less. According to the IRS, if youre single, then on 53,400, you pay \"6,897.50 plus 25 of the amount over 50,400\" Or 6897.50  750, or 7647.50. Note this is only Federal Income Tax. You will also be paying Social Security and Medicare payroll Tax. And Im guessing youll also be paying colorado state income tax. Each state has its own forms and methods for figuring out the taxes and stuff. By the way, when you start, youll fill out a \"W4\" form to \"help\" you figure out how much to withhold from every paycheck. I find the W4 is not helpful at all. Your company will withhold from your paycheck some mysterious amount, and the process of filling out your 1040A or 1040EZ or whatever will be, likely, to get the overwithheld amount back."

In broader term you will find after reversal a leg trend is formed, then body and then head which is smaller then price reverses. The first leg that forms if it refuses to break 23.6 or 38.2 then the previous trend may continue. 50 is normal usually this level is indecision phase. Even 61.8 is seen as indecision but it is crucial level as it is breakout level towards 100. Now if the stock retraces 100 then it is sign a new big trend is forming. Now for day trader 23.6,38.2 and 50 level are very crucial from trading purpose. This concept is so realistic that every level is considered and respected. Suppose if a candle or bar starts at 23.6 level and crosses 38.2 and directly hits 50. Then the next bar or candle will revert and first hit 38.2 and then continue with the trend. It means price comes back, forms it area at this level and then continue whichever direction the force directs it.

    "body": "I think Energy and Mike point out the some serious issues but the prospects for the futures also need to be considered. If the banks no longer have those loans then they need to rebuild their income base that is wiped out by the payoff of their loans. They would be incentivised to make a large number of loans so that they could quickly reestablish their base so they can maintain profitability. This is likely to lead to more poor lending practices that lead to this location in the first place. The high earning heavily leveraged would benefit far more from this than the poor. A function of income is that as it increases the ability to leverage increases in a non lineal fashion. So single person making 250k a yearthe benchmark set by the current administration with a 2 million dollar mortgageprobably underwater currently on a home would benefit much more than a family of 4 making 50k a year with a 100k mortgage. Assuming that government does pay off all mortages now people can sell of their now fully paid homes for less than their value, as its basically free money, leverage that money to move into a better home, so home values actually crash, in some areas as people sell them off cheap, people try to gamble on cheap houseslike we just saw, etc. It takes a market that is on the verge of recovery and stabilization and shakes it up. How long before it stabilizes again would be a matter of debate but I would not expect to see it in less than a decade. Business and the Economy thrives on stability and retreats from instability. So while this would appear to be an injection to the economy the chaos it creates would likely actually severely retard future economic growth."

One personal finance blogger that I read swears by the fact that he and his wife keep their finances totally separate. His wife has her own retirement account, he has his. His wife has her own checking and savings, he has his. They pay fiftyfifty for expenses and each buy their own \"toys\" from their own accounts. He views this as valuable for allowing them to have their own personal finance styles, as his wife is a very conservative investor and he is more generous. My spouse and I have mostly combined finances, and view all of our money as joint even though there are a smattering of accounts between us with just one name on them as holdovers from before we were married. Almost all of our purchasing decisions except regular groceries are joint. I couldnt imagine it any other way. It leaves us both comfortable with our financial situation and forces us to be on the same page with regards to our lifestyle decisions. Theres also the ideological view that since we believe marriage united us, we try to live that out. Thats just us, though. We dont want to force it on others. Some couples find a balance between joint accounts and his and her fun money stashes. You might find yet another arrangement that works for you, such as the one you already described. Whats going to be important is that you realize that all couples have the same six basic arguments, finances being one of them. The trick is in how you disagree. If you can respectfully and thoughtfully discuss your finances together to find the way that has the least friction for you, youre doing well. Some amount of friction is not just normal, its almost guaranteed."

    "body": "The only \"authoritative document\" issued by the IRS to date relating to Cryptocurrencies is Notice 201421. It has this to say as the first QA Q1 How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes? A1 For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. That is to say, it should be treated as property like any other asset. Basis reporting the same as any other property would apply, as described in IRS documentation like Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses and Publication 551, Basis of Assets. You should be able to use the same basis tracking method as you would use for any other capital asset like stocks or bonds. Per Publication 550 \"How To Figure Gain or Loss\", You figure gain or loss on a sale or trade of property by comparing the amount you realize with the adjusted basis of the property. Gain. If the amount you realize from a sale or trade is more than the adjusted basis of the property you transfer, the difference is a gain. Loss. If the adjusted basis of the property you transfer is more than the amount you realize, the difference is a loss. That is, the assumption with property is that you would be using specific identification. There are specific rules for mutual funds to allow for using average cost or defaulting to FIFO, but for general \"property\", including individual stocks and bonds, there is just Specific Identification or FIFO and FIFO is just making an assumption about what youre choosing to sell first in the absence of any further information. You dont need to track exactly \"which Bitcoin\" was sold in terms of exactly how the transactions are on the Bitcoin ledger, its just that you bought x bitcoins on date d, and when you sell a lot of up to x bitcoins you specify in your own records that the sale was of those specific bitcoins that you bought on date d and report it on your tax forms accordingly and keep track of how much of that lot is remaining. It works just like with stocks, where once you buy a share of XYZ Corp on one date and two shares on another date, you dont need to track the movement of stock certificates and ensure that you sell that exact certificate, you just identify which purchase lot is being sold at the time of sale."

Basically, an exchange is a market, and the price is defined only by supply and demand in that market. However, any substantial price differential for a commodity traded in multiple market creates an arbitrage opportunity, and there are many traders whose job it is exactly to find and use such opportunities. Their activity in turn has the effect of reducing the price differentials to the point where transaction costs make them unprofitable. With highfrequency traders around, the time for a price differential to disappear is nowadays measured in milliseconds. If a trader buys from one exchange, will it affect the price of the other?

This is a huge drain if you make a lot of transactions and can easily be a much larger concern than a relatively trivial difference in ongoing charges depending on your exact expected trading frequency. Poor spreads are also generally related to a lack of liquidity, and illiquid assets are usually the first to become heavily disconnected from the underlying in cases where the authorized participants APs face issues. In general with stock ETFs that trade very liquid markets this has historically not been much of an issue, as the creationredemption mechanism on these types of assets is pretty robust its consequences on typical spread is much more important for the average retail investor. On point 3, no, this would create an arbitrage which an authorized participant would quickly take advantage of.

For example, when you buy your groceries at Walmart, you pay at least a 4 markup because thats the standardized cost of processing credit cards. Even if you paid in cash! A wealthy person uses his credit card to pay for the same but earns the same percentage amount in cash back, points and what not.

Income earned by the trust or estate property e.g., rents collected from real estate is income earned by the trust or the estate. Who is liable for taxes on income earned by a trust depends on who receives or retains benefits from the trust. Who is liable for taxes on income received by an estate depends on how the income is classified i.e., income earned by the decedent, income earned by the estate, income in respect of the decedent, or income distributed to beneficiaries. Generally, trusts and estates are taxed like individuals. General tax principles that apply to individuals therefore also apply to trusts and estates. A trust or estate may earn taxexempt income and may deduct certain expenses. Each is allowed a small exemption 300 for a simple trust, 100 for a complex trust, 600 for an estate. However, neither is allowed a standard deduction. The tax brackets for income taxable to a trust or estate are much more compressed and can result in higher taxes than for individuals.

Even though there are 3.8 billion shares of common stock, the Class B owners which are Ford family hold 40 of the voting power and so their desires are given much weight. The Class B owners prefer regular dividends because if enough were to sell their Class B shares, all Class B shares as a block would have their voting power drop from 40 to 30, and with further sales all special voting would be lost and each Class B share would be equivalent to a common share in voting power. Hence the Class B owners, both for themselves and for all of the family members holding Class B, avoid selling shares and prefer receiving dividends."

It is smarter to hand out a fact sheet or speak from a rehearsed script so that you dont say something that would be actionable. Make sure you pick the busiest day of the week for a dry cleaner. Weekends? I dont think this is criminal, but you can sue. Like others said, if you have the cleaning ticket and the ticket doesnt absolve the dry cleaner of responsibility you will probably get a judgement. Be careful what you ask for, make sure you cover all of your costs the pants, filing fees, time off of work, and collection efforts. Itemize all your requested costs and make sure they are reasonable. You only want to be made whole, and that only means 160 or pants plus fees Just because you won in small claims doesnt mean you can collect easily. Figure in your cost for collecting when you sue. You might have to hire somebody to collect on your judgement. If you hire somebody they will want a cut, so you might want to figure that out for your small claims. I am guessing this is a local business, so it should be pretty easy to collect. Unless they go out of business, in which case you will get nothing."

This has to be stated upfront for you to know the real value. On listing if the value is say 80, then if you have the option to exercise at 10, or 20 you would make money, else at 100 you loose money and hence choose not to exercise the option.

    "body": "It doesnt make a whole lot of sense to save up and wait to make a payment on any of these loans. Any dollar you pay today works better than saving it and waiting months to pay it, no matter which loan it will be applied to. Since your lender wont let you choose which loan your payment is being applied to, dont worry about it. Just make as big a payment as you can each month, and try to get the whole thing out of your life as soon as possible. The result of this will be that the smaller balance loans will be paid off first, and the bigger balance loans later. It is unfortunate that the higher interest rate loans will be paid later, but it sounds like you dont have a choice, so it is not worth worrying about. Instead of thinking of it as 5 loans of different amounts, think of it as one loan with a balance of 74,000, and make payments as quickly and as often as possible. For example, lets say that you have 1000 a month extra to throw at the loans. You would be better off paying 1000 each month than waiting until you have 4000 in the bank and paying it all at once toward one loan. How the lender divides up your payment is less significant than when the lender gets the payment."

One risk of paying off a card is that the card issuer may choose to reduce your credit limit if they see you as high risk, to prevent you respending the money. If you dont trust yourself with the card then this could be a good thing and remember youre always free to ask for a limit decrease. But if you want access to emergency funds, then I would suggest paying half onto each card. That way if one card cuts you off, you have a chance of still having access to the other in an emergency."

If your investments are in your local currency and your future expenses usage of the returns on the investments will be in your local currency FX has no effect. To answer your question, however, since all investments involve flows of money there can be no investment other than perhaps gold which is really a form of currency that isnt bound to at least one currency. In general investments are expected to be valued against the investors home currency I tend to call it \"fund currency\" as I work with hedge funds as the return on the investment will be paid out in the fund currency and returns will be compared on the same basis. If investments are to be made internationally then it is necessary to reduce, or \"hedge\" the exchange rate risk. This is normally done using FX swaps or futures that allow an exchange rate in the future to be locked in today. Far from being unbound from FX moves these derivatives are closely bound to any moves but crucially are bound in the opposite direction to the hoped for FX move. an example of this would be if Im investing 100GBP my local currency in a US company XYZ corp which I expect to do well. Suppose I get 200USD for my 100GBP and so buy 1  200USD shares in XYZ. No matter what happens to XYZ stock any move in GBPUSD will affect my PL so I buy a future that allows me to exchange 200USD for 100GBP in 6 months time. If GBP rises I can sell the future and make money on both the higher exchange rate and the increase in XYZ corp. If GBP falls I can keep the future until maturity and exchange the 200USD from XYZ corp for 100GBP so I only take the foreign exchange hit on any profits. If I expect my profits to be 10USD I can even buy futures such that I can lock in the exchange rate for 110USD in 6 months so that I will lose even less of my profit from the exchange rate move."

Sometimes shortening the length of the loan will get you a lower rate, sometimes it wont. In any case, make sure you can pay it off quickly no matter the term that you sign with. Each bank may have different policies. Talk to at least two of them even if the first one offers you terms that you like. Talking to a loan officer is valuable life experience, and if you discuss your goals directly with them, then they will be able to give you feedback about whether they think a small loan is worth their time."

For me, with the investing knowledge I have right now, investing in an individual stock would be way too risky.

    "header": "What are the benefits of investing to IRARoth IRA, 401k in comparison to investing in long term CDs?",
    "body": "First, you need to understand the difference in discussing types of investments and types of accounts. Certificate of Deposits CDs, money market accounts, mutual funds, and stocks are all examples of types of investments. 401k, IRA, Roth IRA, and taxable accounts are all examples of types of accounts. In general, those are separate decisions to make. You can invest in any type of investment inside any type of account. So your question really has two different parts Taxadvantaged retirement accounts vs. Standard taxable accounts FDICinsured CDs vs. atrisk investments such as stock mutual funds Retirement accounts are special accounts allowed by the federal government that allow you to delay or, in some cases, completely avoid paying taxes on your investment. The tradeoff for these accounts is that, in general, you cannot access any of the money that you put into these accounts until you get to retirement age without paying a steep penalty. These accounts exist to encourage citizens to save for their own retirement. Examples of retirement accounts include 401k and IRAs. Standard taxable accounts have no tax advantages, but no restrictions, either. You can put money in and take money out whenever you like. However, anything that your investment earns is taxable each year. Inside any of these accounts, you can invest in FDICinsured bank accounts, such as savings accounts or CDs, or you can invest in any number of noninsured investments, including money market accounts, bonds, mutual funds, stocks, precious metals, etc. Something you need to understand about investing in general is that your potential returns are directly related to the amount of risk that you take on. Investing in an insured investment, which is guaranteed by the government to never lose its value, will result in the lowest potential investment returns that you can get. Interestbearing savings accounts are currently paying less than 1 interest. A CD will get you a slightly higher interest rate in exchange for you agreeing not to withdraw your money for a period of time. However, it takes a long time for your investments to grow with these investments. If you are earning 1, it takes 72 years for your investment to double. If you are willing to take some risk, you can earn much more with your investments. Bonds are often considered quite safe with a bond, you loan money to a government or corporation, and they pay you back with interest. The risk comes from the possibility that the government or corporation wont pay you back, so it is important to choose a bond from an entity that you trust. Stocks are shares in forprofit companies. Your potential investment gain is unlimited, but it is risky, as stocks can go down in value, and companies can close. However, it is important to note that if you take the largest 500 stocks together SP 500, the average value has consistently gone up over the long term. In the last 35 years, this average value has gone up about 11. At this rate, your investment would double in less than 7 years. To avoid the risk of picking a losing stock, you can invest in a mutual fund, which is a collection of stocks, bonds, or other investments. The idea is that you can, with one investment, invest in many stocks, essentially earning the average performance of all the stocks. There is still risk, as the market can be down as a whole, but you are insulated from any one stock being bad because you are diversified. If you are investing for something in the longterm future, such as retirement, stock mutual funds provide a good rate of return at an acceptablylow level of risk, in my opinion."

If you are VAT registered, then you MUST charge every customer 20 VAT. Business customers dont mind at all, but private customers will be happier if you dont charge VAT because your bills will be a lot lower. You take all the VAT that you received, then subtract all the VAT that you paid for business expenses and that you have invoices for, and send the remainder to HMRC four times a year. The reason that businesses dont mind paying VAT is because they can in turn deduct the VAT they pay you from the VAT that they received and for every pound they give you, they give one pound less to HMRC. Note that when you have expenses that are deductible from your profits, you can now only deduct the cost excluding VAT. On the other hand, the VAT you receive doesnt count as income and doesnt lead to profits that you need to pay income tax for.

    "body": "You dont state where you are, so any answers to this will by necessity be very general in nature. How many bank accounts should I have and what kinds You should have one transaction account and one savings account. You can get by with just a single transaction account, but I really dont recommend that. These are referred to with different names in different jurisdictions, but the basic idea is that you have one account where money is going in and out the transaction account, and one where money goes in and stays the savings account. You can then later on, as you discover various needs, build on top of that basic foundation. For example, I have separate accounts for each source of money that comes into my personal finances, which makes things much easier when I sit down to fill out the tax forms up to almost a year and a half later, but also adds a bit of complexity. For me, that simplicity at tax time is worth the additional complexity for someone just starting out, it might not be. And of course, it is completely unnecessary if you have only one source of taxable income and no other specific reason to separate income streams. how much percentagewise of my income should I put into each one? With a single transaction account, your entire income will be going into that account. Having a single account to pay money into will also make life easier for your employer. You will then have to work out a budget that says how much you plan to spend on food, shelter, savings, and so on. how do I portion them out into budgets and savings? If you have no idea where to start, but have an appropriate financial history as opposed to just now moving into a household of your own, bring out some old account statements and categorize each line item in a way that makes sense to you. Dont be too specific four or five categories will probably be plenty. These are categories like \"living expenses\" rent, electricity, utilities, ..., \"food and eating out\" everything you put in your mouth, \"savings\" dont forget to subtract what you take out of savings, and so on. This will be your initial budget. If you have no financial history, you are probably quite young and just moving out from living with your parents. Ask them how much might be reasonable in your area to spend on basic food, a place to live, and so on. Use those numbers as a starting point for a budget of your own, but dont take them as absolute truths. Always have a \"miscellaneous expenses\" or \"other\" line in your budget. There will always be expenses that you didnt plan for, andor which dont neatly fall into any other category. Allocate a reasonable sum of money to this category. This should be where you take money from during a normal month when you overshoot in some budget category your savings should be a last resort, not something you tap into on a regular basis. If you find yourself needing to tap into your savings on a regular basis, adjust your budget accordingly. Figure out based on your projected expenses and income how much you can reasonably set aside and not touch. Its impossible for us to say exactly how much this will be. Some people have trouble setting aside 5 of their income on a regular basis without touching it others easily manage to save over 50 of their income. Dont worry if this turns out a small amount at first. Get in touch with your bank and set up an automatic transfer from your transaction account to the savings account, set to recur each and every time you get paid you may want to allow a day or two of margin to ensure that the money has arrived in your account before it gets taken out, of the amount you determined that you can save on a regular basis. Then, try to forget that this money ever makes it into your finances. This is often referred to as the \"pay yourself first\" principle. You wont hit your budget exactly every month. Nobody does. In fact, its more likely that no month will have you hit the budget exactly. Try to stay under your budgeted expenses, and when you get your next pay, unless you have a large bill coming up soon, transfer whatever remains into your savings account. Spend some time at the end of each month looking back at how well you managed to match your budget, and make any necessary adjustments. If you do this regularly, it wont take very long, and it will greatly increase the value of the budget you have made. Should I use credit cards for spending to reap benefits? Only if you would have made those purchases anyway, and have the money on hand to pay the bill in full when it comes due. Using credit cards to pay for things is a great convenience in many cases. Using credit cards to pay for things that you couldnt pay for using cash instead, is a recipe for financial disaster. People have also mentioned investment accounts, brokerage accounts, etc. This is good to have in mind, but in my opinion, the exact \"savings vehicle\" type of place where you put the money is a lot less important than getting into the habit of saving regularly and not touching that money. That is why I recommend just a savings account if you miscalculate, forgot a large bill coming up, or for any other good! reason need access to the money, it wont be at a time when the investment has dropped 15 in value and you face a large penalty for withdrawing from your retirement savings. Once you have a good understanding of how much you are able to save reliably, you can divert a portion of that into other savings vehicles, including retirement savings. In fact, at that point, you probably should. Also, I suggest making a list of every single bill you pay regularly, its amount, when you paid it last time, and when you expect the next one to be due. Some bills are easy to predict \"234 rent is due the 1st of every month\", and some are more difficult \"the electricity bill is due on the 15th of the month after I use the electricity, but the amount due varies greatly from month to month\". This isnt to know exactly how much you will have to pay, but to ensure that you arent surprised by a bill that you didnt expect."

    "body": "I think a larger issue is that youre trying to do market timing. Whether you had a large or small amount of money to invest, no one wants to put the money in to watch it go down. You cant really predict if prices in a market or security will go up in six months in which case you want to put all your cash in now, of if it will go down in which case youd want to wait until the bottom, or if it will skitter around in which case youd want to only buy at the bottoms. Of course, if youre magic enough to nail all of those market conditions, youre a master finance trader and will quickly make billions. If youre really concerned with protecting your money and want to take some long positions, Id look into some put options. Youll of course pay the fees for those put options, but theyll protect your downside. Much of this depends on your time horizon at the age of 35, someone can expect to see 6 more recessions and perhaps 30 more market corrections before retirement. With that big of a time range, its best to avoid microoptimizing since that tends to hurt your performance overall because you wont be able to time the market correctly most of the time. One thing thats somewhat reasonable, if you have the stomach for it, is to not buy at somewhatobvious market highs and wait for corrections. This isnt fool proof by any means, but as an example many people realized that US equities basically were on a 5 year up run by December 2014. Many people cashed out those positions, expecting that a correction would be due. And around late summer of 2015, that correction came. For those with patience, they made 15 with a few mouse clicks. Of course many others would have been waiting for that correction since 2010 and missed out on the market increases. Boiled down"

So, if I were in your position, I would pay off the mortgage first. If you dont have 36 months in savings for an emergency, I would invest that much money in low risk investments. Anything remaining I would invest in a balanced portfolio of mutual funds. The biggest benefit to this is the flexibility it gives you.

The 26d EMA is considered the long moving average when in this case it is compared to the shorter 12d EMA. If you used a 5d EMA and a 10d EMA then the 10d EMA would be considered the long MA. It is based on what you are comparing it with. Apart from providing signals for a reversal in trend, MACD can also be used as an early indication to a possible end to a trend. What you look out for is divergence between the price and the MACD. See chart below of an example Here I have used 10d  3d EMAs and 1 for the signal as I did not want the signal to show up. I am simply using the MACD as a momentum indicator  which work by providing higher highs in the MACD with higher highs in price. This shows that the momentum in the trend is good so the trend should continue. However the last high in price is not met with a higher high in the MACD. The green lines demonstrate bearish divergence between price and the MACD, which is an indication that the momentum of the trend is slowing down. This could provide forewarning that the trend may be about to end and to take caution  i.e. not a good time to be buying this stock or if you already own it you may want to tighten up your stop loss."

You now have an unrealized profit of 5. Now, you can either sell and realize that profit, or hold on to the position, expecting a further price appreciation. In either case, you will consider the price change from this traded price, which is 55, and not the price you actually bought at. Hence, if the price fell to 52 in the next trade, you have a loss of 3 on your previous profit of 5. This even though your net PL is calculated from the initial purchase price of 50, allows you to think in terms of your positions at the latest known prices. This is similar to a Markov process, in the sense that it doesnt matter which route the stock price and your positions PL took to get to the current point your decision should be based on the currentlatest price level."

    "body": "Be very careful about buying property because it has been going up quickly in recent years. There are some fundamental factors that limit the amount realestate can appreciate over time. In a nutshell, the general realestate market growth is supported by the entrylevel property market. That is, when values are appreciating, people can sell and use the capital gains to buy more valuable property. This drives up the prices in higher value properties whose owners can use that to purchase more expensive properties and so on and so forth. At some point in a rising market, the entrylevel properties start to become hard for entrylevel buyers to afford. The machine of rising prices throughout the market starts grinding to a halt. This pricelevel can be calculated by looking at average incomes in an area. At some percentage of income, people cannot buy into the market without crazy loans and if those become popular, watch out because things can get really ugly. If you want an example, just look back to the US in 20072009 and the nearly apocalyptic financial crisis that ensued. As with most investing, you want to buy low and sell high. Buying into a hot market is generally not very profitable. Buying when the market is abnormally low tends to be a more effective strategy."

This all happens more or less immediately theres no way to cancel it once it has been placed. A limit order asks to be filled at a particular price, and if no counterparties want to trade at that price right now, then the order will just sit around all day waiting for someone to agree on the price it can be canceled at any time. A fillorkill order asks to be filled at a particular price like a limit order, but if that price or a better one is not currently available then the order is immediately canceled. It does not accept a worse price the way a market order does, nor does it sit around waiting the way a limit order does.

For example, when companies that arent completely falling apart are selling for less than book value andor less than five times prior peak earnings thats a good sign.

I wanted all my bills due early in the month get paid, pay bill, know how much I have left. When I went back to every other week spreading them out made more sense. No credit card had a problem with this. The transitional cycle was not the correct length, but after that it was fine. As Dheer pointed out extending the cycle to 90 days would involve them extending credit for much longer than they would be comfortable. Also the goal of keeping utilization under 30 would be very difficult, you would have to keep your spending per month to less than 10 of your credit limit. Some people have trouble not falling behind on credit card bills, having to set aside the money to pay the bill every 90 day may be way to tough for many people."

Options expiring outside that grey area should experience little to no price change in reaction to the announcement of the date  unless the date was itself surprising, e.g. an earlier date would increase the premium on earlier dated options, a later date would increase the premium for laterdated options. As for 2 The exact date will probably always be a mystery, but the main factors are  the historical pattern of earnings call dates and announcements of those dates which you can look up for any given company  when the companys quarter ends  potentially some influence in how long it takes the company to close out their books for the quarter some types of businesses would be faster than others  any special considerations for this particular quarter that affect reporting ability And finally  a surprise of an earnings call occurring substantively later than usual is rarely going to be a good sign for the underlying security, and the expectation of catastrophe  while cratering the underlying  may also cause a disproportionate rise in IVsprices due to fear"

    "body": "As others have pointed out your bond funds should have short durations, preferably not more than about 2 years. If you are in a bond fund for the long haul meaning you do not have to draw on your bond fund a short time after interest rates have gone up, it is not a big issue. The funds holdings will eventually turn over into higher interest bearing paper. If bonds do go down, you might want to add more to the funds see my comment on agespecific asset allocation below. Keep in mind that some stocks are interest sensitive, for example utility stocks which are used as an income source and their dividends compete with rates on CDs which are much safer. Right now CD rates are very low. This could change. Its possible that we may be in an unusually sensitive interest rate period that might have large effects on the stock market, yet to be determined. The reason is that rates have been so low for such a long time that folks that normally would have obtained income streams from bonds have turned to dividend bearing stocks. Some believe that recent market rises are due to such people seeking dividends to enhance cash inflows. If, and emphasis on if, this is true, we could see a sharp drop in the market as sell offs occur as those who want cash streams move from stocks to ultra safe, government insured CDs. Only time will tell if this is going to play out. If retirement for you is 15 years in the future and the market goes down bonds or equities, good stuff  its a buying opportunity in whatever category has dropped. Most important is to keep an eye on your asset allocation and make sure it is appropriate to your age. You did not state the percentages in each category, so further discussion is impossible on that topic. With more than 15 years to go, I personally would be heavily weighted on the equity side, mostly midcap and some small equity funds or ETFs in both domestic and international markets. As you age, shuffle some equities into fixed income bonds, CDs and the like. Work up an asset allocation plan  start thinking about it now. Dont wait."

    "body": "One reason is that it is not possible at Vanguard and at many other brokerages to autoinvest into ETFs. Because the ETF trades like a stock, you typically must buy a whole number of shares. This makes it difficult to do autoinvesting where you invest, say, a fixed dollar amount each month. If youre investing 100 and the ETF trades for 30 a share, you must either buy 3 shares and leave 10 unspent, or buy 4 and spend 20 more than you planned. This makes autoinvesting with dollar amounts difficult. It would be cool if there were brokerages that handled this for you, for instance by accumulating \"leftover\" cash until an additional whole share could be purchased, but I dont know of any. A difference of 0.12 in the expense ratios is real, but small. It may be outweighed by the psychological gains of being able to adopt a \"handsoff\" autoinvesting plan. With ETFs, you generally must remember to \"manually\" buy the shares yourself every so often. For many average investors, the advantage of being able to invest without having to think about it at all is worth a small increase in expense ratio. The 0.12 savings dont do you any good if you never remember to buy shares until the market is already up."

Of the people in the latter group, there are some who are willing to pay a lot for it. Thats partly because I have a select group rich movie goers and partly because some of these people would be willing to pay more for popcorn with a movie than without. If I were just selling \"popcorn,\" Id have to charge a competitive price. But Im really selling movies, which have more than covered my costs rent, heat, etc. So my costs of selling popcorn are less than that of a nonmovie popcorn seller, and I dont really \"need\" to sell it. Ironically, it means that I can \"take my chances\" and sell a relatively small amount at a high price, thereby maximizing my UNIT profit. I dont mind having people NOT buy popcorn because Ive already made my profit from them with the movie. From the point of view of the consumer, most consumers see popcorn as an \"afterthought.\" They will seldom think, \"I can buy popcorn 2.00 cheaper at Theater A than Theater B, and theres a 20 percent chance that I will want to buy popcorn, so Theater A is 40 cents 2.00.20 cheaper than Theater B.\" Instead, most make the decision to buy the popcorn after theyve arrived at Theater B, because it as \"impulse item.\" And even if they do the \"40 cents\" calculation, Theater B might be selected because other factors convenience, location, etc. outweigh the 40 cent extra cost of popcorn purchased \"sometimes\".

    "body": "In the US, if your monthly statement was issued by the credit card company on January 1 and it showed a balance of 1000, then a payment must be made towards that balance by January 25 or so, not February 1 as you say, to keep the card in good standing. The minimum payment required to keep the card in good standing is specified in your monthly statement, and failure to meet this requirement can trigger various consequences such as an increase in the interest rate charged by the credit card company. With regard to interest charges, whether your purchase of 2000 on January 3 is charged interest or not depends entirely on what happened the previous two months. If you had paid both your monthly statements dated November 1 and December 1 of the previous year in full by the their respective due dates of November 25 and December 25, and the 1000 balance on the January 1 statement is entirely due to purchases no cash advances made in December, then you will not be charged interest on your January purchase of 2000 as long as you pay it off in full by February 25 the charge will appear on your February 1 statement. But, if you had not paid your December 1 statement in full by December 25, then that 1000 billed to you on January 1 will include purchases made during December finance charges on the unpaid balance from the previous month plus finance charges on the purchases made during December. The finance charges will continue to accumulate during January until such time as you pay off the bill in full these charges will appear on your February 1 statement, hopefully by the due date of January 25. But even if you pay off that 1000 in full on January 25, your charge of 2000 on January 3 will start to accumulate finance charges as of the day it hits the account and these finance charges will appear on your February 1 statement. If you paid off that 1000 on January 10, say, then maybe there will be no further finance charges on the 2000 purchase on January 3 after January 10 but now we are getting into the real fine print of what your credit card agreement says. Ditto for the case when you pay off that 1000 on January 2 and made the 2000 charge on January 3. You most likely will not be charged interest on that 2000 charge but again it depends on the fine print. For example, it might say that you will be charged interest on the average of the daily balances for January, but will not be charged interest on purchases during the February cycle unless you miss the February 25 payment and the whole cycle starts all over again. As a general rule, it takes two monthly cycles of payment in full by the due date before one gets into the state of no finance charges for new purchases and effectively an \"interestfree\" loan of 2000 from January 3 date of purchase till February 25 due date of payment. Matters become more complicated when cash advances are taken from a credit card which are charged interest from the day they are taken but dont trigger finance charges on new purchases or the socalled \"zero percent balance transfer offers\" are accepted."

If you deducted this last year, then you need to add in any amount that you received in state income tax refunds last year to your taxes this year, to make up for the fact that you ended up deducting more state income tax than was really due to the state. If you took the standard deduction last year instead of itemizing, then you didnt deduct your state income tax withholding last year and you dont need to claim your refund as income this year. Also, if you itemized, but chose to take the state sales tax deduction instead of the state income tax deduction, you also dont need to add in the refund as income. For whatever reason, Illinois decided that you dont get a 1099G. It might be that the amount of the refund was too small to warrant the paperwork. It might be that they screwed up. But if you deducted your state income tax withholding on last years tax return, then you need to add the state tax refund you got last year on line 10 of this years 1040, whether or not the state issued you a form or not. Take a look at the Line 10 instructions starting on page 22 of the 1040 instructions to see if you have any unusual situations covered there that you didnt mention here. For example, if you received a refund check for multiple years last year. Then check your tax return from last year to verify that you deducted your state income tax withholding on Schedule A.

    "body": "You are forgetting one crucial point regarding the money supply. The US Federal Reserve increases the money supply, meaning some of the money is not really loaned, it just appears out of nowhere. At first glance this seems even worse over the short term, the Fed changes the money supply to help the economy in whatever way it sees fit. But over the long term, the money supply increases to reflect economic growth. As new technology is introduced, more can be accomplished with the same labor and resources, and thus the money supply needs to be increased. Money is really just a convenient replacement for the barter system, so if there are more things to barter \"for\" goods and services then there should also be more things to barter \"with\" money. Also keep in mind inflation. The cost of goods and services goes up over time due to the inflation of currency, and so the money supply must also be increased so that those goods and services do not artificially increase in value, which would be very bad."

    "body": "The Motley Fool suggested a good rule of thumb in one of their articles that may be able to help you determine if the market is overheating. Determine the entire cost of rent for a piece of property. So if rent is 300month, total cost over a year is 3600. Compare that to the cost of buying a similar piece of property by dividing the property price by the rent per year. So if a similar property is 90,000, the ratio would be 90,0003600  25. If the ratio is  20, theres a good chance that the market is overheated. This method is clearly not foolproof, but it helps quantify the irrationality of some individuals who think that buying a place is always better than renting.

If you need access to your capital in the shortterm, 12 years, then it is probably a bad decision. If you have the ability to ride out the next few years, then you may be buying securities at an extremely low valuation. Take AAPL and MSFT for example. These are both technology stocks, which is by far the hottest sector in the economy now, and you can buy both of these companies for less than 13x earnings. Historically, you would have had to pay 20x or higher for high tech growth companies, but today you can buy these stocks at discounted valuations. Now AAPL may have a large market capitalization and a high stock price, but the simple fact is they are growing their earnings very quickly, they have best in class management, and they have 100 billion in cash and 50 billion in annual cash flow generation and you can buy the stock for a historically low multiple."

It is possible for a merchant to attempt to charge you more than you authorized but if they do they risk a fine 2550 for a chargeback from their processor, the legitimate portion of the charge as well as increasing the processing fees charged by their processor or even the possibility of loosing their merchant account entirely and being permanently blacklisted by VisaMastercard. In short no legitimate business is going to intentionally over charge your credit card. There really isnt significant risk in using a reputable online retailers order forms. There is the possibility that their database could be compromised but that risk is lower than the risk of having an employee steal your credit number when you give it to them in person. Besides in the US at least the most you can legally be held liable for is 50 assuming you notice the discrepancy within 60 days of statement the charge appears on and most banks limit liability to 0.

    "body": "The buytorent investment bubble created in some markets a large number of new housing starts often exceeding the available demand. Since people were investing in the capital gain, they didnt mind whether a place was rented or not. Many places stood empty at the prices investors wished to charge. In the UK where building restrictions are so dire that few new houses can be built, new house production is less than market demand which keeps up rental prices. There just isnt any stock. In the US, where construction is more liberal, rental prices can fall as new stock enters the market. A driver will be where the sales market dries up and owners must rent to cover at least some of their mortgage losses. Or, as Joel points out, if a major employer which dominates a small town, leaves. Many old industrial towns feature both low rentals and plenty of empty, lowpriced property. Liverpool, in the UK, features entire empty neighbourhoods all boarded up. If youre looking to track metrics on this simply look at migration patterns.

    "body": "TLDR Sure, \"do your own homework\" is sometimes a cop out. But that doesnt mean we shouldnt do our homework. I agree that in many cases this is a copout by commentators. However, even if you believe in perfect market efficiency, there is benefit in \"doing your homework\" for many reasons. One of which you already mention in the question different stocks all with the same \"value\" might have widely ranging risk. Another factor that might vary between stocks is their tax consequences. High dividend stocks might be a better fit for some buyers than others. One stock might be priced at 40 because there is a small chance they might get regulatory approval for a new product. This might make this stock very risky with a 20 of being 150 in 12 months, and a 80 chance of being 20. Another stock might be priced at 40 because the company is a cash cow, declining in revenues but producing a large dividend of 0.40 per quarter. Low risk, but also with some potential tax disadvantages. Another stock might be priced at 40 because its a high growth stock. This would be less risky than the first example, but more risky than the second example. And the risk would be more generalized, i.e. there wouldnt be one day or one event that would be make or break the stock. In short, even if we assume that the market is pricing everything perfectly, not all stocks are equal and not all stocks are equally appropriate to everyone. Sometimes when we hear an analyst say \"they should have done their homework\" they are really saying \"This was a high riskhigh reward stock. They should have known that this had a potential downside.\" And that all assumes that we believe in 100 pure market efficiency. Which many disagree with, at least to some extent. For example, if we instead subscribe to Peter Lynchs theories about \"local knowledge\", we might believe that everyone has some personal fields of expertise where they know more than the experts. A professional stock analyst is going to follow many stocks and many not have technical experience in the field of the company. This is especially true of small and mid cap stocks. If you happen to be an expert in LED lighting, it is entirely feasible at least to me that you could be able to do a better job of \"doing homework\" on CREE than the analysts. Or if you use a specialized piece of software from a small vendor at work, and you know that the latest version stinks, then you will likely know more than the analyst does. I think it is somewhat akin to going to a doctor. We could say to ourselves \"the doctor is more knowledgeable about me than medicine, Im just going to do what they tell me to do.\" And 99 of the time, that is the right thing to do. But if we do our \"homework\" anyway, and research the symptoms, diagnoses, and drugs ourselves as well, we can do get benefits. Sometimes we just can express our preferences amongst equal solutions. Sometimes we can ask smarter questions. And sometimes we have some piece of knowledge that the doctor doesnt have and can actually make an important discovery they didnt know. And, just like investing, sometimes we can also have just enough knowledge to be dangerous and do ourselves harm if we go against the advice of the professionals."

    "header": "How is the timepremium on PUT options calculated",
    "body": "I asked a friend and he gave me a good explanation, so Im just gonna paste it here for others There is a simple and a complex answer depending on how much you want to understand the pricing dynamic of options. LEAPs dont react 11 with a stock move because the probability of your option being in the money at expiry is still very much up in the air so you basically dont get full credit for a move in the stock this far out from expiry. The more complex answer involves a discussion of option greeks. Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho are variables that affect the pricing of all options. The key greek in this case is Delta because it describes mathematically the expected move of an option as a ratio vs changes in stock price. For put options the ratio is 1 to 0 where 1 is direct correlation between stock price and option price and 0 is no correlation. The Delta increases as an option gets deeper in the money and also as it gets closer to expiry and reflects the probability of the option expiring in the money. For your option contract the current Delta is 0.5673 so 3.38  0.5673  1.9 which is close. Also keep in mind that that strike price had a last trade at 1203 when the stock was at 13.3 and the current ask price is 22.30 so the last price isnt a true reflection of the market value. As for the other greeks, Gamma is a reflection of volatility in the sense that it affects the rate of change of Delta as price and time changes. Theta is the value of the time component of the option and is expressed as the expected time decay per day. The problem is that the time premium is really some arbitrary number that the market maker seems to be able to change at will without justification and it can fluctuate wildly over short periods of time and I think this may explain some of the discrepancy. If you bought the options when AAPL was 118.68 a couple weeks ago option price of 18.85 and now AAPL is at 112.34 and the Delta over that time averaged at 0.55 then your expected option price would be 22.34 118.68  112.34  0.55  18.85  22.34 so you lost around 0.24 in time premium or Theta burn over the last 2 weeks assuming it opens trading around 22.1 on Monday. Your broker should have information about the option contract greeks somewhere. For my platform I have to put the cursor over top of the option contract for it to show me the greeks. If your broker doesnt have this then you can get it from nasdaq.com. This is another reason that I only invest in deep in the money LEAPs because the time premium is much much lower than near the money and also because delta is much higher so if I want to trade out of it early I dont feel like Im getting ripped off not getting paid for a stock price move. For example look at the Jan 17 175 put. The Delta is 0.9 and the time premium is only 01 depending if you are looking at the bid or ask. The only downside is expected returns are lower for deep in the money contracts and they are expensive to buy."

    "body": "Typically a private company is hit by demand supply issues and cost of inputs. In effect at times the cost of input may go up, it cannot raise the prices, because this will reduce demand. However certain public sectors companies, typically in Oil  Engery segements the services are offered by Public sector companies, and the price they charge is governed by Regulatory authorities. In essence the PGE, the agreement for price to customers would be calculated as cost of inputs to PGE, Plus Expenses Plus 11.35 Profit. Thus the regulated price itself governs that the company makes atleast 11.35 profit year on year. Does this mean that the shares are good buy? Just to give an example, say the price was 100 at face value, So essentially by year end logically you would have made 111.35. Assuming the company did not pay dividend ... Now lets say you began trading this share, there would be quite a few people who would say I am ready to pay 200 and even if I get 11.35 [on 200] it still means I have got 6 return. Someone may be ready to pay 400, it still gives 3 ... So in short the price of the stock would keep changing depending how the market percieves the value that a company would return. If the markets are down or the sentiments are down on energy sectors, the prices would go down. So investing in PGE is not a sure shot way of making money.

    "header": "How an ETF pays dividend to shareholders if a holding company issues dividend",
    "body": "The amount, reliability and frequency of dividends paid by an ETF other than a stock, such as an index or mutual fund, is a function of the agreement under which the ETF was established by the managing or issuing company or companies, and the \"basket\" of investments that a share in the fund represents. Lets say you invest in a DJIAbased index fund, for instance Dow Diamonds DIA, which is traded on several exchanges including NASDAQ and AMEX. One share of this fund is currently worth 163.45 Jan 22 2014 1411 CDT while the DJIA itself is 16,381.38 as of the same time, so one share of the ETF represents approximately 1 of the index it tracks. The ETF tracks the index by buying and selling shares of the blue chips proportional to total invested value of the fund, to maintain the same weighted percentages of the same stocks that make up the index. McDonalds, for instance, has an applied weight that makes the share price of MCD stock roughly 5 of the total DJIA value, and therefore roughly 5 of the price of 100 shares of DIA. Now, lets say MCD issued a dividend to shareholders of, say, .20 per share. By buying 100 shares of DIA, you own, through the fund, approximately five MCD shares, and would theoretically be entitled to 1 in dividends. However, keep in mind that you do not own these shares directly, as you would if you spent 16k buying the correct percentage of all the shares directly off the exchange. You instead own shares in the DIA fund, basically giving you an interest in some investment bank that maintains a pool of bluechips to back the fund shares. Whether the fund pays dividends or not depends on the rules under which that fund was set up. The investment bank may keep all the dividends itself, to cover the expenses inherent in managing the fund paying fund management personnel and floor traders, covering losses versus the listed price based on bidask parity, etc, or it may pay some percentage of total dividends received from stock holdings. However, it will virtually never transparently cut you a check in the amount of your proportional holding of an indexed investment as if you held those stocks directly. In the case of the DIA, the fund pays dividends monthly, at a yield of 2.08, virtually identical to the actual weighted DJIA yield 2.09 but lower than the pershare mean yield of the \"DJI 30\" 2.78. Differences between index yields and ETF yields can be reflected in the share price of the ETF versus the actual index 100 shares of DIA would cost 16,345 versus the actual index price of 16,381.38, a delta of 36.38 or 0.2 from the actual index price. That difference can be attributed to many things, but fundamentally its because owning the DIA is not the exact same thing as owning the correct proportion of shares making up the DJIA. However, because of what index funds represent, this difference is very small because investors expect to get the price for the ETF that is inherent in the realtime index."

If so, they should be deducting estimated taxes from your paychecks and sending them in to the government. How much they deduct depends on your salary and what you put down on your W4. Assuming you filled that out accurately, they will withhold an amount that should closely match the taxes you would owe if you took the standard deduction, have no income besides this job, and no unusual deductions. If thats the case, come next April 15 you will probably get a small refund. If you own a small business or are an independent contractor, then you have to estimate the taxes you will owe and make quarterly payments. If youre worried that the amount theyre withholding doesnt sound right, then as GradeEhBacon says, get a copy of last years tax forms or this years if theyre out by now  paper or electronic  fill them out by estimating what your total income will be for the year, etc, and see what the tax comes out to be."

    "header": "I have savings and excess income. Is it time for me to find a financial advisor?",
    "body": "Is my financial status OK? If not, how can I improve it? Im going to concentrate on this question, particularly the first half. Net income 4500 per month Im taking this to be after taxes correct me if wrong. Rent is 1600 and other expenses are up to 800. So lets call that 2500. That leaves you 2000 a month, which is 24,000 a year. You can contribute up to 18,000 a year to a 401k and if you want to maintain your income in retirement, you probably should. The average social security payment now is under 1200. You have an above average income but not a maximum income. So lets set that at 1500. You need an additional income stream of 900 a month in retirement plus enough to cover taxes. Another 5500 for an IRA probably a Roth. Thats 23,500. That leaves you 500 a year of reliable savings for other purposes. Another 5500 for an IRA probably a Roth. Thats 23,500. That leaves you 500 a year of reliable savings for other purposes. You are basically even. Your income is just about what you need to cover expenses and retirement. You could cover a monthly mortgage payment of 1600 and have a 100,000 down payment. That probably gets you around a 350,000 house, although check property taxes. They have to come out of the 1600 a month. That doesnt seem like a lot for a Bay area house even if it would buy a mansion in rural Mississippi. Perhaps think condo instead. Try to keep at least 15,000 to 27,000 as emergency savings. If you lose your job or get stuck with a required expense e.g. a major house repair, youll need that money. You dont have enough income to support a car unless it saves you money somewhere. 500 a year is probably not going to cover insurance, parking, gas, and maintenance. Its possible that you could tighten up your expenses, but in my experience, people are more likely to underestimate their expenses than overestimate. Thats why Im saying 2500 a little above the high end rather than 2000 your low end estimate. If things are stable, wait a year and evaluate. Track your actual spending. Ask yourself if you made any large purchases. Your budget should include an appliance TV, refrigerator, washerdryer, etc. a year. If youre not paying for that now included in rent?, then you need to allow for it in your ownership budget. I do not consider an ESPP to be a reliable investment vehicle. Consider the Enron possibility. You wake up one day and find out that there is no actual money. Your stock is now worthless. A diversified portfolio can survive this. If you lose your job and your investment, youll be stuck with just your savings. Hopefully you didnt just tie them up in a house that you might have to sell to take your next job in a different location. An ESPP might work as savings for the house. If something goes wrong, dont buy the house. But its not retirement or emergency savings. I would say that you are OK but could be better. Get your retirement savings started. That does two things. One, it gives you money for retirement. Two, it keeps you from having extra money now when it is easy to develop expensive habits. An abrupt drop from 4500 in spending to 1200 will hurt. A smooth transition from 2500 to 2500 is what you would like to see. You are behind now, but you have the opportunity to catch up for a few years. Work out how much youll get from Social Security and how much you need to cover your typical expenses with the occasional emergency. Expect high health care costs in retirement. Medicare covers a lot but not everything, and health care is only getting more expensive. Dont forget to assume higher taxes in the future to help cover that expense and the existing debt. After a few years of catch up contributions, work out your long term plan assuming a reasonable real after inflation rate of return. If you can reduce the 23,500 in retirement contributions then, thats OK. But be pessimistic. Most people overestimate good things and underestimate bad things. Its much better to have extra than not enough. A 401k comes with an administrator and your choice of mutual funds. Try for diversification. Some money in bonds 25 to 30. The remainder in stocks. Look for index funds. Try for a mix of value and growth, as theyll do better at different times. As you approach retirement, you can convert some of that into shorter term, lower yield investments. The rough rule of thumb is to have two to five years of withdrawals in short term investments like money market funds. But thats more than twenty years off. You have more choices with an IRA. In particular, you can choose your own administrator. But Id keep the same stockbond mix and stick to index funds if youre not interested in researching the more complex options. You may want to invest your IRA in a growth fund and your 401k in value funds and bonds. Then balance the stockbond mix across both. When you invest each year, look at the underrepresented funds and add the most to them. So if bonds had a bad year and didnt keep pace, invest in bonds. Theyre probably cheap. You dont want to rebalance frequently, but once a year might be a good pace. Thats about how often you should invest in an IRA, so that can be a good time. Ill let the others answer on the financial advisor part."

I think youll generate more shared happiness by acting as a team of equals. Id pool your resources and share them as equals. Id open a joint account and pay both your incomes directly into it. Id pay all household bills from this. If you feel the need, have separate personal savings accounts paid into equally from the joint account. Major assets should be in joint names. This usually means the house. In my experience, it is a good idea to each have a small amount of individual savings that you jointly agree each can spend without consulting the other, even if the other thinks it is a shocking waste of money. However, spending of joint savings should only be by mutual agreement. I would stop worrying about who is bringing in the most income. Are you planning to gestate your children? How much is that worth?  My advice is to put all this aside, stop trying to track who adds what value to the joint venture and make it a partnership of equals where each contributes whatever they can. Suppose you fell ill and were unable to earn. Should you wife then retain all her income and keep you in poverty? I really believe life is simpler and happier without adding complex and stressful financial issues to the relationship. Of course, everyone is different.

Losses in excess of this limit can be carried forward to later years to reduce capital gains or ordinary income until the balance of these losses is used up. This means that your harvested losses can be used to offset ordinary income  up to 3000 in a single year, and with extra losses carried forward to future years. It is pretty close to a free lunch, provided that you have some losses somewhere in your portfolio. This free lunch is available to anyone, but for a human, it can be quite a chore to decide when to sell what, keep track of the losses, and avoid the wash sale rules.

    "body": "why should I have any bias in favour of my local economy? The main reason is because your expenses are in the local currency. If you are planning on spending most of your money on foreign travel, thats one thing. But for most of us, the bulk of our expenses are incurred locally. So it makes sense for us to invest in things where the investment return is local. You might argue that you can always exchange foreign results into local currency, and thats true. But then you have two risks. One risk youll have anywhere your investments may go down. The other risk with a foreign investment is that the currency may lose value relative to your currency. If that happens, even a good performing investment can go down in terms of what it can return to you. That fund denominated in your currency is really doing these conversions behind the scenes. Unless the bulk of your purchases are from imports and have prices that fluctuate with your currency, you will probably be better off in local investments. As a rough rule of thumb, your countrys import percentage is a good estimate of how much you should invest globally. That looks to be about 20 for Australia. So consider something like 50 local stocks, 20 local bonds, 15 foreign stocks, 5 foreign bonds, and 10 local cash. That will insulate you a bit from a weak local currency while not leaving you out to dry with a strong local currency. Its possible that your particular expenses might be more or less vulnerable to foreign price fluctuations than the typical. But hopefully this gives you a starting point until you can come up with a way of estimating your personal vulnerability."

Having more than card has helped me when getting special offers multiple times from some websites where it was limited to \"one per customer\" though most just used your address or email account. If you owed 1000 in total which you cant pay off in one go, it is better to have that split across two cards. You would be paying interest on 500 on each card but when you have one card paid off, the interest you would be paying on the other would be based on the original debt to that one card of 500 not 1000.

    "body": "Properties do in fact devaluate every year for several reasons. One of the reasons is that an old property is not the state of the art and cannot therefore compete with the newest properties, e.g. energy efficiency may be outdated. Second reason is that the property becomes older and thus it is more likely that it requires expensive repairs. I have read somewhere that the real value depreciation of properties if left practically unmaintained i.e. only the repairs that have to absolutely be performed are made is about 2 per year, but do not remember the source right now. However, Properties or more accurately, the tenants do pay you rent, and it is possible in some cases that rent more than pays for the possible depreciation in value. For example, you could ask whether car leasing is a poor business because cars depreciate in value. Obviously it is not, as the leasing payments more than make for the value depreciation. However, I would not recommend properties as an investment if you have only small sums of money. The reasons are manyfold So, as a summary for large investors property investments may be a good idea because large investors have the ability to diversify. However, large investors often use debt leverage so it is a very good question why they dont simply invest in stocks with no debt leverage. For small investors, property investments do not often make sense. If you nevertheless do property investments, remember the diversification, also in time. So, purchase different kinds of properties and purchase them in different times. Putting a million USD to properties at one point of time is very risky, because property prices can rise or fall as time goes on."

    "body": "No, they do not. Stock funds and bonds funds collect income dividends in different ways. Stock funds collect dividends as well as any capital gains that are realized from the underlying stocks and incorporates these into the funds net asset value, or daily share price. Thats why a stock funds share price drops when the fund makes a distribution  the distribution comes out of the funds total net assets. With bond funds, the internal accounting is different Dividends accrue daily, and are then paid out to shareholders every month or quarter. Bond funds collect the income from the underlying bonds and keep it in a separate internal bucket. A bond fund calculates a daily accrual rate for the shares outstanding, and shareholders only earn income for the days they actually hold the fund. For example, if you buy a bond fund two days before the funds monthend distribution, you would only receive two days worth of income that month. On the other hand, if you sell a fund partway through the month, you will still receive a partial distribution at the end of the month, prorated for the days you actually held the fund. Source Also via bogleheads Most Vanguard bond funds accrue interest to the share holders daily. Here is a typical statement from a prospectus Each Fund distributes to shareholders virtually all of its net income interest less expenses as well as any net capital gains realized from the sale of its holdings. The Funds income dividends accrue daily and are distributed monthly. The term accrue used in this sense means that the income dividends are credited to your account each day, just like interest in a savings account that accrues daily. Since the money set aside for your dividends is both an asset of the fund and a liability, it does not affect the calculated net asset value. When the fund distributes the income dividends at the end of the month, the net asset value does not change as both the assets and liabilities decrease by exactly the same amount. [Note that if you sell all of your bond fund shares in the middle of the month, you will receive as proceeds the value of your shares calculated as number of shares times net asset value plus a separate distribution of the accrued income dividends.]"

If its just a oneoff or occasional thing for personal reasons, rather than being done in the course of a business, there probably arent any tax implications. In theory if theres an identifiable profit from the transaction, e.g. because you originally obtained the INR at a lower exchange rate, then you might be liable to capital gains tax. However this is only payable above approximately 10K capital gains see httpwww.hmrc.gov.ukratescgt.htm so unless this is a very large transaction or you have other gains in the tax year, you dont need to worry about that. I would only recommend doing this if you trust each other. If one side transfers the money and the other doesnt, the international nature will make it quite hard in practice to enforce the agreement legally, even though I think that in theory it should be possible. If the sums involved are large, you may find that the transaction is automatically reported to the authorities by your bank under money laundering regulations, or they may want documentation of the source of the fundsreason for the transaction. This doesnt automatically mean youll have a problem, but the transaction may receive some scrutiny. I think that reporting typically kicks in when several thousand pounds are involved."

If you can sell it before any price drop, then you are guaranteed to make 15 on the money invested minus any commissions. Some employers make ESPP participants hold the stock for a year. This makes such a plan less of a value. The reasons are the stock can drop in price during that time, you could need the money, or in the best case your money is tied up longer making the ROI less.

Another way of putting that is that in practice you only get the tax brackets allocated proportionately throughout the year  so up till the end of August youll only have been assigned 812 of the 37450 bracket, and so on. So if your income doesnt change and your general tax affairs dont change, your paycheck also shouldnt change. If your income is irregular or changes during the year then things can get more complicated. As other answers have noted, withholdings are calculated according to tables that normally just take into account that specific months income. There are various possible changes to your tax affairs that might cause the withholdings to change. For example thered be an impact from any change in your contributions to tax advantaged things like health insurance or retirement, health or education savings. You might also use form W4 to change your withholdings yourself. Note that even with a regular income that doesnt change through the year, you might find yourself either owing money or being owed a refund when you file your taxes after the end of the year. Its worth making sure that your W4 accurately records the allowances you are entitled to, to minimize or eliminate this adjustment."

    "body": "As documented in MyFICO httpwww.myfico.comcrediteducationwhatsinyourcreditscore, there are several factors that affect credit scores. Payment history 35 The first thing any lender wants to know is whether youve paid past credit accounts on time. This is one of the most important factors in a FICO Score. As Ben Miller mentioned, checking your credit report to determine whether or not late payments were reported to credit bureaus will give you a sense of whether or not this was effected. You mentioned several bounced payments, which certainly could have caused this. This would be my largest concern with a closed account, is to investigate why and what was reported to the bureaus, and in turn, other lenders. Also, since this has the highest impact on credit scores 35, its arguably, the most important. This is further detailed here, which details the public record and late payment effect on your score. Amounts owed 30 Having credit accounts and owing money on them does not necessarily mean you are a highrisk borrower with a low FICO Score....However, when a high percentage of a persons available credit is been used, this can indicate that a person is overextended, and is more likely to make late or missed payments. Given that this card was closed, whatever your credit limit was is now no longer added into your total credit limit. However, your utilization on that card is gone assuming it gets paid off, depending on any other credit lines, and since you reported \"heavy use\" that could be a positive impact, though likely not. Length of credit history 15 In general, a longer credit history will increase your FICO Scores. However, even people who havent been using credit long may have high FICO Scores, depending on how the rest of the credit report looks. Depending how old your card was, and particularly since this was your only credit card, it will likely impact your average age of credit lines, depending on other lines of credit loans etc you have open. This accounts for about 15 of your score, so not as large of an impact as the first two. Credit mix in use 10 FICO Scores will consider your mix of credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, finance company accounts and mortgage loans. Given that this was your only credit card, your loan mix has been reduced possibly to none. New credit 10 Research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period of time represents a greater risk  especially for people who dont have a long credit history. This focuses on credit inquiries, which as you mentioned, you will likely have another either reopening this credit card or opening another at some point in the future. Regardless, paying off the rest of that card is a priority, as interest rates on average credit cards are over 13, and often higher source. This rate comes into play when not paying the balance in full every month, and also as Ben Miller suggested, I would not utilize a credit card without being able to pay it in full. It can often be a dangerous cycle of debt."

    "header": "Investing Superannuation Australia",
    "body": "You can make a start to learn how to make better investing decisions by learning and understanding what your current super funds are invested in. Does the super fund give you choices of where you can invest your funds, and how often does it allow you to change your investment choices each year? If you are interested in one area of investing over others, eg property or shares, then you should learn more on this subject, as you can also start investing outside of superannuation. Your funds in superannuation are taxed less but you are unable to touch them for another 30 to 35 years. You also need to consider investing outside super to help meet your more medium term goals and grow your wealth outside of super as well. If you are interested in shares then I believe you should learn about both fundamental and technical analysis, they can help you to make wiser decisions about what to invest in and when to invest. Above is a chart of the ASX200 over the last 20 years until January 2015. It shows the Rate Of Change ROC indicator below the chart. This can be used to make medium to long term decisions in the stock market by investing when the ROC is above zero and getting out of the market when the ROC is below zero. Regarding your aggressiveness in your investments, most would say that yes because you are still young you should be aggressive because you have time on your side, so if there is a downturn in your investments then you still have plenty of time for them to recover. I have a different view, and I will use the stock market as an example. Refer back to the chart above, I would be more aggressive when the ROC is above zero and less aggressive when the ROC is below zero. How can you relate this to your super fund? If it does provide you to change your investment choices, then I would be invested in more aggressive investments like shares when the ROC crosses above zero, and then when the ROC moves below zero take a less aggressive approach by moving your investments in the super fund to a more balanced or capital guaranteed strategy where less of your funds are invested in shares and more are invested in bonds and cash. You can also have a similar approach with property. Learn about the property cycles remember super funds usually invest in commercial and industrial property rather than houses, so you would need to learn about the commercial and industrial property cycles which would be different to the residential property cycle. Regarding your question about SMSFs, if you can increase your knowledge and skills in investing, then yes switching to a SMSF will give you more control and possibly better returns. However, I would avoid switching your funds to a SMSF right now. Two reasons, firstly you would want to increase your knowledge as mentioned above, and secondly you would want to have at least 300,000 in funds before switching to a SMSF or else the setup and compliance costs would be too high as a percentage of your funds at the moment 70,000. You do have time on your side, so whilst you are increasing your funds you can use that time to educate yourself in your areas of interest. And remember a SMSF is not only an investment vehicle whilst you are building your funds during your working life, but it is also an investment vehicle when you are retired and it becomes totally tax free during this phase, where any investment returns are tax free and any income you take out is also tax free."

    "header": "Why are capital gains taxed at a lower rate than normal income? ",
    "body": "There are many reasons, which other answers have already discussed. I want to emphasize and elaborate on just one of the reasons, which is that it avoids double taxation, especially on corporate earnings. Generally, for corporations, its earnings are already taxed at around 40 for the US  including State income taxes. When dividends are distributed out, it is taxed again at the individual level. The effect is the same when equity is sold and the distribution is captured as a capital gain. I believe this is why the dividend and capital gain rates are the same in the US. For a simplistic example, say there is a C Corporation with a single owner. The company earns 1,000,000 before income taxes. It pays 400,000 in taxes, and has retained earnings of 600,000. To get the money out, the owner can either distribute a dividend to herself, or sell her stake to another person. Either choice leads to 600,000 getting taxed at another 2030 or so at the individual level depending on the State. If we calculate the effective rate, it is above 50! Many people invest in stock, including mutual funds, and the dividends and capital gains are taxed at lower rates. Individual tax returns that contain no wage income often have very low average tax rates for this reason. However, the investments themselves are continuously paying out their own taxes, or accruing taxes in the form of future tax liability."

    "body": "The decision as to what counts as income is up to the bank. Youll need to ask them whether or not rental income can be included in the total. I can offer some anecdotal evidence when I applied for a mortgage to buy my home, I already had a rental property with a buytolet mortgage on it. Initially the bank regarded that property as a liability, not an asset, because it was mortgaged! However, once I was able to show that there was a good history of receiving enough rent, they chose to ignore the property altogether  i.e. it wasnt regarded as a liability, but it wasnt regarded as a source of income either. More generally, as AakashM says, residential mortgages are computed based on affordability, which is more than just a multiple of your salary. To answer your specific questions Covered above its up to the bank. If youre married, and you dont have a written tenancy agreement, and youre not declaring the \"rent\" on your tax return, then it seems unlikely that this would be regarded as income at all. Conversely, if your partner is earning, why not put their name on the mortgage application too? Buytolet mortgages are treated differently. While it used to be the case that they were assessed on rental income only, nowadays lenders may ask for proof of the landlords income from other sources. Note that a BTL cannot be used for a property you intend to live in, and a residential mortgage cannot be used for a property you intend to let to tenants  at least, not without the banks permission."

HFT has been debated heavily over the past couple of years, and the Flash crash of May 6, 2010, has spurred regulators to rein in heavy automated trading. HFT takes advantage of churn and split second reactions to changing market trends, news and rumors. It is not wise for individual investors to fight the big boys in these games and you will likely lose money in day trading as a result. HFTs defenders may be right when they claim that it makes the market more liquid for you to get the listed price for a security, but the article points out that their actions more closely resemble the currently illegal practice of frontrunning than a negotiated trade where both parties feel that theyve received a fair value. There are many factors including supply and demand which affect stock prices more than volume does. While market makers are generating the majority of volume with their HFT practices, volume is merely the number of shares bought and sold in a day. Volume shows how many shares people are interested in trading, not the actual underlying value of the security and its long term prospects. Extra volume doesnt affect most long term investments, so your long term investments arent in any extra danger due to HFT. That said, the stock market is a risky place whether panicked people or poorly written programs are trading out of control. Most people are better off investing rather than merely trading. Long term investors dont need to get the absolute lowest price or the highest sell. They move into and out of positions based on overall value and long term prospects. Theyre diversified so bad apples like Enron, etc. wont destroy their portfolio. Investors long term view allows them to ignore the effects of churn, while working like the tortoise to win the race while the hare eventually gets swallowed by a bad bet.

    "body": "The link provided by DumbCoder below is only relevant to UK resident investors and does not apply if you live in Malaysia. I noticed that in a much older question you asked a similar question about taxes on US stocks, so Ill try and answer both situations here. The answer is almost the same for any country you decide to invest in. As a foreign investor, the country from which you purchase stock cannot charge you tax on either income or capital gains. Taxation is based on residency, so even when you purchase foreign stock its the tax laws of Malaysia as your country of residence that matter. At the time of writing, Malaysia does not levy any capital gains tax and there is no income tax charged on dividends so you wont have to declare or pay any tax on your stocks regardless of where you buy them from. The only exception to this is Dividend Withholding Tax, which is a special tax taken by the government of the country you bought the stock from before it is paid to your account. You do not need to declare this tax as it his already been taken by the time you receive your dividend. The rate of DWT that will be withheld is unique to each country. The UK does not have any withholding tax so you will always receive the full dividend on UK stocks. The withholding tax rate for the US is 30. Other countries vary. For most countries that do charge a withholding tax, it is possible to have this reduced to 15 if there is a double taxation treaty in place between the two countries and all of the following are true Note Although the taxation rules of both countries are similar, I am a resident of Singapore not Malaysia so I cant speak from first hand experience, but current Malaysia tax rates are easy to find online. The rest of this information is common to any nonUSUK resident investor as long as youre not a US person."

    "header": "How does unemployment insurance work?",
    "body": "Unemployment insurance provides a temporary safety net to workers who lose their jobs by replacing a portion of their salary for certain periods. Each state administers its own unemployment insurance program so some rules may vary from state to state. To receive unemployment insurance payments, you must have lost your job through no fault of your own. If you quit your job or lost it because of poor performance or another justifiable reason, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. State unemployment insurance programs require claimants to have worked sufficiently before they can claim benefits. As soon as you apply for unemployment insurance, an agency with the state in which you live will verify that you were a victim of a layoff by contacting your previous employer and making sure you lost your job due to lack of work and not an action within your control. After the state verifies you were indeed the victim of a layoff, your weekly payment is calculated. Your payment will be a percentage of what you made in your previous job, generally between 20 percent and 50 percent, depending on your state. Unemployment insurance replaces only a portion of your previous pay because it is intended to pay only for the essentials of living such as food and utilities until you find new employment. Before you begin receiving benefits, you must complete a waiting period of typically one or two weeks. If you find a new job during this period, you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits, even if the job does not pay you as much as your previous job. After the waiting period, you will begin to receive your weekly payments. Employers pay for unemployment insurance through payroll taxes. So, while employees work and earnings history are important to funding their unemployment benefits, the money does not come from their pay. Employer unemployment insurance contributions depend on several factors, including how many former employees have received benefits. Employers pay taxes on an employees base wages, which vary by state. California, for example taxes employers on the first 7,000 of an employees annual earnings, while neighboring Oregon taxes up to 32,000 of wages. Employers must set aside funds each payroll period and then report taxes and pay their states quarterly. States have several categories of tax rates they charge employers. New businesses and those first adding employees pay the \"new rate,\" which is typically lower and geared toward small businesses. Established businesses who havent paid their taxes recently or properly are usually assessed the \"standard rate\"  the highest possible tax rate, which in 2010 ranged from 5.4 percent in several states including Georgia, Hawaii and Alaska to 13.56 percent in Pennsylvania. Businesses in good standing may receive discounts under the \"experienced rate.\" Depending on the number of employees a business has and how many former employees have claimed unemployment, states can give sizable rate reductions. The fewer claims, the lower the rate a business pays in unemployment insurance taxes. As a result of the economic crisis legislation has been passed to extend Unemployment benefits. Regular unemployment benefits are paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states. However, additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits are available during times of high unemployment. The unemployment extension legislation passed by Congress in February 2012 changed the way the tiers of Emergency Unemployment Compensation EUC are structured. A tier of unemployment is an extension of a certain amount of weeks of unemployment benefits. There are currently four tiers of unemployment benefits. Each tier provides extra weeks of unemployment in addition to basic state unemployment benefits.

So, lets say you have 5000 in savings, as an emergency fund. Of the top of my head, putting some of it into a Roth IRA could backfire in the following ways The basic principle here is that the stock market is not a good place for storing your emergency cash, which needs to be secured against loss and immediately accessible. Once youre happy with your level of emergency cash, however, taxadvantaged investment accounts are a reasonable next step."

    "header": "Why buying an inverse ETF does not give same results as shorting the ETF",
    "body": "The most fundamental answer is that when you short a stock or an ETF, you short a specific number of shares on a specific day, and you probably dont adjust this much as the price wobbles goes up and down. But an inverse fund is not tied to a specific start date, like your own transaction is. It adjusts on an ongoing basis to maintain its full specified leverage at all times. If the underlying index goes up, it has to effectively \"buy in\" because its collateral is no longer sufficient to support its open position. On the other hand, if the underlying index goes down, that frees up collateral which is used to effectively shortsell more of the underlying. So by design it will buy high and sell low, and so any volatility will pump money out of the fund. I say \"effectively\" because inverse funds use derivatives and contracts, rather than actually shorting the underlying security. Which brings up the less fundamental issue. These derivatives and contracts are relatively opaque the counterparties are in it for their own benefit, not yours and the people who run the fund get their expenses regardless of how you do, and they are hard for you to monitor. This is a hazardous combination."

    "body": "If you want to make a profit from long term trading whatever \"long term\" means for you, the best strategy is to let the good performers in your portfolio run, and cull the bad ones. Of course that strategy is hard to follow, unless you have the perfect foresight to know exactly how long your best performing investments will continue to outperform the market, but markets dont always follow the assumption that perfect information is available to all participants, and hence \"momentum\" has a realworld effect on prices, whether or not some theorists have chosen to ignore it. But a fixed strategy of \"daily rebalancing\" does exactly the opposite of the above  it continuously reduces the holdings of good performers and increases the holdings of bad. If this type of rebalancing is done more frequently than the constituents of benchmark index are adjusted, it is very likely to underperform the index in the long term. Other issues in a \"real world\" market are the impact of increased dealing costs on smaller parcels of securities, and the buysell spreads incurred in the daily rebalancing trades. If the market is up and down 1 on alternate days with no long tern trend, quite likely the fund will be repeatedly buying and selling small parcels of the same stocks to do its daily balancing."

Ive no experience with bidding. I dont understand whats happening at all An auction is a way to sell something. Instead of offering it for sale at a fixed price, you offer it to the highest bidder. Someone e.g. Google says, \"Ill offer you [some amount e.g. a million dollars] for it.\" If noone else exceeds that bid, then you say sold and Google has bought it. Alternatively someone else comes along with a higher bid, \"Ill offer you two million dollars for it,\" in which case theyre the new high bidder, and youll sell it to them unless the process repeats itself with anyone counteroffering an even higher bid. See also httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAuction and httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSpectrumauction The \"Disadvantages\" section of this article alleges currently without a citation that Despite the apparent success of spectrum auctions, an important disadvantage limiting both efficiency and revenues is demand reduction and collusive bidding. The information and flexibility in the process of auction can be used to reduce auction prices by tacit collusion. When bidder competition is weak and one bidder holds an apparent advantage to win the auction for specific licenses, other bidders will often choose not to the bid for higher prices, hence reducing the final revenue generated by the auction.[citation needed] In this case, the auction is best thought of as a negotiation among the bidders, who agree on who should win the auction for each discrete bit of spectrum. Googles bid made that impossible or, at least, ensured that the winning bid would be at least as high as the minimum which was set by Googles bid."

    "header": "Highrisk investing is better for the young? Why?",
    "body": "Im going to diverge from most of the opinions expressed here. It is common for financial advisors to assume that your portfolio should become less risky as you get older. Explanations for this involve handwaving and saying that you can afford to lose money when young because you have time to make up for it later. However, the idea that portfolios should become less risky as you get older is not wellgrounded in finance theory. According to finance theory, regardless of your age and wealth, returns are desirable and risk is undesirable. Your risk aversion is the only factor that should decide how much risk you put in your portfolio. Do people become more risk averse as they get older? Sometimes. Not always. In fact, there are theoretical reasons why people might want more aggressive portfolios as they age. For example As people become wealthier they generally become less risk averse. Young people are not normally very wealthy. When you are young, most of your wealth is tied up in the value of your human capital. This wealth shifts into your portfolio as you age. Depending on your field, human capital can be extremely riskymuch riskier than the market. Therefore to maintain anything like a constant risk profile over your life, you may want very safe investments when young. You mention being a hedge fund manager. If we enter a recession, your human capital will take a huge hit because you will have a hard time raising money or gettingkeeping a job. No one will value your skills and your future career prospects will fall. You will not want the double whammy of large losses in your portfolio. Hedge fund managers are clear examples of people who will want a very safe personal portfolio during their early working years and may be willing to invest very aggressively in their later working and early retirement years. In short, the received wisdom that portfolios should start out risky and get safer as we age is not always, and perhaps not even usually, true. A better guide to how much risk you should have in your portfolio is how you respond to questions that directly measure your risk aversion. This questions ask things like how much you would pay to avoid the possibility of a 20 loss in your portfolio with a certain probability."

Covered call writing is often used to generate premium income from a stock portfolio, and less as a tool for speculation. Buying a call or put is simpler in execution, but the risk of losing the entire amount spent I actually avoid the word invested here due to leverage involved isnt just a possibility  it can be pretty likely depending on the strike price. Put writing and uncovered naked call writing can entail even higher risk relative to the premium received  consider extreme moves in the underlying to understand the potential losses involved.

    "body": "Hedging  You have an investment and are worried that the price might drop in the near future. You dont want to sell as this will realise a capital gain for which you may have to pay capital gains tax. So instead you make an investment in another instrument sometimes called insurance to offset falls in your investment. An example may be that you own shares in XYZ. You feel the price has risen sharply over the last month and is due for a steep fall. So you buy some put option over XYZ. You pay a small premium and if the price of XYZ falls you will lose money on the shares but will make money on the put option, thus limiting your losses. If the price continues to go up you will only lose the premium you paid for the option very similar to an insurance policy. Diversification  This is when you may have say 100,000 to invest and spread your investments over a portfolio of shares, some units in a property fund and some bonds. So you are spreading your risks and returns over a range of products. The idea is if one stock or one sector goes down, you will not lose a large portion of your investment, as it is unlikely that all the different sectors will all go down at the same time."

The difference was that the dealer agreed to finance and the bank they used wanted a higher interest rate from me because of my limited credit history. The dealer asked for a rate 5 percentage points higher than what they put on the paperwork. I told them that I would not pay that and I dropped the car off at the lot with a letter rescinding the sale. They werent happy about that and eventually offered me financing at my original rate with a 1000 discount from the previously agreedupon purchase price. What I learned through that experience is that I didnt do a goodenough job of negotiating the original price. I would suggest that your son stop answering phone calls from the dealership for at least 1 week and drive the car as much as possible in that time. If the dealer has cashed the check then that will be the end of it. He owes nothing further. If the dealer has not cashed the check, he should ask whether they prefer to keep the check or if they want the car with 1000 miles on the odometer.

    "body": "For the future NEVER buy a car based on the payment. When dealers start negotiating, they always try to have you focus on the monthly payment. This allows them to change the numbers for your trade, the price they are selling the car for, etc so that they maximize the amount of money they can get. To combat this you need to educate yourself on how much total money you are willing to spend for the vehicle, then, if you need financing, figure out what that actually works out to on a monthly basis. NEVER take out a 6 year loan. Especially on a used car. If you cant afford a used car with at most a 3 year note paying cash is much better then you cant really afford that car. The longer the note term, the more money you are throwing away in interest. You could have simply bought a much cheaper car, drove it for a couple years, then paid CASH for a newer one with the money you saved. Now, as to the amount you are \"upside down\" and that you are looking at new cars. 1400 isnt really that bad. note Yes you were taken to the cleaners. Someone mentioned that banks will sometimes loan up to 20 above MSRP. This is true depending on your credit, but its a very bad idea because you are purposely putting yourself in the exact same position worse actually. However, you shouldnt need to worry about that. It is trivial to negotiate such that you pay less than sticker for a new car while trading yours in, even with that deficit. Markup on vehicles is pretty insane. When I sold, it was usually around 20 for foreign and up to 30 for domestic that leaves a lot of wiggle room. When buying a used car, most dealers ask for at least 3k more than what they bought them for... Sometimes much more than that depending on blue book loan value or what they managed to talk the previous owner out of. Either way, a purchase can swallow that 1400 without making it worse. Buy accordingly."

Joint liability means the company and employee share the responsibility for payments, says Mahendra Gupta, author of the RPMG survey. In both cases, if the card isnt paid and the account becomes delinquent, it will pop up on the employees credit report and dent his or her credit score, says Barry Paperno, consumer affairs manager at myFICO.com. It doesnt matter if the company was supposed to make the payment the repercussions fall on the employee. \"It will impact your score no differently than if you were late on one of your own accounts,\" Paperno says. Usually, with corporate credit cards, the employee is liable along with the employer for charges on the card. The intent is to provide the employee with an incentive not to misuse the card. However, this can be a problem if your company is late in paying bills. In the distant past, I had a corporate credit card. I was not supposed to have to pay the bill, but I did receive a bill in the mail every month. And occasionally, the payment was late. In my case, these late payments never showed up on my credit report. I cant remember now whether or not this card was reported on my credit report at all. And I remember being told when I got the card that I was jointly responsible for the card with the company. However, your experience may be different.

Rental cars are typically driven by people over 25, these are typically people with some financial means air travel, credit card. Additionally, rental cars are subject to frequent inspection and likely to be on tighter maintenance schedules than many owners would keep. So while some people may drive a rental harder than they would their own car, its not typical, and not likely to result in some hidden damage that makes a rental less desirable all else being equal on the usedcar market. Does the fact that they sell the car mean during this time suggest that they know the cars cost of further maintenance or other costs will be higher? Or is there another reason they sell at this time which, has a calculated advantage to them, but which is less than idea statistically for me, the purchaser? Rental companies buy at incredible volumes, as such, some manufacturers have programs where they will buy back used cars from the rental company at a set price andor time. Other incentives are guaranteed depreciation, wherein the manufacturer will make up the difference if the used vehicle doesnt sell for a set percentage of its purchase price after a set amount of time. Outside of these incentive programs, rental companies also get substantial volume discounts, and they typically are buying base models which hold value better than their highertrim counterparts according to KBB market analyst. So the conventional wisdom about depreciation doesnt really apply. The timing of their sales is primarily based on their purchasing arrangements and their desire to keep an up to date fleet, not on projected maintenancerepair costs. The best you can do with any usedcar purchase is to testdrive, get a prepurchase inspection, and review whatever history is available."

    "body": "A bank is insolvent when it can no longer meet its shortterm obligations. In this example, the bank is insolvent when depositors withdraw more cash than the bank can pay out. In this case, its probably something in the range of 600700k, because the bank can borrow money from other banks using assets as collateral. In the US, we manage this risk in a few ways. First, FDIC insurance provides a level of assurance that in a worstcase scenario, most depositors will have access to their money guaranteed by the government. This prevents bank panics and reduces the demand for cash. The risk that remains is the risk that you brought up in your scenario  bad debt or investments that are valued inappropriately. We mitigate this risk by giving the Federal Reserve and in some instances the US Treasure the ability to provide nearly unlimited capital to get over shortmidterm issues brought on by the market. In cases of longterm, structural issues with the bank balance sheets, regulators like the FDIC, Federal Reserve and others have the ability to assume control of the bank and sell off its assets to other, stronger institutions. The current financial regime has its genesis in the bank panics of the 1890s, when the shift from an agricultural based economy where no capital is available until the crops come in! to an industrial economy revealed the weakness of the unregulated model where ad hoc groups of banks backed each other up. Good banks were being destroyed by panics until a trusted third party JP Morgan stepped in, committed capital and make personal guarantees."

    "body": "The everyday investor buys at the ask and sells at the bid but the market maker does the opposite This is misleading it has nothing to do with being either an investor or a market maker. It is dependent on the type of order that is submitted. When a market trades at the ask, this means that a buy market order has interacted with a sell limit order at the limit price. When a market trades at the bid, this means that a sell market order has interacted with a buy limit order at the limit price. An ordinary investor can do exactly the same as a market maker and submit limit orders. Furthermore, they can sit on both sides of the bid and ask exactly as a market maker does. In the days before high frequency trading this was quite common an example being Daytek, whose traders were notorious for stepping in front of the designated market makers bidask on the Island ECN. An order executes ONLY when both bid and ask meet. bid  ask This is completely incorrect. A transaction occurs when an active marketable order is matched with a passive limit book order. If the passive order is a sell limit then the trade has occurred at the ask, and if it is a buy limit the trade has occurred at the bid. The active orders are not bids and asks. The only exception to this would be if the bid and ask have become crossed. When a seller steps in, he does so with an ask thats lower than the stocks current ask Almost correct he does so with an order thats lower than the stocks current ask. If its a marketable order it will fill the front queued best bid, and if its a limit order his becomes the new ask price. A trade does not need to occur at this price for it to become the ask. This is wrong, market makers are the opposite party to you so the prices are the other way around for them. This is wrong. There is no distinction between the market maker and yourself or any other member of the public beside the fact that designated market makers on some exchanges are obliged to post both a bid and ask at all times. You can open an account with any broker and do exactly the same as a market maker does although with nothing like the speed that a high frequency marketmaking firm can, hence likely making you uncompetitive in this arena.

    "body": "You must understand that So, if you  the prospective buyer  are in Waukegan, do you take the train all the way to New York City just to buy 100 shares of stock? No. That would be absurdly expensive. So, you hire an agent in NYC who will broker a deal for you in the exchange. Fast forward 100 years, to the time when instant communications is available. Why do we now still need brokerages, when the Exchanges could set up web sites and let you do the trading? The answer is that the Exchanges dont want to have to develop the accounting systems to manage the transactions of hundreds of thousands of small traders, when existing brokerage firms already have those computerized processes in place and are opening their own web sites. Thus, in 2017 we have brokerage firms because of history."

The former is a liquid way of stashing some money away IOW you can get at it pretty much any time you want whereas the latter is extremely illiquid you only get your money back if and when the loan has been repaid. Also, as mentioned by the other posters, there is a risk attached to p2p lending, even if the borrowers are vetted by the p2p lending platform. Youre essentially taking the same risks that a bank would take when writing a couple of personal loans, and thats quite far removed from a safe haven for your cash. If you have enough money to invest not save, invest then it might be worth putting a small amount into p2p lending, but its anything but an alternative to a savings account."

I dont have any data on the relative numbers of who is being notifiednotifying between merchants and payment processors, but at the point when your card is identified as compromised theres no reason to suppose that an individual merchant in the traditional sense has been compromised, let alone identified. In fact because theres a fast moving investigation it could even be a false alarm that led to your card getting cancelled. Conversely it could be a hugely complex multinational investigation which would be jeopardised. Its simply not safe to assume that simply \"brand X\" has been compromised, therefore everything \"brand X\" knows about you is also compromised Furthermore theres no reason to assume the merchant has even admitted to, or discovered the root cause.

    "body": "Your understanding of the stock market is absolutely correct theoretically. However there is a lot more to it. A stock on a given day is effected by a lot of factors. These factors could really be anything. For example, if you are buying a stock in an agricultural company and there was no rainfall this year, there is a big chance that your stock will lose value. There is also a chance that a war breaks out tomorrow and due to all the government spending on the war, the economy collapses and effects the prices of stocks. Why does this happen? This happens because bad rainfall or war can get people to lose confidence in a stock market. On the other hand GDP growth and low unemployment rates can make people think positive and increase the demand in a stock driving the prices up. The main factor in the stock market is sentimentHow people perceive certain news. This causes a stock to rise or fall even before the event actually happens. For example Weather pundits predicted good rainfall for next year. That news is already known to people, so if the weather pundit was correct, it might not drive the prices up. However, if the rainfall was way better than people expected it to be it would drive the price up and vice versa. These are just examples at a basic level. There are a lot of other factors which determine the price of the stock. The best way to look at itIn my personal opinion is the way Warren Buffet puts it, i.e. look at the stock as a business and see the potential growth over a long period of time. There will be unexpected events, but in the long run, the business must be profitable. There are various ways to value a company such as Price to earnings ratios, PEG ratios, discounted cash flows and you can also create your own. See what works best for you and record your successfailure ratio before you actually put money in. Good Luck,"

    "body": "1 Usually, the choice between Traditional vs. Roth is whether you believe that your tax rate will be higher or lower in the future than it is now. Your income is probably in the 25 bracket now. Its hard to say whether that should be considered \"high\" or \"low\". Some people advocate Roth only for 15 bracket but your income would probably go into higher brackets in the future, so Roth may be preferable from this point of view. Roth IRA also has another advantage that the principal of contributions can be taken out at any time without tax or penalty, so it can serve as an emergency fund just as well as money in taxable accounts. Given that you may not have a lot of money saved up right now, this is useful. 2 In a sense, its nice to have a mix of Traditional and Roth when you withdraw to hedge against uncertainty in future tax rates and have the option of choosing whichever one is advantageous to withdraw when you need to withdraw. That said, you will likely have many years of access to a 401k and high income in your future working years, in which you can contribute to a Traditional 401k or if no access to 401k, then Traditional IRA, so a mix will almost certainly happen even if you go all Roth IRA now. 3 I think that depends on you, whether you are a handson or handsoff kind of investor."

One thing that I feel is very sketchy is when they were verifying my identity they said \"Does your Social Security Number end in . Is your Birthday MonthDayYear.\" That is not sketchy. It would be sketchy for a caller to ask you to give that information thats a common scheme for identity theft. OSCEOLA are following the rules on this one. My mom suggested I should consider applying for bankruptcy Wont help. Student loans cant be discharged in bankruptcy. You have the bankruptcy \"reform\" act passed during the Bush 43 regime for that. The loan itself is from school. What school? Contact them and ask for help. They may have washed their hands of your case when they turned over your file to OSCEOLA. Then again, they may not. Its worth finding out. Also, name and shame the school. Future applicants should be warned that they will do this. What can I do to aid in my negotiations with this company? Dont negotiate on the phone. Youve discovered that they wont honor such negotiations. Ask for written communications sent by postal mail. Keep copies of everything, including both sides of the canceled checks you use to make payments during the six months and in the future. Keep making the payments you agreed to in the conversation six months ago. Do not, EVER, ignore a letter from them. Do not, EVER, skip going to court if they send you a summons to appear. They count on people doing this. They can get a default judgement if you dont show up. Then youre well and truly screwed. What do you want? You want the 4K fee removed. If you want something else, figure out what it is. Heres what to do Write them a polite letter explaining what you said here. Recount the conversation you had with their telephone agent where they said they would remove the 4K fee if you made payments. Recount the later conversation. If possible give the dates of both conversations and the names of the both agents. Explain the situation completely. Dont assume the recipient of your letter knows anything about your case. Include evidence that you made payments as agreed during the six months. If you were late or something, dont withhold that. Ask them to remove the extra 4K from your account, and ask for whatever else you want. Send the letter to them with a return receipt requested, or even registered mail. That will prevent them from claiming they didnt get it. And it will show them youre serious. Write a cover letter admitting your default, saying you relied on their negotiation to set things straight, and saying youre dismayed they arent sticking to their word. The cover letter should ask for help sorting this out. Send copies of the letter with the cover letter to Be sure to mark your letter to OSCEOLA \"cc\" all these folks, so they know you are asking for help. It cant hurt to call your congressional representatives office and ask to whom you should send the letter, and then address it by name. This is called Constituent Service, and they take pride in it. If you send this letter with copies youre letting them know you intend to fight. The collection agency may decide its not worth the fight to get the 4K and decide to let it go. Again, if they call to pressure you, say youd rather communicate in writing, and that they are not to call you by telephone. Then hang up. Should I hire a lawyer? Yes, but only if you get a court summons or if you dont get anywhere with this. You can give the lawyer all this paperwork Ive suggested here, and it will help her come up to speed on your case. This is the kind of stuff the lawyer would do for you at well over 100 per hour. Is bankruptcy really an option Certainly not, unfortunately. Never forget that student lenders and their collection agencies are dangerous and clever predators. You are their lawful prey. They look at you, lick their chops, and think, \"food.\" Watch John Olivers takedown of that industry. httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vhxUAntt1z2c Good luck and stay safe."

    "body": "Practically, as an ebay buyer I have never seen any way to keep a balance in paypal and top it off from my bank account under my own control. It is all automated, and as I seem to recall linking with a bank account or credit card was necessary to get some kind of \"confirmed address\" status out of Paypal so that eBay sellers would be more willing to trust me as a buyer and know that my shipping address was legitimate. As a seller, I can keep a balance at paypal from eBay sales and ask for it back in my checking account instead of keeping it in paypal to purchase items later. In terms of advice, in my opinion the paypal transfer limits or how to set them is not the answer needed to protect ones finances in this situation. In an error or cyberattack scenario, you have to consider the possibility that any limits are exceeded. When your online activity of any kind is linked to a bank account, any amount in that linked bank account is probably at risk. It doesnt really matter if it is paypal, or a server rental account, or amazon. If it can be abused, and it is linked to your bank account, then someone might abuse it and leave you with a bill. That you might be ultimately victorious is of little consequence if someone steals money you really needed right now and the devotion of time and energy to \"work the bureaucracy\" to get your money back will distract from performance at work or school. So the next step up in protection is to firewall the bank account you use for online purchases from your other bank accounts where your salary is received. The best way to do it is with different banks instead of merely different accounts, but that is also the most inconvenient for filling the account back up. Nowadays  at least in the USA  at several banks you can open a \"free\" checking account for a minimum deposit like 500 or 1000 that must stay in the account to be fee free at the end of each month. Whatever balance you keep in the account you use for your \"risky\" online transactions will be the maximum that can disappear in an incident, downside being you have to feed the account from time to time to keep it above the minimum as you make purchases."

Be careful close or roll any positions before delivery, of course, unless you have a need for a bunch of actual barrels of oil. Finally, you can consider investing in commodities ETFs or Energy stocks or stock ETFs that are strongly related to the price of oil. As Keshlam mentions, care is advised in all these methods.

Of course, several US mutual fund companies have also been lowering the expense ratio of their mutual funds in recent years because more and more investors have been paying attention to this particular performance parameter, and opting for funds that have low expense ratios. But many US funds have not reduced their expense ratios very much and continue to have expense ratios of 1 or even higher. For example, American Funds Developing World Growth and Income Fund DWGAX charges a 1.39 expense ratio while their 2060 Retirement Fund AANTX charges 1.12 the funds also have a 5.75 sales charge Putnam Capital Opportunities Fund charges 1.91 for their Class C shares, and so on. Many funds with high expense ratios and sometimes sales charges as well show up as options in far too many 401k plans, especially 401k plans of small companies, because small companies do not enjoy economies of scale and do not have much negotiating power when dealing with 401k custodians and administrators."

I often will give clients a small discount of 1.5 for paying my invoices within 10 days, which does motivate some to pay sooner, depending on the client and the amount of the invoice. If youve already added a small amount to your fees in the first place then providing the discount is good public relations that doesnt actually cost you anything.

As you say, UK and EU law require that prices are displayed including relevant taxes. Since this business is in the US, they might be able to claim that those rules dont apply to them. But Im not aware of even US businesses being able to claim sales tax from a US customer months after originally making a sale, and it goes against all reasonable principles of law if they would be able to do it. So the business should really just accept that they screwed up and theyll now have to take the hit and pay the tax themselves. They can work as if the pretax price was 12.991.2  10.825, leaving 2.165 they need to hand over to HMRC. I dont think theres any legal way they can demand money from you now, and certainly for such a low sum of money theres no practical way they could. I cant find anything definitive one way or the other, but I suppose its possible that HMRC would consider you the importer under these circumstances and so liable for the VAT yourself. But I dont know of any practial way to actually report this to HMRC or pay them the money, and again given the amount theres no realistic chance theyd want to chase you for it. In your shoes I would either ignore the email, or write back and politely tell them that they should have advertised the cost at the time and youre not willing to pay extra now.

EDIT as pointed out in a comment, the company behind this or at least one with a very similar problem and wording in their emails! did end up acknowledging that they cant actually do this and that theyll need to pay the tax out of the money they already collected, as I described above.

Or, if your loan permits it not all do talk to the bank which holds the loan and,or read the paperwork you didnt look at, you may be able to make additional payments to reduce the principal of the loan, which will reduce the amount and duration of the loan and could significantly reduce the total interest paid ... at the cost of requiring you pay more each month, or pay an additional sum up front. Returning the car is not an option. A new car loses a large portion of its value the moment you drive it off the dealers lot and it ceases to be a \"new\" car. You cant return it. You can sell it as a recent model used car, but you will lose money on the deal so even if you use that to pay down the loan you will still owe the bank money. Given the pain involved that way, you might as well keep the car and just try to refinance or pay it off. Next time, read and understand all the paperwork before signing. If you had decided this was a mistake within 3 days of buying, you might have been able to take advantage of \"cooling down period\" laws to cancel the contract, if such laws exist in your area.

One subtlety you may be missing is that there is always a price associated with an offer to buy shares. That is, you dont put in an order simply to buy 1 share of ABC, you put in an order to buy 1 share of ABC for 10. If no one is willing to sell a share of ABC for 10, then your order will go unfilled. This happens millions of times a day as traders try to figure the cheapest price they can get for a stock. Practically speaking, there is always a price at which people are willing to sell their shares. You can put in a market order for 1 share of ABC, which says essentially \"I want one share of ABC, and I will pay whatever the market deems to be the price\". Your broker will find you 1 share, but you may be very unhappy about the price you have to pay! While its very rare for a market to have nobody willing to sell at any price, it occasionally happens that no one is willing to buy at any price. This causes a market crash, as in the 20072008 financial crisis, when suddenly everyone became very suspicious of how much debt the major banks actually held, and for a few days, very few traders were willing to buy bank stocks at any price."

Those numbers come from the 10Q filing and investor summary from Microsoft, but are provided to NASDAQ by Zacks Investment Research, as noted on the main page you linked to. Thats a big investment data firm. Im not sure why they reported nonGAAP Microsoft numbers and not, say, AAPL numbers its possible they felt the nonGAAP numbers reflect things better or have in the past for some material reason, or its possible they made a typo, though the last three quarters at least all used nonGAAP numbers for MSFT. MSFT indicates that the difference in GAAP and nonGAAP revenue is primarily deferred revenue from Windows and Halo. I did confirm that the SEC filing for MSFT does include the GAAP number, not the nonGAAP number as youd expect. I will also note that it looks like the 10Q is not the only source of information. Look at ORCL for example they had in the March 2016 report period ending 22916 revenues of .50share GAAP  .64share nonGAAP. But the NASDAQ page indicates .59share for that quarter. My suspicion is that the investment data firm Zacks does additional work and includes certain numbers they feel belong in the revenue stream but are not in the GAAP numbers. Perhaps MS and Oracle have more of those  such as deferred software revenues AAPL has relatively little of that, as most of their profit is hardware."

You really shouldnt be looking for aggressive growth which means taking on some risk. That comes from money outside of the emergency fund. The simplest thing to do would be to shop around for a different savings account. There are some deals out there that are better than ING. Here is a good list. The \"traditional\" places to keep an emergency fund are Money Market Mutual Funds not to be confused with Money Market Accounts. They are considered extremely safe investments. However, the returns on such a fund is pretty low these days, often lower than a highyield online savings account. The next step up would be a bond fund more volatility, slightly better return. Pick something that relies on Government bonds, not \"highyield\" junk bonds or anything crazy like that. Fidelity Four in One comes pretty close to your \"index of indexes\" request, but it isnt the most stable thing. Youd probably do better with a safer investment."

A group of friends helping each other have a much higher prospect of success. It has been proven that approximately 70 of jobs have been obtained through networking.

I would simply make his salary dependent upon the revenue he generates. For example, lets say you can make a widget for 4 and you expect to sell them for 10. Your profit would be 6, and with the suggested split he would receive 2, you 4. Instead I would have him receive like 15 of the revenue generated This allows for some discounts for bulk items and covers the cost of processing sales.

According to httpwww.kpmg.comCaenIssuesAndInsightsArticlesPublicationsTaxRatesFederalandProvincialTerritorialTaxRatesforIncomeEarnedCCPC2015Dec31.pdf the corporate tax rates for 2015 are According to page 3 The federal and provincial tax rates shown in the tables apply to investment income earned by a CCPC, other than capital gains and dividends received from Canadian corporations. The rates that apply to capital gains are onehalf of the rates shown in the tables. Dividends received from Canadian corporations are deductible in computing regular Part I tax, but may be subject to Part IV tax, calculated at a rate of 33 13. If I understand that correctly, this means that a Corporation in Quebec pays 46.6 on investment income other than capital gains and dividends, 23.3 on capital gains and 33.33 on dividends. Im marking this answer as community wiki so anyone can correct these numbers if they are incorrect. UPDATE According to httpwww.pwc.comcaentaxpublicationspwcfactsfigures201407en.pdf page 22 the tax rate on taxable dividends received from certain Canadian corporations is 33 13. Further, this is refunded to the corporation through the \"refundable dividend tax on hand\" RDTOH mechanism at a rate of 1 for every 3 of taxable dividends paid. My interpretation is as follows if the corporation receives 100 of dividends from another company, it pays 33.33 tax. If that corporation then pays out 100 of dividends at a later time, it receives a tax refund of 33.33. Meaning, the original tax gets refunded. Note the first line is for the 2015 tax year while the second link is for the 2014 tax year. The numbers might be a little different but the taxrefund process remains the same."

    "header": "Can a put option and call option be exercised for the same stock with different strike prices?",
    "body": "You could have both options exercised and assigned to you on the same day, but I dont think you could lose money on both on the same day. The reason is that while exercises are immediate, assignments are processed after the markets close at the end of each day. See httpwww.888options.comhelpfaqassignment.jsp for details. So you would get both assignments at the same time, that night. The net effect should be that you dont own any stock someone would put you the stock, then itd be called away and you dont have the options anymore. You should have incoming cash of 1500 selling the stock to the call exerciser and outgoing cash of 1300 buying from the put exerciser, right? So you would have no more options but 200 more cash in your account in the morning. You bought at 13 and sold at 15. This options position is an agreement to buy at 13 and sell at 15 at someone elses option. The way you lose money is if one of the options isnt exercised while the other is, i.e. if the stock is below 13 so nobody is going to opt to buy from you at 15, but theyll sell to you at 13 or above 15 so nobody is going to opt to sell to you at 13, but theyll buy from you at 15. You make money if neither is exercised you keep the premium you sold for or both are exercised you keep the gap between the two, plus the premium. Having both exercised is surely rare, since early exercise is rare to begin with, and tends to happen when options are deep in the money so youd expect both to be exercised if both are deep in the money at some point. Having both be exercised on the same day ... cant be common, but its maybe most likely just before expiration with minimal time value, if the stock moves around quickly so both options are in the money at some point during the day."

    "body": "Some of this may depend on how your employer chose to deal with your notice period. Most employers employ you for the duration which means youd be covered for March on your insurance. They could send you home but pay you in which case youre an employee for the duration still or they could terminate you on your notice day, and give you effectively a severance equal to two weeks pay. That is what it sounds like they did. They should have made this clear to you when you left on 223. Assuming you work in an atwill state, theres nothing wrong legally with them doing it this way, although it is not something I believe is right morally. Basically, theyre trying to avoid some costs for your last two weeks if they employ you through 36, they pay for another month of insurance, and some other things. In exchange, you lose some insurance benefits and FSA benefits. Your FSA terminates the day you terminate employment see this pdf for a good explanation of these issues. This means that the FSA administrator is correct to reject expenses incurred after 223. The FSA is in no way tied to your insurance plan you can have one or the other or both. You still can submit claims for expenses prior to 223 during your runout period, which is often 60 or 90 days. In the future, you will want to think ahead when leaving employment, and you may want to time when you give notice carefully to maximize your benefits in the event something like this happens again. Its a shady business practice in my mind to terminate you when you give notice, but its not unknown. As far as the HSAFSA, you arent eligible to contribute to an HSA in a year youre also in an FSA, except that they use \"plan year\" in the language so if your benefits period is 61yy  531yy, thats the relevant year. Id be cautious about opening a HSA without advice from a tax professional, or at least a more knowledgeable person here."

This will make sure you have a deeper understanding of where your money is going, and what is it being saved for.

As part of the budgetingcashflow exercise, make sure you have any outstanding debts covered. Are your credit card balances under control? Do you have other outstanding loans education, auto, mortgage, other? Normally, youd address these in order from highest to lowest interest rate. Your budget should address any immediate mandatory expenses rent, utilities, food and long term existing debts. Then comes discretionary spending and savings especially until you have a decent emergency fund. How much can you afford to spend on discretionary purchases? How much do you want to be able to spend? If the want is greater than the can, what steps can you take to rememdy that? With savings you can have a whole new set of planning to consider. How much do you leave in the bank? Do you keep some amount in a CD ladder? How much goes into retirement savings accounts 401k, Roth vs. Traditional IRA, college savings accounts, or a plain brokerage account? How do you balance your overall portfolio there is a wealth of information on portfolio management? What level of risk are you comfortable with? What level of risk should you consider, given your age and goals? How involved do you want to be with your portfolio, or do you want someone else to manage it?

Currently my bank offers this service but Im willing to use other sources I cant make UKspecific recommendations, but Id compare your banks fees to those of a discount broker  as well as the variety and level of service available. I would like to regularly increase the amount invested in shares. Is it worth doing this in say 200 increments? Take a look at the fees associated with each investment. Divide the fee by the increment to see what percent youll lose to feescommissions. Keep in mind that you have to gain more than that percentage to start earning a positive return on your investment. If you have access to feefree automatic mutual fund investments, and you can commit to the 200 amount on a regular basis going forward, then this can be a completely free way of making these incremental investments. See also this answer on dollar cost averaging, and my comment on the other answer on that question for how fees impact returns. When buying shares should I focus on say two or three companies, or diversify more? I would diversify into two or three different index funds. Read up on asset allocation. For example, you might invest 13 of your balance into SP 500 index fund, bond index fund, and MSCI EAFE index fund but thats just a rough example, and not necessarily good for you.

You can either have a reliable car that has cheap running costs but will be expensive to buy or a cheap car that is unreliable. If you are mechanically minded then reliability might not be that important to you. However, if you must get to work on time every day then owning a car that breaks down once every six months might be something you wish to avoid. There are a lot of hidden costs that should be thought about very carefully when considering purchasing a car In my country, annual car registration costs are around 650. I budget around 1000 for maintenance each year a major  minor service and some extra repair work. When I factor in an amount for depreciation, that brings the running costs of the car to somewhere between 1500 and 2000 per annum before Ive driven it anywhere. Generally I will fill up my car for 50 around once a month I dont drive too often which makes my total cost of ownership somewhere around 2500 per annum. When I was driving my car to work daily, the petrol costs were much higher at around 50 per week, which made my TCO somewhere around 4500 p.a. And this is on an extremely reliable, fuel efficient 2006 model car which cost me 18k to purchase. I have no debt on this car. But the car itself is a liability. Any car will be a liability. I understand that petrol prices are ridiculously low in the US and probably registration is lower as well. In this case you will need to adjust your figures and do the maths to work out what your annual cost of ownership will be. There are three alternatives to car ownership to consider which may save you money Public transportation and car pooling are highly recommended from a financial perspective, though you may not have access to either in your situation. Moving closer to work may also be an option, though for many jobs this may increase your cost of living. If you decide that you do need a car and decide that 2000 is not going to get you the car you feel you need 2000 usually does not get you much, you will need to decide how to finance the car. You will want to avoid most dealerbased finance deals. Be very wary of any dealer offering interest free finance as they usually have some pretty nasty conditions. Getting a loan from your parents or another family member is usually the best option. Otherwise consider getting a personal loan, which will have a lower interest rate than a credit card or dealer finance. Another option could be to get a credit card on an interestfree promotional deal which you could pay down before the interest kicks in. Be warned though, these deals usually require you to pay off your whole balance before the due date or they will backcharge interest on the whole amount. In short, these are the decisions that you will need to make"

I believe your question is. \"Does not having a credit card lower your credit score\" If that is the question then in the UK at least the answer appears to be yes. Having a credit card makes you less of a risk because you have proven that you can handle a little bit of debt and pay it back. I have a really tiny credit history. Never had a credit card and the only people who will lend to me are my own bank because they can actually see my income  expenditure. When I have queried my bank and at stores offering credit they have said that no credit history isnt far off a bad credit record.

What this really boils down to is the number of shares a company has outstanding. Given the same earnings  PE, a company with fewer shares will have a higher EPS than a company with more shares. Knowing that, I dont think the number of shares has much if anything to do with the quality of a company. Its similar to the arguments I hear often from people new to investing where they think that a company with a share price of 100share must be better than a company with a share price of 30share simply because the share price is higher."

    "body": "You dont have to use an agent broker, as you call it, but it is strongly advised. In some counties lawyers are required, in some not. Check your local requirements. Similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and disbursing of money. You will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service Im guessing here, but it makes sense to me. You will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company, and it might be hard without an agent. Agents required by law to know all the details of the process, and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into. They have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports, they know what to demand from the seller disclosures, information, etc, they know how and from where to get the HOA docs and disclosures, and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information comparable sales, comparable listings, list vs sales statistics, etc. It is hard to do all that alone, but if you do  you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5 the agents fees are up to 5 mostly. I bought several properties in California and in other states, and I wouldnt do it without an agent on my side. But if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title, mortgage, insurance or resale, then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent, and there are people doing that."

Quite risky as if you do need to dip into it, how fast could you get the cash? Also, do you realize the tax implications when you do sell the shares should you have an emergency? In the worstcase scenario, lets say you have a financial emergency at the same time the stock market crashes and loses half its value. You could still liquidate the rest and have sufficient funds for 6 months. Am I underestimating the risks of this strategy? Thats not worst case scenario though. Worst case scenario would be another 911 where the markets are closed for nearly a week and you need the money but cant get the funds converted to cash in the bank that you can use. This is in addition to the potential wait for a settlement in the case of using ETFs if you choose to go that way. In the case of money market funds, CDs and other near cash equivalents these can be accessed relatively easily which is part of the point. A staggered approach where some cash is kept in house, some in accounts that can easily accessed and some in other investments may make sense though the breakdown would differ depending on how much risk people are willing to take. If it truly is an emergency fund then the odds of needing it should be very slim, so why live with near zero return on that money? Something to consider is what is called an emergency here? For some people a sudden 1,000 bill to fix their car that just broke down is an emergency. For others, there could be emergency trips to visit family that may have gotten into accidents or gotten a diagnosis that they may pass away soon. Consider what do you want to call an emergency here as chances are you may not be considering all that people would think is an emergency. There is the question of what other sources of money do you have to cover should issues arise."

    "body": "TLDR You should read something like The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, and read some of the popular questions on this site. The main message that you will get from that research is that there is an inescapable connection between risk and reward, or to put it another way, volatility and reward. Things like government bonds and money market accounts have quite low risk, but also low reward. They offer a nearly guaranteed 13. Stocks, highrisk bonds, or business ventures like your soda and vending machine scheme may return 20 a year some years, but you could also lose money, maybe all youve invested e.g., what if a vandal breaks one of your machines or the government adds a 5 tax for each can of soda?. Research has shown that the best way for the normal person to use their money to make money is to buy index funds these are funds that buy a bunch of different stocks, and to hold them for a long time over 1015 years. By buying a broad range of stocks, you avoid some of the risks of investing e.g., if one companys stock tanks, you dont lose very much, while keeping most of the benefits. By keeping them for a long time, the good years more than even out the bad years, and you are almost guaranteed to make 67year. Buying individual stocks is a really, really bad idea. If you arent willing to invest the time to become an expert investor, then you will almost certainly do worse than index funds over the long run. Another option is to use your capital to start a side business like your vending machine idea. As mentioned before, this still has risks. One of those risks is that it will take more work than you expect who will find places for your vending machines? Who will fill them? Who will hire those who fill them? etc.. The great thing about an index fund is that it doesnt take work or research. However, if there are things that you want to do, that take capital, this can be a good way to make more income."

    "body": "One way to think of the typical fixed rate mortgage, is that you can calculate the balance at the end of the month. Add a months interest rate times balance, then divide by 12 then subtract your payment. The principal is now a bit less, and theres a snowball effect that continues to drop the principal more each month. Even though some might object to my use of the word \"compounding,\" a prepayment has that effect. e.g. you have a 5 mortgage, and pay 100 extra principal. If you did nothing else, 5 compounded over 28 years is about 4X. So, if you did this early on, it would reduce the last payment by about 400. Obviously, there are calculators and spreadsheets that can give the exact numbers. I dont know the rules for car loans, but one would actually expect them to work similarly, and no, you are not crazy to expect that. Just the opposite."

If you try to place a limit order at the bid or ask, by the time you enter your order the price might have moved and you might need to keep amending your limit order in order to buy or sell, and as such you start chasing the market. A market order will guarantee your order gets executed. Also, an important point to consider, is that market orders are often used in combination with other orders such as conditional orders. For example if you have a stop loss conditional order set at say 10 below your buy price, you might want to use a market order to make sure your order gets executed if the price drops 10 and your stop loss gets triggered, making sure that you get out of the stock instead of being stuck with a limit order 10 below your buy price whilst the stock keeps falling further."

One example of this is Alligent Air. They give you a 6 discount if you pay with a debit card which was about 5 of the ticket price. Anytime you borrow money, even as well intentioned and thought out as you plan to do so, you are increasing risk. By managing it carefully you can certainly mitigate it.

I did the costco amex deal for about 12 years earning about 300400 per year and only once getting hit with a latefinance charge. Despite the success, I opted to end this for a few different reasons. First off people using credit tend to spend more. Secondly, I felt it was not worth my time in management. Thirdly, I did not want the risk. Despite the boasts of many, the reality is that few people actually pay off their card each month. By your post, it seems to me that you will be one of the rare few.

    "body": "It all has to do with risk and reward. The risk is that interest rates will rise. To entice you to go with the variable, they make it so it is cheaper if interest rates never rise. Your job is to guess whether interest rates are likely to go up or not. In a first approximation, you should go fixed. The bank employs very smart people whose entire job is to know whether interest rates will go up or not. Those people chose the price difference between the two, and its sure to favour the bank. That is, the risk of extra payments youll make on the variable is probably more than the enticement. But, some people cant sleep at night if their payments or more realistically, the interest part of their payments might double. If thats you, go fixed. If thats not you, understand that the enticement actually has to be turned up a bit, to get more people to go variable, because of the sleepingatnight feature. Think long and hard about your budget and what would happen if your payment jumped. If you could handle it, variable might be the better choice. Personally, I have been taking \"variable\" on my mortgage for decades and now I dont have one and never once regretted it. I also counselled my oldest child to take variable on her mortgage. Over this century so far, if rates ticked up, they didnt tick up to the level the fixed was offered at. Mostly they have sat flat.

If the company is successful, the price of the shares goes up. If its unsuccessful, the price goes down. You have no control over that. If the company fails completely and goes bankrupt, then the shares are worthless. Dilution is where the company decides to sell more shares. If they are being sold at market value, then you havent really lost anything. But if they are sold below cost perhaps as an incentive to certain staff, then the value of the company per share is now less. So your shares may be worth a bit less than they were. You would get to vote at the AGM on such schemes. But unless you own a significant proportion of the shares in the company, your vote will probably make no difference.

The information others want to see from the SCHUFA are a bit different. If you want to example rent a house or an apartment, the landlord often wants to see a SCHUFA statement which only shows that there are no negative entries. This statement you can get easily from online and they dont mention your credit score there. If you apply for a real credit or want to lease a car, they want to look deeper in your SCHUFA profile. However, very important is They need signed permission to do this. Every participating company can submit entries to your profile where the score is calculated from. For example mobile phone plans, leasing a car, applying for a loan. Some lenders decide on the score itself, some on the overall profile and some also take your income into account. Since there is no hire  fire in Germany you are often asked to show your last 3 paychecks. This, in combination with your SCHUFA score is used for determination if you are eligible for a loan or not. However, they check through every entry which is made there and as long as it is reasonable and fits to your income car for 800 EURmonth with a 1000 EUR salary does not! you should not have a problem establishing a good score. The, in my eyes, unfair part about Schufa is that they take your zip code and your neighborhood into account when calculating their score. Also moving often affects the score negatively. To finally answer your question Credit history is also built by mobile phone plans etc. in Germany. As long as you pay everything on time you should be fine. A bad score can definitely hurt you, but it is not as important to have a score as it is in the US because the banks also determine your creditworthiness based on your monthly income and your spending behavior."

Mostly likely if they had to make a 1 million USD payment a year from now and they had the cash on hand they would be able to just make the payment today. A more common scenario for currency forwards is for investment hedging. Say that European company wants to buy into a mutual fund of some sort, say FUSEX. That is a USD based mutual fund. You cant buy into it directly with Euros. So if the company wants to buy into the fund they would need to convert their Euros to to USD. But now they have an extra risk parameter. They are not just exposed to the fluctuations of the fund, they are also exposed to the fluctuations of the currency market. Perhaps that fund will make a killing, but the exchange rate will tank and they will lose all their gains. By creating a forward to hedge their currency exposure risk they do not face this risk flip side if the exchange rate rises in a favorable rate they also dont get that benefit, unless they use an FX Option, but that is generally more expensive and complicated."

They can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity, but they would be sold at a deep discount, so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other \"fees\".

    "body": "Putting a dollar amount on the valuation of a start up business is an art form that often has very little at all to do with any real numbers and more to do with your \"salesman\" abilities when talking with the VC. That said, there are a few starting points First is past sales, the cost of those sales and a hopefully realistic growth curve. However, you dont have that so this gets harder. Do you have any actual assets? Machinery, computers, desks, patents, etc. Things that you actually own. If so, then add those in. If this is a software startup, \"code\" is an asset, but without sales its incredibly hard to put a value on it. The best Ive come up with is \"How much would it cost for someone else to build it .. after theyve seen yours\". Yes, you may have spent 5,000 hours building something but could someone else duplicate it, or at least the major parts, in 200 hours after seeing a demo? Use the lower number. If I was you, Id look hard at my business plan. Hopefully you were as honest as you can be when writing it and that it is as researched as possible. What is it going to take to get that first sale? What do you actually need to get there? hint your logo on the side of a building is NOT a necessary expense. Nor is really nice office space. Once you have that first sale, what is the second going to take? Can you extrapolate out to 3 years? How many key members are there? How much is their contribution worth? At what point will you be profitable? Next is to look at risks. You havent done this before, thats huge  Im assuming simply because you asked this question. Another is competitors  hopefully they already exist because opening a new market is incredibly hard and expensive on the flip side, hopefully there arent that many because entering a crowded market is equally hard and expensive. Note each are possible, but take radically different approaches and sums of money  and 200k isnt going to cut it no matter what it is you are selling. That said, competition should be able to at least point you in the direction of a price point and estimate for how long sales take. If any are publicly traded then you have additional info to help you set a valuation. Are there any potential regulatory or legal issues? What happens if a key member leaves, dies or is otherwise no longer available? Insurance only helps so much if the one guy that knows everything literally gets run over. God help you if this person likes to go skydiving. I bring risks up because you will have to surmount them during this negotiation. For example, asking for 200k with zero hard assets, while trying to sell software to government agencies assuming a 3 week sales cycle will have you laughed at for naivety. Whereas asking for 10m in the same situation, with a team that has governmental sales experience would likely work. Another big question is exit strategy do you intend to IPO or sell to a competitor or a business in a related category? If selling, do you have evidence that the target company actually buys others, and if so, how did those deals work out? What did they look for in order to buy? Exit strategy is HUGE to a VC and they will want to make several multiples of their money back in a relatively short amount of time. Can you realistically support that for how much you are asking for? If not then going through an Angel group would be better. They have similar questions, but very different expectations. The main thing is that no one knows what your business is worth because it is 100 unproven after 2 years and is therefore a huge financial risk. If the money you are asking for is to complete product development then that risk factor just went up radically as you arent even talking about sales. If the money is purely for the sales channel, then its likely not enough. However if you know what its going to take to get that first sale and have at least an educated idea on how much its going to cost to repeat that then you should have an idea for how much money you want. From there you need to decide how much of the business it is worth to you to give up in order to get that money and, voila, you have a \"pre money valuation\". The real trick will be to convince the VC that you are right which takes research and a rock solid presentation and negotiating from there. No matter what offer a small percentage of the business for the money you want and realize youll likely give up much more than that. A few things you should know usually by year 3 its apparent if a startup is going to work out or not. Youre in year 2 with no sales. That doesnt look good unless you are building a physical product, have a competent team with hard experience doing this, have patents at least filed, a proven test product, and hopefully have a few preorders and just need cash to deliver. Although in that situation, Id probably tell you to ask your friends and family before talking to a VC. Even kickstarter.com would be better. 200k just isnt a lot of money and should be very easy to raise from Friends or Angels. If you cant then that speaks volumes to an institutional VC. A plus is having two or three people financially invested in the company more than that is sometimes a problem while having only 1 is a red flag. If its a web thing and youve been doing this for 2 years with zero sales and still need another 200k to complete it then Id say you need to take a hard look at what youve built and take it to market right now. If you cant do that, then Id say it might be time to abandon this idea and move on as youll likely have to give up 80 to get that 200k and most VCs Ive run into wouldnt bother at that level. Which begs the question how did the conversation with the VC start? Did you approach them or did they approach you? If the latter, how did they even find out about you? Do they actually know anything about you or is this a fishing expedition? If the latter, then this is probably a complete waste of your time. The above is only a rough guide because at the end of the day something is only worth what someone else is willing to pay. 200k in cash is a tiny sum for most VCs, so without more information I have no clue why one would be interested in you. I put a number of hard questions and statements in here. I dont actually want you to answer me, those are for you to think about. Also, none of this shouldnt be taken as a discouragement, rather it should shock you into a realistic viewpoint and, hopefully, help you understand how others are going to see your baby. If the VC has done a bit of research and is actually interested in investing then they will bring up all the same things and likely more in order to convince you to give up a very large part of it.

    "body": "Myself I am in a similar position. Ive had a few good conversations about this with people in the financial services industry. It all depends how much time you want to spend on yielding your profits and how much risk you would like to take. High time and high risk obviously means higher expected gain, but also has a high chance of creating a loss. Option 1 You could buy a home now and take out a mortgage with a high down payment thus lower interest rates and rent it out. By the time you are ready to have your own house, you can decide to either take out a mortgage on your second house and make money off your first house, and keep renting it out. Or you could move in there yourself. If you use an assetback mortgage im not sure if that is the term, but a mortgage where in the worst case you give your home back to the bank, you generally carry least risk. If you keep doing this you can have 2 houses paid off if everything goes well. Option 2 You could also invest in stocks. This all depends on the risk you want to take and the time you want to put in it. Option 3 You could also put the money in a savings account. Some banks will give you better interest rates if you lock the money for a set amount of years. Option 4 You could buy a foreclosure and try to flip it, though this is very risky and requires a lot of time. Also, it is important to also have some sort of emergency fund, so whatever you do, dont spend all your money. Save some for a rainy day  Hope it helps.."

Running a business through a personal account joint or otherwise is a sure way to get that account shut down. Your bank will want to know the structure of the business, and will require documentation to support that. For a partnership, they will probably want a copy of the partnership agreement. For an LLC, theyll probably want a copy of the filing with Ohio Secretary of State as well as the operating agreement etc. That said, pop into a local bank and ask a business banker directly what you should do. They deal with new businesses all the time, and would probably be best qualified to help you figure out the bank account aspect of it. Regarding business structure... this really impacts a lot more than just the type of bank account to open and how you file your taxes. It is something you guys should really discuss with an attorney. What happens if down the road one of you quits? What happens if you want to bring in a new partner later? What if there is a disagreement about something?

    "body": "The same day rule in the UK is a rule for matching purposes only. It says that sales on any day are matched firstly with purchases made on the same day for the purposes of ascertaining any gainloss. Hence the phrase bedandbreakfast bb when you wish to crystalise a gain that is within the exempt amount and reestablish a purchase price at a higher level. You do the sale on one day, just before the market closes, which gets matched with your original purchase, and then you buy the shares back the next day, just after the market opens. This is standard taxplanning. Whenever you have a paper gain, and you wish to lock that gain out of being taxed, you do a bedandbreakfast transaction, the idea being to use up your annual exemption each and every year. Of course, if your dealing costs are high, then they may outweigh any tax saved, and so it would be pointless. For the purpose of an example, lets assume that the UK tax year is the same as the calendar year. Scenario 1. Suppose I bought some shares in 2016, for a total price of Stg.50,000. Suppose by the end of 2016, the holding is worth Stg.54,000, resulting in a paper gain of Stg.4,000. Question. Should I do a bb transaction to make use of my Stg.11,100 annual exemption ? Answer. Well, with transaction costs at 1.5 for a roundtrip trade, suppose, and stamp duty on the purchase of 0.5, your total costs for a bb will be Stg1,080, and your tax saved upon some future sale date assuming you are a 20 taxpayer is 20x4,0001,080  Stg584 the transaction costs are deductible, we assume. This does not make sense. Scenario 2. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg60,000 by end2016. Answer. The total transaction costs are 2x60,000  1,200 and so the taxable gain of 10,0001,200  8,800 would result in a tax bill of 20x8,800  1,760 and so the transaction costs are lower than the tax to be saved a strict analysis would take into account only the present value of the tax to be saved, it makes sense to crystalise the gain. We sell some day before the tax yearend, and reinvest the very next day. Scenario 3. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg70,000 by end2016. Answer. The gain of 20,000 less costs would result in a tax bill for 1,500 this is 20x20,000  2x70,000  11,100 . This tax bill will be on top of the dealing costs of 1,400. But the gain is in excess of the annual exemption. The strategy is to sell just enough of the holding to crystallise a taxable gain of just 11,100. The fraction, f, is given by fx70,00050,000  2xfx70,000  11,100 ... which simplifies to f  11,10018,600  59.68. The tax saved is 20x11,100  2,220, versus costs of 2x59.58x70,000  835.52. This strategy of partial bb is adopted because it never makes sense to pay tax early ! End."

If frontload the big payment, that saves 250 over paying monthly over the year. If you planned to save that money each month and pay it at the end, then it would cost you 250 more in mortgage interest. So thats how much money you would have to make with that saved money to offset the cost. Over the life of the loan the choice between the two equates to less than 5,000. If you pay monthly its easy to calculate that an extra 1,000month would reduce the loan to 17 years, 3 months. That would give you a savings of 400,000 at the cost of paying 207,000 extra during those 17 years. Many people would suggest that you invest the money instead because the annual growth rates of the stock market are well in excess of your 4.375 mortgage.

    "body": "Honestly, the best way to manage this risk is to manage your savings appropriately. Many experts recommend that maintain a reasonably liquid account with 69x your minimum monthly expenses for just this occurrence. I know, easier said than done. Right? As for insurance, I can only speak for what is the case in the US. Here, most mortgages will require you to get PMI insurance until you have at least 20 equity in your house. However, that insurance only protects the BANK from losing money if you cant pay. It doesnt save you from foreclosure or ruining your credit. Really, the type of insurance you are talking about is Unemployment insurance which all states in the US make available to workers via deductions from their paycheck. The best advice, I suppose, is to keep your expenses low enough to cover them with an unemployment check until you have accumulated enough savings to get through a rough patch. That may mean buying a less expensive home, or just waiting until you have saved a bigger down payment. If you didnt plan ahead, and you are already in the house, another option might be to extend your mortgage. For example from a 20 to a 30 year to reduce your payments to a manageable level. A more risky option might be to convert to a variable rate loan temporarily, which typically carries a lower interest rate. However, it might be hard to secure a new loan if you dont currently have an income."

However, there is no mandatory link between the federal reserve rate and the market rate. No law stipulates that rates cannot rise or fall. They will rise and fall as lenders see necessary to use their capital. Though a lender asking 10 interest might make no loans when others are willing to lend for 9. The only protection you have is that we are mostly economically free. As a borrower, you are protected by the fact that there are many lenders. Likewise, as a lender, because there are many borrowers. Stability is simply by virtue of the fact that one market participant with inordinate pricing will find fewer counterparties to transact."

What I ended up doing was investing the majority of my money in higher interest GICs Guaranteed Investment Certificate and keeping the rest in my chequingsavings account. I understand that GICs arent exactly the most liquid asset out there. However, instead of investing it all into 1 GIC, I put them in to smaller increments with varying lockin times and rollover options. I.e. for 15000 keep 3000 on hand in your account 2x1000 invested for 2 years 4x1000 invested for 1 year 3x1000 invested for 180 days 3x1000 invested for 90 days When you find that you run out of cash from your 3000, youll have a GIC expiring soon. The problem with GICs is that redeeming them before the maturity period usually incurs a penalty in the form of no interest. Keeping them in smaller increments allows you to redeem only the amount you need without losing too much interest. At maturity, if you dont need the money, you can just have the GIC renew. The other problem with GICs, is that interest rates, though better than savings accounts, arent that much more. Youre basically just fighting off inflation. The benefit is that on maturity, you are guaranteed your principal and the interest. This plan is easy to implement if your bankcredit union allows you to create and manage GICs online."

Im in favor of doing what lets you sleep well. Im also quick to point out that if you owe 2500 at 18, yet have 2500 in your emergency fund, youre really throwing away 450 in interest each year. Theres an ongoing debate of \"credit card as emergency fund.\" No, I dont claim that your cards should be considered an emergency fund, per se, but I would prioritize knocking off the 18 debt as a high priority.

One can choose to fund a Roth IRA, but keep the asset out of retirement calculations. Its simply an emergency account returning tax free interest, and if never used, it eventually is retirement money. A Roth permits withdrawal of deposited funds with no tax or penalty, just tracking it each year. This actually rubs some people the wrong way as it sounds like tapping your retirement account for emergencies. For my purpose, its a tax free emergency fund. Not retirement, unless and until you are saving so much in the 401k you need more tax favored retirement money. I wrote an article some time ago, the Roth Emergency Fund which went into a bit more detail. Last  keep in mind, this is my opinion. I can intelligently argue my case, but at some point, its up to the individual to do what feels right. Paying 18 debt off a bit slower, say 4 years instead of 3, in favor of funding the matched 401k, to me, you run the numbers, watch the 401k balance grow by 2X your pretax deposits, and see that in year 3, your retirement account is jumpstarted and far, far more than your remaining 18 cards.

Reduction in risk without any loss in returnsvery nonlinear. Nonlinear case 2 If you are changing the weights in your portfolio to move along the efficient frontier, then you the riskreward relation is a hyperbola, which is nonlinear. Nonlinear case 3 If you are changing the weights in your portfolio to move away from the efficient frontier, then you increase risk without adding a fully compensatory amount of return. There could be many paths along the riskreward plane, but generally it will not be linear in the sense that it will not be on the same line as your initial, efficient, portfolio and your savings account. Linear case 1 The most common sense in which we think of the riskreward relation being linear is when the thing you are changing is the size of your investment. If you take money out of savings to put in your fully diversified portfolio without changing the relative weights, your expected returns will increase linearly. Linear case 2 If you believe the CAPM, then the expected return of an asset stock is linearly proportional to the market risk of the firm. If you could change the market risk of a single asset without changing anything else, then you would linearly change its expected return.

As you might know, the variance of the log stock price in Black Scholes is vol2  T, in other words, variance of the log stock price is linear in time to expiry. Now, that means that the standard deviation of your log stock price is square root in time. This is consequential. For normally distributed random variables, in 68 of cases we end up within one standard deviation. So, basically, we expect our log stock price to be within something something times square root of T. So, if your stock has a vol of 16, itll be plusminus 32 in 4 years, plusminus 16 for one year, plusminus 8 for 3m, plusminus 4 for 3ish weeks, and plusminus 1 for a business day. As you see, the decay is slow at first, but much more rapid as we get closer. How does the square root function look? Its a sideways parabola. As we come closer to zero, the slope of the square root function goes to infinity.

    "body": "Please dont waste any more time feeling bad for merchants for the charges they incur. I dont know who supported the lobby for this rule, but issuers no longer can demand that merchants accept all transactions even the unprofitable ones. I discussed this at length on my blog. Merchants accept credit cards for one reason, and one reason only it brings them more business. More people will buy, and on average theyll buy more. They used to take the occasional hit for someone buying a pack of gum with a credit card, but they dont have to anymore. The new law restricts issuers from imposing minimum transactions that are less than 10. I use a rewards card wherever possible. I get a cheaper price. In most cases I dont care what the merchant has to pay. Theyve already factored it into their prices. But if you are concerned, then as fennec points out in his comment, cash is the way to go."

In general, if you discard records in a period of time less than your tax authority recommends, it may create audit problems down the road. ie if you make a deduction supported by business expense receipts, and you discard those receipts next year, then you wont be able to defend the deduction if your tax authority audits you in 3 years. Generally, how long you keep records would depend on a how much time your tax authority has to audit you and b how long after you file your return you are allowed to make your own amendments. In your case USbased, the IRS has straightforward documentation about how long it expects you to keep records httpswww.irs.govbusinessessmallbusinessesselfemployedhowlongshouldikeeprecords Period of Limitations that apply to income tax returns Keep records for 3 years if situations 4, 5, and 6 below do not apply to you. Keep records for 3 years from the date you filed your original return or 2 years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later, if you file a claim for credit or refund after you file your return. Keep records for 7 years if you file a claim for a loss from worthless securities or bad debt deduction. Keep records for 6 years if you do not report income that you should report, and it is more than 25 of the gross income shown on your return. Keep records indefinitely if you do not file a return. Keep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return. Keep employment tax records for at least 4 years after the date that the tax becomes due or is paid, whichever is later. Note that the above are the minimum periods to keep records for your own purposes you may want to keep them for longer periods than that. For example, you may be in a position to discover that you would like to refile a prior tax return, because you forgot to claim a tax credit that was available to you.

    "body": "I think your approach of looking exclusively at USD deposits is a prudent one. Here are my responses to your questions. 1 It is highly unlikely that a USD deposit abroad be converted to local currency upon withdrawal. The reason for offering a deposit in a particular currency in the first place is that the bank wants to attract funds in this currency. 2 Interest rate is a function of various risks mostly supply and demand, central bank policy, perceived risk etc. In recent years lowinterest rate policy as led by U.S., European and Japanese central banks has led particularly low yields in certain countries disregarding their level of risk, which can vary substantially thus e.g. Eastern Europe has very low yields at the moment in spite of its perceived higher risk. Some countries offer depository insurance. 3 I would focus on banks which are among the largest in the country and boast good corporate governance i.e. their ownership is clean and transparent and they are true to their business purpose. Thus, ownership is key, then come financials. Country depository insurance, low external threat low war risk is also important. Most banks require a personal visit in order to open the account, thus I wouldnt split much further than 23 banks, assuming these are good quality."

Canadian importers will have to buy RMB typically with CAD to pay for their orders and Canadian exporters can take payment in RMB if they wish, or set prices in CAD. By avoiding the US dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs. Japan did this many decades ago they, too, used to price their products in USD. This is important in transactions of large amounts, not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism. Twoway annual trade between China and Canada is in excess of 70bn.

Another argument is that the economy has a longterm upward trajectory thats the assumption. So each generation, as a whole, has more disposable real income than the previous.

As the time frame increases the efficiency of algorithmic trading decreases and proper investment strategies such as due diligence, stock screening, and technical analysis become the more efficient methods. Algorithms become less effective as the time frame increases due to the smoothing effect of volatility over time. Writing an algorithm that could predict future longterm prices would be an impossible feat because as the time frame is scaled up there are far less price fluctuations and trends volatility smooths out and so there is little to no benchmark for the formulas. An algorithm simply wouldnt make sense for a longterm position. A computer cant predict, say, the next quarter, an ousted CEO, a buyout, or anything else that could effect the price of the security, never mind the psychology behind it all. Vice versa, researching a companys fundamentals just to bank on a 0.25 daily swing would not be efficient.

    "body": "Anytime you do work without any payment until the work is complete, you are effectively extending credit to the party receiving your service. How much credit you are willing to extend will vary greatly, depending on the amount and the trustworthiness of the party. For example, if you are charging 50 for something, you probably wont bother to collect money upfront, whereas if you are charging 5,000 you probably would collect some upfront. But if the party you are working for is a large financially sound company, the number may be even much higher than 5K as you can trust you will be paid. Obviously there are many factors that go into how much credit you are willing to extend to your customer. This is why credit reports exist for banks to determine how much credit to extend to you. As for the specific case you are asking about, which may be classified as a decent amount of work for a small business, I would default to having a written scope of work, a place in the document for both parties to sign, and specify 50 upfront payment and 50 payment at completion. When you receive the signed document and the upfront payment and possibly even after the check clears, you begin work. I would call this my \"default contract\" and adjust according to your needs depending on the size of the job and the trustworthiness of the customer. As for your question about how to deposit the check, that depends on what type of entity you are. If you are a sole proprietor you should ask for the checks to be made out to you. If you are a business then the checks should be made out to your business name. You dont need \"in trust\" or anything similar because your customer, after paying the upfront fee, must trust that you will do the work you promise to do, just like you have to trust that after completing the work you will receive the final payment. This is the reason the default is 50 before and after. Both parties are risking roughly the same amount. Tip having done the \"default\" contract many times in my career, both as a sole proprietor and a business owner, I can assure you there is a big difference between a potential customer agreeing to something in advance, and actually writing a check. The upfront payment definitely helps weed out those that were never going to end up paying you, even if their intentions were good. Tip 2 be as specific as possible as to what the scope of work will include. If you dont, particularly with software, theyll be adding feature after feature and expecting it to be \"included\"."

Instead of some number of shares of each new company, imagine for this example its one for one. i.e. One share of company A becomes a share each in company B and company C. This tell us nothing about relative valuation, right? Was B worth 12 of the original company A, or some other fraction? Say it is exactly a 5050 split. Company A releases a statement that B and C each should have 12 the cost basis of your original A shares. Now, B and C may very well trade ahead of the stock splitting, as when issued shares. At no point in time will B and C necessarily trade at exactly the same price, and the day that B and C are officially trading, with no more A shares, they may have already diverged in price. That is, theres nothing you can pull from the trading data to identify that the basis should have been assigned as 50 to each new share. This is my very longwinded was of explaining that the company must issue a notice through your broker, and on their investor section of their web site, to spell out the way you should assign your basis to each new stock."

Otherwise the insurance company would have higher rates to make a profit. In the case of Apple Care there can arguably be other factors involved. If you did not insure your 2000 laptop and it broke unfixably just after the warranty period, would you replace it with a new Apple product? Maybe not, so Apple could lose a customer. That means they have an incentive to keep you happy. If your product breaks but insurance replaces it, you are a happier customer and more likely to buy other Apple products. This is not an incentive for traditional insurance companies that only do business in insurance. Now, with the profit margins Apple likes in general, I dont know if theyve underpriced their insurance. I sort of doubt it even. But their margins on it are probably not high, meaning its a closer call even if you are only averagely risky."

Whereas your ten used to be worth 100 of the price of bottle of wine, they now are worth 50 of the risen price of a bottle of wine so theyve lost around 50 of their value. Divide the old price by the new inflated price to measure proportionally how much the old price is of the new price. 10 divided by 20 is 12 or .50 or 50. You can then subtract the old price from the new in proportional terms to find how much value youve lost. 1 minus 12 or 1.00 minus .50 or 100 minus 50."

However, I can speak about the US of A. To your first point relatively few people inherit their wealth. According to a brief web search about 38 of billionaires, and 20 of millionaires inherited their wealth. The rest are selfmade. Again, in the US, income mobility is very common. Some act like high level earners are just born that way, but studies have shown that a great deal of income mobility exists. I personally know people that have grown up without indoor plumbing, and extremely poor but now earn in the top 5 of wage earners. Quids points are valid. For example a Starbucks, new IPhone, and a brake job on your car are somewhat catastrophic if your income is 50Kyear, hurts if your income is 100K, and an inconvenience if you make 250Kyear. These situations are normal and happen regularly. The first person may have to take a pay day loan to pay for these items, the second credit card interest, the third probably has the money in the bank. All of this exaggerates the effect of an \"emergency\" on ones net worth. To me there is also a chickenandegg effect in wealth building and income. How does one build wealth? By investing wisely, planning ahead, budgeting, delaying gratification, finding opportunities, etc... Now if you take those same skills to your workplace isnt it likely you will receive more responsibility, promotions and raises? I believe so. And this too exaggerates the effect on ones net worth. If investing helps you to earn more, then you will have more to invest. To me one of the untold stories of this graph is not just investing, but first building a stable financial base. Having a sufficient emergency fund, having enough and the right kind of insurance, keeping loans to a minimum. Without doing those things first investments might need to be withdrawn, often at an inopportune time, for emergency purposes. Thanks for asking this!"

In some cases an exception occurs, but only when the SCorp was formally a CCorp and the CCorp had nondistributed earnings or losses. This is a separate issue whereas the undistributed CCorp gainslosses are treated differently than the SCorp gainslosses.

Avalanche is more financially optimal but less immediately gratifying.

    "body": "If you dont have the time or interest to manage investments, you need a financial advisor. Generally speaking, youre better served by an advisor who collects an annual fee based on a percentage of your account value. Advisors who are compensated based on transactions have a vested interest to churn your account, which is often not in your best interest. You also need to be wary of advisors who peddle expensive mutual funds with sales loads aka kickbacks to the advisor or annuities. Your advisors compensation structure should be transparent as well."

    "header": "Is it accurate to say that if I was to trade something, my probability of success cant be worse than random?",
    "body": "The stock market is not a zerosum game. Some parts are forex, some option trading, but plain old stock trading is not zero sum. That is to say, if you were to invest \"at random\", you would on average make money. Thats because the market as a whole makes money  it goes up over time 610 annually, averaged over time. Thats because youre not just gambling when you buy a stock youre actually contributing money to a company directly or indirectly, which it uses to fund activities that on average make money. When you buy Caterpillar stock, youre indirectly funding Caterpillar building tractors, which they then sell for a profit, and thus your stock appreciates in value. While not every company makes a profit, and thus not every stock appreciates in true value, the average one does. To some extent, buying index funds is pretty close to \"investing at random\". It has a far lower risk quotient, of course, since youre not buying a few stocks at random but instead are buying all stocks in an index but buying stocks from the SP 500 at random would on average give the same return as VOO with way more volatility. So for one, you definitely could do worse than 5050 if you simply sold the market short sold random stocks short, you would lose money over time on average, above and beyond the transaction cost, since the market will go up over time on average. Secondly, there is the consideration of limited and unlimited gains or losses. Some trades, specifically some option trades, have limited potential gains, and unlimited potential losses. Take for example, a simple call option. If you sell a naked call option  meaning you sell a call option but dont own the stock  for 100, at a strike price of 20, for 100 shares, you make money as long as the price of that stock is under 21. You have a potential to make 100, because thats what you sold it for if the price is under 20, its not exercised, and you just get that 100, free. But, on the other hand, if the stock goes up, you could potentially be out any amount of money. If the stock trades at 24, youre out 400100  300, right? Plus transaction costs. But what if it trades at 60? Or 100? Or 10000? Youre still out 100  that amount, so in the latter case, 1 million. Its not likely to trade at that point, but it could. If you were to trade \"at random\", youd probably run into one of those types of situations. Thats because there are lots of potential trades out there that nobody expects anyone to take  but that doesnt mean that people wouldnt be happy to take your money if you offered it to them. Thats the reason your 16.66 vs 83.33 argument is faulty youre absolutely right that if there were a consistently losing line, that the consistently winning line would exist, but that requires someone that is willing to take the losing line. Trades require two actors, one on each side if youre willing to be the patsy, theres always someone happy to take advantage of you, but you might not get a patsy."

    "body": "Its a good question, I am amazed how few people ask this. To summarise is it really worth paying substantial fees to arrange a generic investment though your high street bank? Almost certainly not. However, one caveat You didnt mention what kind of funds you want to invest in, or for how long. You also mention an advice fee. Are you actually getting financial advice  i.e. a personal recommendation relating to one or more specific investments, based on the investments suitability for your circumstances  and are you content with the quality of that advice? If you are, it may be worth it. If theyve advised you to choose this fund that has the potential to achieve your desired returns while matching the amount of risk you are willing to take, then the advice could be worth paying for. It entirely depends how much guidance you need. Or are you choosing your own fund anyway? It sounds to me like you have done some research on your own, you believe the building society adviser is trying to sell a fund and you arent entirely convinced by their recommendation. If you are happy making your own investment decisions and are merely looking for a place to execute that trade, the deal you have described via your bank would almost certainly be poor value  and youre looking in the right places for an alternative.    On to the activevspassive fund debate That AMC of 1.43 you mention would not be unreasonable for an actively managed fund that you strongly feel will outperform the market. However, you also mention ETFs a passive type of fund and believe that after charges they might offer at least as good net performance as many actively managed funds. Good point  although please note that many comparisons of this nature compare passives to all actively managed funds the good and bad, including e.g. poorly managed life company funds. A better comparison would be to compare the fund managers youre considering vs. the benchmark  although obviously this is past performance and wont necessarily be repeated. At the crux of the matter is cost, of course. So if youre looking for lowcost funds, the cost of the platform is also significant. Therefore if you are comfortable going with a passive investment strategy, lets look at how much that might cost you on the platform you mentioned, Hargreaves Lansdown. Two of the most popular FTSE AllShare tracker funds among Hargreaves Lansdown clients are Youll notice they have slightly different performance btw. Thats a funny thing with trackers. They all aim to track but have a slightly different way of trading to achieve it. To hold either of these funds in a Hargreaves Lansdown account youll also pay the 0.45 platform charge this percentage tapers off for portolio values higher than 250,000 if you get that far. So in total to track the FTSE All Share with these funds through an HL account you would be paying This gives you an indication of how much less you could pay to run a DIY portfolio based on passive funds. NB. Both the above are a 100 equities allocation with a large UK companies weighting, so wont suit a lower risk approach. Youll also end up invested indiscriminately in eg. mining, tobacco, oil companies, whoevers in the index  perhaps youd prefer to be more selective. If you feel you need financial advice with Nationwide or portfolio management with Nutmeg you have to judge whether these services are worth the added charges. It sounds like youre not convinced! In which case, all the best with a lowcost passive funds strategy."

    "body": "Social security and pensions make up a big part of it. You may want to look at the source of the data. If a person, has 5K at Vanguard, 5K at Fidelity and 100K at the bank Fidelity will report on that person as having only 5K. Vanguard will do the same. The opening pitch of a life insurance salesman sometimes includes the \"100 man story\". Before retirement age 26 of people will die, 54 will be broke, 5 will work, 4 will be secure, and 1 will be wealthy. Then they sell you life insurance which is a horrible product for retirement savings. If you further dig into this subject you will find a great disparity between the mean and median retirement savings. That is because many Americans have none, and those that do skew the average upward and have no where near mean or average. Its like this with other things in personal finance. For example those with actual credit card debt have much higher than the average. As those with none, or even no credit cards skew the average downward. In my opinion it is like this because of behavior. If one saved half of the average car payment over their working life in a growth stock mutual fund, they would make it to that 4 category. If they also had a good salary, kept debt to a minimum, and saved a healthy amount they would make it to that 1 category. It was a daily choice that was made many years prior to retirement."

Say, on the Ask side there are 100,000 shares, all with 10 ask. It would take a lot of orders to purchase all these shares, so for a while, the price may stay right at 10, or a bit lower if there are those willing to sell lower. But, say that side showed 10 1000, 10.25 500, 10.50 1000. Now, the volume is so low that if I decided I wanted shares at any price, my order, a market order will actually drive the market price right up to 10.50 if I buy 2500 shares \"market\". You see, however, even though Im a small trader, I drove the price up. But now that the price is 10.50 when I go to sell all 2500 at 10.50, there are no bids to pay that much, so the price the next trade will occur at isnt known yet. There may be bids at 10, with asking me at 10.50. No trades will happen until a seller takes the 10 bid or other buyers and sellers come in."

Social Security Disability Insurance which you indicate you have is insurance you can receive benefit from if you earn enough \"work credits\" payroll taxes prior to your disability onset. It is not a needsbased program. Supplemental Security Income is a needbased program which does not consider your work history. To qualify for this, your total assets need to be lower than some threshold and your family income also below some threshold. If you inherit a home, or money, I doubt this would jeopardize your SSDI qualification, since your qualification was based on a disabling condition and work history. If you inherit an income property, which you manage i.e. you become a landlord, this may jeopardize your claim that you are unable to work. Even if you are not making an \"income\" as the landlord, but the work your are performing is deemed to have some \"value\" this too could jeopardize your claim. All of this can be very complicated, and there are some excellent references on the web including SSA website, and some other related websites. Finally, if you become able to work while on SSDI, your benefit maywill end depending on the level of work you are able to perform. But just because you are able to work again does not mean you need to repay past benefits received assuming your condition has not been falsified.

    "header": "logistical details of interest and dividend payments on assets traded on the secondary market?",
    "body": "To Many question and they are all treated differently. I was wondering how the logistics of interest and dividend payments are handled on assets , such as mortgages, bonds, stocks, What if the owner is some highfrequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second? When the company decides to pay dividends, does it literally track down every single owner of that stock and deposit x cents per share in that persons bank account? This sounds absolutely absurd and seems like it would be a logistical nightmare. In Stocks, the dividends are issued periodically. The dividend date is declared well in advance. As on end of the day on Dividend date, the list of individuals [or entities] who own the stock is available with the StockExchange  Registrar of the companies. To this list the dividends are credited in next few days  weeks via banking channel. Most of this is automated. What if the owner is some highfrequency algorithm that buys and sells bonds and stocks in fractions of a second? On bonds, things work slightly differently. An Bond is initially issued for say 95 [discount of 5] and payment of 100 after say 5 years. So when the person sells it after an year, he would logically look to get a price of 96. Of course there are other factors that could fetch him a price of 94.50 or 95.50. So every change in ownership factors in the logical rate of interest. The person who submits in on maturity gets 100. For the homeowner, Im assuming he  she still makes mortgage payments to the initial bank they got the mortgage from, even if the bank no longer \"owns\" the mortgage. In this case, does the trader on the secondary market who owns the mortgage also come back to that bank to collect his interest payment? This depends on how the original financial institution sells the mortgage to new institutions. Generally the homeowner would keep paying initial financial institution and they would then take a margin and pay the secondary investor. If this was collateralized as Mortgage backed security, it is a very different story."

    "body": "First, if it is in any way a joint account, the debt usually goes to the surviving person. Assets in joint accounts usually have their own instructions on how to disperse the assets for example, full joint bank accounts usually immediately go to the other name on the account and never become part of the estate. Noncash assets will likely need to be converted to cash and a fair market valuation shown to the probate court, unless the debts can be paid without using them and they can be transferred to next of kin. If, after that, the deceased has any assets at all, there is usually varies by state a legally defined order in which debtor types must be paid. This is handled by probating the estate. There is a period during which you publish a death notice and then wait for debt claims and bills to arrive. Then pay as many as possible based on the priority, and inform the others the holder is deceased and the estate is empty. This sometimes needs to be approved by a judge if the assets are less than the debts. Then disperse remaining assets to next of kin. If there are no assets held by just the deceased, as you get bills you just send a certified copy of the death certificate, tell them there is no estate, then forget about them. A lawyer can really help in determining which need to be paid and to work through probate, which is not simple or cheap. But also note that you can negotiate and sometimes get them to accept less, if there are assets. When my mother died, the doctors treating her zeroed her accounts the hospitals accepted a much reduced total, but the credit cards wanted 100."

    "body": "I love Johns answer, but I just cant help myself from adding my 2 cents, even though its over 5 years later. I sold cars for a while in the late 90s, and I mostly agree with Johns answer. Where I disagree though, is that where I worked, the salesperson did not have ANY authority to make a sale. A sales manager was required to sign off on every sale. That doesnt mean that the manager had to interact with the buyer, that could all be handled behind the scenes, but the pricing and even much of the negotiating strategies were dictated by the sales managers. Some of the seasoned salespeople would estimate numbers on their own, but occasionally youd hear the managers still chew them out with \"I wish you wouldnt have said that\". Of course, every dealership is different. Additional purchase advice There is a strategy that can work well for the buyer, but only in scenarios where the salesperson is trying to prevent you from leaving. They may start interrupting you as you are packing up, or blocking your path to the door, or even begging. If this happens, they are obviously desperate for whatever reason. In this case, if you came prepared with research on a good price that you are comfortable with, then shoot lower and hold firm to the point of near exhaustion. Not so low that that they realize youre too far away they will let you leave at that point. It needs to be within a reasonable amount, perhaps at most 12 of the purchase price. Once you detect the salesperson is desperate, you finally move up to your goal number or possibly a little lower. Typically the salesperson will be so happy to have gotten you to move at all that theyll accept. And if the managers are fed up too like 45 minutes after close, theyll accept too. I saw this happen multiple times in a high pressure scenario. I also used it once myself as a buyer. If you are planning to purchase options that can be added at the dealer rather than from the factory, keep them up your sleeve at first. Get your negotiations down to where you are a little further apart than the invoice price of the option, then make your move. For example, suppose the option you want retails for 350 with an invoice of 300. Get within about 400 of the dealer. Then offer to pay their price, but only if they throw in the option you want. This will throw them completely off guard because they didnt expect it and all of their calculations were based on without it. If they say yes, you effectively moved 100 and they moved 300. Its much more likely that theyll agree to this than taking 300 off the price of the car. Im guessing the reason for this is partially due to how their accounting works with sticker price vs aftermarket price, and partially psychological. Note, this works best with new cars, and make sure you only do this if its for items they can add after the fact. Even if they dont have the part in stock its ok, they can give you an IOU. But if the option requires a car change to something they dont have on the lot, it will probably just make them mad."

    "body": "How are derivatives like covered warrants or CFDs different from the bucket shops that were made illegal in the US? After reading up a little on the topic, the core difference seems to be that bucket shops were basically running betting pools, with everyone betting against the operator, whereas CFDs and similar derivatives are traded between speculators and the operator merely provides a market and checks the liquidity of participants. A CW seems to be a different matter that Im not fully sure I understand at least the description of Wikipedia seems to contradict your statement about not trade being performed on the underlying security. Should I worry that some regulator decides that my \"market maker\" is an illegal gambling operation? Not really. Nations with a mature financial industry like Japan invariably have heavy regulations that mandate constant auditing of institutions that sell financial instruments. In Japan, the Financial Services Agency is in charge of this. Its almost impossible that they would let an institution operate and later decide that its basic business model is illegal. What is possible are mainly two scenarios"

    "body": "Yes you can do that and it it wise to do so. However, you should make sure that the general trend of the stock is upwards and you buy during a trought in the uptrend. So basically if the stock is making higher highs and higher lows on the daily or weekly charts, then you would want to buy around one of the higher lows before the exdividend date. If the stock is making lower lows and lower highs, then it is in a downtrend, so never buy in this instance. It is better to miss out on a dividend of 1 rather than to buy just for this 1 dividend and lose 5 or more when the price continues to drop further."

    "body": "My parents and I were suckered into buying this kind of thing when I was in high school. The sales people literally told us that it could be used to pay off student loans  they left out the \"in the event of your death\" part. We knew it was a life insurance policy, but were told that it would \"mature\" 6 months after graduation from college, and that it would then be disbursed to pay off loans, even if I didnt die. That seemed strange to us, so we explicitly asked several different ways whether it would pay off the loans after graduation, even if I lived, and they just straight up told us, \"Yes.\" Im guessing this ploy is still being used. Also, last I checked, student loans are nontransferable in the unfortunate event that your child dies  which means the loan is forgiven anyway  so this whole thing seems like garbage to me, at least in the student loan sense. I would steer clear from this stuff  its pure snake oil in my experience."

    "body": "The stores track the individual items for inventory planning and marketing purposes. Having worked in the transaction processing business for a time writing one, I can say with confidence that the creditdebit card companies do not receive an itemized list of the items involved in the transaction. There is usually a description field in the information transmitted to the processor, which may or may not contain useful information. But it is not big enough to contain an itemized grocery list of any size. And it is not standardized in any way that would facilitate reliable parsing. There may be an amount of metadata about the transaction that would indicate the types of products involved in the transaction, which they can also infer from the merchant reporting the transaction. There are efforts to increase the amount of data reported, but they are not widely used yet, due to the overwhelming numbers of banks that would need to be upgraded. These efforts are rolling out only in specific and limited uses where the banks involved are willing to upgrade software and equipment. For now, the best way to know what you bought is to keep your receipts from the store. Shoeboxes work great for this. So do smartphone cameras and a folder on your hard drive. There are also mobile apps that track receipts for you, and may even try to OCR the data for you."

    "body": "This BBC article says that nuclear power notes came about when the French energy company EDF purchased British Energy in 2008 The note changes in value with wholesale energy prices and power output levels from British Energys existing nuclear stations. EDF Energys website describes these notes under the section titled \"Nuclear Power Notes\" When EDF acquired British Energy in January 2009, Nuclear Power Notes were issued to British Energy shareholders who chose to take them in lieu of 74 pence of cash per British Energy share held. The Nuclear Power Notes are ten year financial instruments 2009  2019 which give ex British Energy shareholders a continuing interest in the EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Fleet. They are traded on the ICAP Securities  Derivatives Exchange formerly known as the PLUS Quoted exchange. Each year a predefined calculation is performed to determine whether any cash will be paid to Nuclear Power Note holders. The calculation is dependent on the nuclear output of the EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Fleet Eligible Nuclear Output and market power prices Power Prices. This calculation may or may not result in a cash payment each year to Nuclear Power Note holders. The MWhTWh are figures you see are measures of watthours, i.e. energy output. The value of nuclear power notes is tied to this output. Looking at the most recent statement June 2013, you can see a line that looks like this Month Ahead Price in respect of July 2013 47.46 GBPMWh which is an energy spot price for the output of the nuclear plants. Im not entirely sure of the relationship between this and the payment to shareholders, but if you look at the 2012 Yearly Payment Calculation Notice on the same page, youll see this in the first section a the Yearly Payment for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012, the Relevant Year  payable in respect of each CVR on 31 January 2013 shall be zero The payments were also zero for 2010 and 2011. The 2009 calculation notice, however, states that a the Yearly Payment for the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009, the Relevant Year payable in respect of each CVR on 31 January 2010 shall be 11.497164 pence stated to 6 decimal places I presume that payment would have appeared in whatever account holds these notes, e.g. your brokerage account. Technically, the financial statements above refer to a Contingent Value Rights CVR instrument, which is a derivative linked to the Nuclear Power Notes. This site sums it up better than I can The British Energy CVRs were created by the issue of nuclear power notes NPNs to the targets shareholders who opted to take up this alternative. The NPNs were issued by Barclays Bank plc and were linked to guaranteed contingent value rights instruments that were issued to Barclays by EDFs acquisition vehicle Lake Acquisitions and which were ultimately guaranteed by EDF Energy plc Lake CVRs. Barclays is required to make yearly payments to noteholders for 10 years, the amount of which is limited to the corresponding amount paid by Lake Acquisitions to Barclays for the Lake CVRs. Basically, there is a chain of payments through these derivatives that eventually links back to nuclear energy output."

    "body": "What is a good resource to learn about options trading strategies? Options are a quite advanced investment form, and youd do well to learn a lot about them before attempting to dive into this fairly illiquid market. Yales online course in financial markets covers the Options Market and is a good starting point to make sure youve got all the basics. You may be familiar with most of it, but its a decent refresher on lingo and BlackScholes. How can I use options to establish some cash flow from long standing investments while minimizing capital gains expenses? This question seems designed to get people to talk about covered calls. Essentially, you sell call contracts you let people buy things you already have at a price in the future, at their whim. They pay you for this option, though usually not much if the options arent in the money. You can think of this as trading any return above the call option for a bit of extra cash. I dont invest with taxable accounts, but there are significant tax consequences for options. Because they expire, there will be turnover in your portfolio, and up front income when you take the sell side. So if you trade in options with close expiration dates, youll probably end up with a lot of shortterm capital gains, which are treated as normal income. One strategy is to trade in broadbased stock index options, which have favorable tax treatments. Some people have abused this though to disguise normal income as capital gains, so it could go away. Obviously the easy approach is to just use a tax advantaged account for options trading. An ETF might also be able to handle the turnover on your behalf, for example VIX is a series of options on SP500 options. A second strategy Ive heard of is buying calls and puts at a given strike price. For example, if you bought Dec 13 calls and puts on SPX  115 today, it would cost you about 35 dollars. If the price moves more than 35 dollars away from 115 by DEC 13 in either direction, youve made a profit. If you reflect on that for a bit, youll see why VIX is considered a volatility index. I guess I should mention that shorting a stock and buying a put option at the market price are very similar, with the exception that your loss is limited to the price of the option. Is there ever an instance where options investing is not speculative? The term speculative is not well defined. For many people, the answer is no. Its very easy to just buy put options and wait for prices to fall, or call options and wait for prices to rise. Moreover, the second strategy above essentially gives you similar performance to a stock without paying full price. These all fall under the headline of increasing a risk portfolio rather than decreasing it, which I figure is a decent definition of speculation. On the other hand, there are ways to use options minimize risk rather than increase it. You can buy underwater options as portfolio insurance, if your portfolio drops below a certain amount, you still have the right to sell it at a higher one. And the CaseSchiller index is run in part, on the hopes that one day there might be a thriving market for real estate options or futures. When you buy a home or lend money to someone to buy one, you could buy regional CaseSchiller options to protect you if the regional market tanks. But in all of these cases, its required for someone else to take the opposite trade. Risk isnt reduced, its traded around. So technically, there is a speculative element to these as well. I think the proper question here is whether speculation is present, but whether speculation can be put to good ends. Without speculators, the already very thin market for options would shrivel faster."

    "body": "Its probably important to understand what a credit score is. A credit score is your history of accruing debt and paying it back. It is supplemented by your age, time at current residence, time at previous residences, time at your job, etc. A person with zero debt history can still have a decent score  provided they are well established, a little older and have a good job. The top scores are reserved for those that manage what creditors consider an \"appropriate\" amount of debt and are well established. In other words, youre good with money and likely have long term roots in the community. After all, creditors dont normally like being the first one you try out... Being young and having recently moved you are basically a \"flight risk\". Meaning someone who is more likely to just pick up and move when the debt becomes too much. So, you have a couple options. The first is to simply wait. Keep going to work, keep living where you are, etc. As you establish yourself you become less of a risk. The second is to start incurring debt. Personally, I am not a fan of this one. Some people do well by getting a small credit card, using some portion of it each month and paying it off immediately. Others dont know how to control that very well and end up having a few months where they roll balances over etc which becomes a trap that costs them far more than before. If I were in your position, Id likely do one of two things. Either buy the phone outright and sign up for a regular mobile plan OR take the cheaper phone for a couple years."

    "header": "does interest payment on loan stay the same if I pay early",
    "body": "It depends on the type of loan. Fully amortized loans have a schedule of payments dont recalculate as you pay. If you want to make an additional payment you need to contact the lender to apply your payment toward principle and reamortize the loan. Otherwise all your additional payment will do is change the amount due on your next payment, or push out your next payment due date. Regarding interest calculation, you owe interest on the principle outstanding. Say you have a 10 year loan 120 Months, at 5 APR, and a 1,000 payment this means you borrowed roughly 94,000 Each month the amount of interest owed reduces because there is less principle outstanding. The reason loans are amortized like this is so the borrower has a predictable, known, monthly amount due."

If it could be accomplished, but at a high cost, lets assume its based on principal and not monetary gain. And have a legal entitlement to money back? No. You are of course welcome to send your doctor a letter stating that you would like 50 to make up for your two hour wait last time around, but theres no legal obligation for him to pay up, unless he signed a contract stating that he would do so. Corporations also cannot simply send you a fine or fee and expect you to pay it you must have either agreed to pay it in the past, or now agree to pay it in exchange for something. In these cases, the corporations have the power you have to agree to their rules to play ball. However, consumers do have a significant power as well, in wellcompeted markets the power to do business with someone else. You dont like the restocking fee? Buy from Amazon, which offers free shipping on returns. You dont like paying a noshow fee from the doctor? Find a doctor without one or with a more forgiving fee, or with a low enough caseload that you dont have to make appointments early. Your ability to fine them exists as your ability to not continue to patronize them. In some markets, though, consumers dont have a lot of power  for example, cable television or other utilities. The FCC has a list of Customer Service Standards, which cable companies are required to meet, and many states have additional rules requiring penalties for missed or late appointments tougher than that. And, in the case of the doctor, if your doctor is late  find one that is. Or, try sending him a bill. It does, apparently, work from time to time  particularly if the doctor wants to keep your business."

    "body": "In such a situation, is there any reason, financial or not, to NOT pay as many points as mortgage seller allows? I can think of a few reasons not to buy points, in the scenario you described If interest rates decrease you could be better off refinancing to a lower rate than buying points now. If buying points reduced your down payment below 20 then the PMI would more than offset the benefit of having purchased points. Your situation changes and you arent able to stay in the home as long as planned. That said, current interest rates are pretty low, so Id probably gamble on them not getting too much lower anytime soon. I also assume that if you can afford as many points as they allow, that you wouldnt have to dip below 20 down payment even with points. Edit Others have mentioned that its important to note opportunity cost when calculating the benefit of purchasing points, I agree, you wouldnt want to buy points at a rate that saved you less than you could earn elsewhere. Personally, Ive not seen a points scenario that didnt yield more benefit than market average returns, but that could be due to my market, or just coincidence, you should definitely calculate the benefit for your scenario and shop for a good lender. Dont forget that points are tax deductible in the year paid when calculating their benefit."

That said, I had 2 years of returns well over 100. 1998, and 1999. The SP was up 26.7 and 19.5, and I was very leverage in high tech stock options. As others mentioned, leverage was key. Mark used the term gearing which I think is leverage. When 2000 started crashing, I had taken enough off the table to end the year down 12 vs the SP 10, but this was down from a near 50 gain in Q1 of that year. As the crash continued, I was no longer leveraged and havent been since. The last 12 years or so, Ive happily lagged the SP by a few basis points .04.02. Also note, Buffet has returned an amazing 15.9yr on average for the last 30 years vs the SP 11.4. 16 is far from 100. The last 10 year, however, his return was a modest 8.6, just .1 above the SP."

Subtract the sustenance extra from this to get your net pay increase. After that is when it gets trickier. Basically, you want to set aside or invest as much of the pay increase as possible, but you probably have other expenses now that you didnt before and which you cannot really do that much about. This mights be particular types of clothes, commute fares car keepup, gas, bus pass, ..., or something entirely different. Anyway, decide on a savings goal, as a percentage of your net pay increase compared to when you were a student. This might be 5, 10 or if you are really ambitious 50 or more. Whichever number you pick, make sure its reasonable giving your living expenses, and keep in mind that anything is better than nothing. Find a financial institution that offers a highinterest savings account, preferably one with free withdrawals, and sign up for one. Each and every time you get paid, figure out how much to save based on the percentage you determined if your regular case is that you get the same payment each time, you can simply set up an automated bank transfer, put that in the savings account and, for the moment, forget about that money. Try your best to live only on the remainder, but if you realize that you set aside too much, dont be afraid to tap into the savings account. Adjust your future deposits accordingly and try to find a good balance. At the end of each month, deposit whatever remains in your regular account into your savings account, and if that is a sizable amount of money, consider raising your savings goal a little. The ultimate goal should be that you dont need to tap into your savings except for truly exceptional situations, but still keep enough money outside of the savings account to cater to some of your wants. Yes, bank interest rates these days are often pretty dismal, and you will probably be lucky to find a savings account that especially after taxes will even keep up with inflation. But to start with, what you should be focusing on is not to make money in terms of real value appreciation, but simply figuring out how much money you really need to sustain a working life for yourself and then walking that walk. Eventually this may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year or more, you should have settled pretty well on an amount that you feel comfortable with setting aside each month and just letting be. By that time, you should have a decently sized nest egg already, which will help you get over rough spots, and can start thinking about other forms of investing some of what you are setting aside. Whenever you get a net pay raise of any kind gross pay raise, lower taxes, bonus, whichever, increase your savings goal by a portion of that raise. Maybe give yourself 60 of the raise and bank the remaining 40. That way, you are hopefully! always increasing the amount of money that you are setting aside, while also reaping some benefits right away. One major upside of this approach is that, if you lose your job, not only will you have that nest egg, you will also be used to living on less. So you will have more money in the bank and less monthly expenses, which puts you in a significantly better position than if you had only one of those, let alone neither."

    "body": "with 150K  to invest to \"become a landlord\" you have several options Pay for 100 of one property, and you then will make a significant percentage of the monthly rent as profit each month. That profit can be used to invest in other things, or to save to buy additional properties. At the end of the 21 years in your example, you can sell the flat for return of principal minus selling expenses, or even better make a profit because the property went up in value. Pay 20 down on 5 flats, and then make a much a smaller profit per flat each month due to the mortgage payment for each one. At the end of the 21 years sell the flats. Assuming that a significant portion of the mortgage is paid off each flat will sell for more than the mortgage balance. Thus you will have 5 nice large profits when you sell. something in between 1 and 5 flats. Each has different risks and expenses. With 5 rental properties you are more likely to use a management company, which will add to your monthly cost."

Very rarely do statements like this actually come from research, asking people why they bought or sold that day. Sometimes they may be right, but it is usually just story telling. In terms of old fashioned logic this is called the \"post hoc, ergo proper hoc\" fallacy. Now all the points people have raised about the US deficit may be valid, and there are plenty of reasons for worrying about the future of the world economy, but they were all known before the SP report, which didnt really provide the markets with much new information.

In the short term, a collapse in housing like the one we saw in 2008 can induce a spike in rental costs as people walk away or get foreclosed on, and move back into apartments. That then tends to selfadjust, as the people who had been in the apartments find a deal on a foreclosed house and move out. However, one thing Ive seen to be nearconstant in the apartment business is that a landlord will offer you a deal to get in, then increase the rent on you from year to year until you get fed up and move. This is a big reason I didnt have the same address for two years in a row until I bought my house. The landlord is basically betting that you wont want to deal with the hassle of moving, and so will pay the higher rent rate, even if, when you do the math, it makes more sense to move even to maintain the same rent rate. Eventually though, you do get fed up, look around, find the next good deal, and move, \"resetting\" your rent rate. I have never, not once in my life, seen or heard of any landlord offering a drop in rent as a \"loyalty\" move to keep you from going somewhere else. Its considered part of the game retailers will price match, but most service providers landlords, but also utility providers expect a large amount of \"churn\" in their customer base as people shop around.

Or more technically, it affects two or more accounts, and the total of the credits equals the total of the debits. Whether a debit or a credit adds or subtracts from the balance depends on the type of account. The types of accounts were defined so that it is always possible to have these matching debits and credits. Assets, like cash or property that you own, are \"debit accounts\", that is, a debit is an increase in the balance of the account. Liabilities, like money you owe, are \"credit accounts\", that is, a credit is an increase. To get into all the details would require giving a tutorial on doubleentry bookkeeping, which I think is beyond the scope of a forum post. By a quick Bing search I find this one httpsimplestudies.comdoubleentryaccountingsystem.html. I havent gone through it so I cant say if its a particularly good tutorial. There are plenty of others on the Web and in bookstores. Note that the terminology can be backwards when someone youre doing business with is describing the account, because their viewpoint may be the opposite of yours. For example, to me, my credit card is a liability I owe the bank money. So when I post a charge, thats a credit, and when I pay it off, thats a debit. But to the bank, my account is an asset the customer me owes them money. So to the bank, a charge is a debit and a payment is a credit."

Again this is for cash basis. Publication 538 states that \"under the cash method of accounting, you generally deduct business expenses in the tax year you pay them.\" I think the ruling above was meant to clarify when the expense is \"paid\". In my totally unofficial opinion, I suppose this makes sense. If I go to Office Depot to buy a box of envelopes, I walk out with the envelopes at the same time regardless of whether I paid cash or swiped a credit card. I wouldnt walk out thinking \"HA! I havent actually paid for these yet.\" If the shoplifting alarm went off at the door and I was asked if I had bought those, Id say yes, right?

You need to understand when you are going to need to make big purchases of homesapartmentscars so that you can ensure you arent doing this right before your credit score is being checked Need to leave 12 months without opening new accounts before doing this.

We have an unsecured credit line with Citibank that charges 14 and is capped at 10,000, and Discover Personal Loans charge around 14 as well in prepaid interest!. I would say, all things considering, that this is a great deal if you dont have a secured line of credit with a low interest rate. It is something, however, that if you arent diligent can get away from you. From my experience I would rather pay a small amount of interest while allowing my savings and retirement to grow interest hopefully greater than 35 than pay the huge expense and start from zero. But if you miss a single payment on a 0 APR balance transfer they charge you all back interest concessions plus charge you a penalty rate.

I can see your wanting to be fair but what is more important, school or fairly dividing the money? A 529 is money only for school.

If only one child goes to school, any money you give the other for starting their own business couldnt come from the 529 without big tax penalties. Depending on your position and finances you could state something like \"I will cover your college expenses up to 50K\" and then that is that.

Fees are highest for \"actively managed\" funds and lowest for passively managed funds or things where you choose the investments directly  but in the latter case you might pay out a lot in dealing fees. Typically pensions will have some small additional costs on top of that, but those are hugely outweighed by the tax advantages  payments into a pension are made from gross salary subject to an annual limit, and growth inside the pension is tax free. You do pay income tax when you take the money out though  but by then your marginal tax rate may well have dropped. If you want to control your own investments within a pension you can do this, subject to choosing the right provider  you dont have to be invested in the stockmarket at all my own pension isnt at the moment. I wrote an answer to another question a while ago which briefly summarises the options As far as an annuity goes, its not as simple as the company taking the money you saved when you die. The point of an annuity is that you cant predict when youll die. Simplifying massively, suppose the average life expectancy when you retire is 20 years and you have 100K saved, and ignore inflation and interest for now. Then on average you should have 5Kyear available  but since you dont know when youll die if you just spend your money at that rate you might run out after 20 years but still be alive needing money. Annuities provide a way of pooling that risk  in exchange for losing whats left if you die \"early\", you keep getting paid beyond what you put in if you die \"late\". Your suggestion of taking the dividends from an index tracker fund  or indeed the income from any other investment  is fine, but the income will be substantially less than an annuity bought with the same money because you wont be using up any capital, whereas an annuity implicitly does that. Depending on the type of investment, it might also be substantially more risky. Overall, you only need to secure the income you actually needwant to live on. Beyond that level, keeping your money outside the pension system makes some sense, though this might change with the new rules referred to in other answers that mean you dont have to buy an annuity if you have enough guaranteed income anyway. In any case, I strongly suggest you focus first on ensuring you have enough to live on in retirement before you worry about leaving an inheritance. As far as setting up a trust goes, you might be able to do that, but it would be quite expensive and the government tends to view trusts as tax avoidance schemes so you may well fall foul of future changes in the rules."

The risk derived from the situation you describe is one born out of behavior. Sometimes it is beyond control of the person attempting your scheme. Suppose one of these happen In my opinion the market is risky enough without borrowing money in order to invest. Its one thing to not pay extra principle to a mortgage in order to put that money in play in the market, it is another thing to do what you are suggesting. While their may be late fees associated with a mortgage payment, a fixed rate mortgage will not change if you late on payments. On these balance transfer CC schemes they will jack your rate up for any excuse possible. I read an article that the most common way to end up with a 23 credit card was to start out with a 0 balance transfer. One thing that is often overlooked is that the transfer fee paid jacks up the stated rate of the card. In the end, get out of consumer debt, have an emergency fund, then start investing.

This is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from  in the form of its own currency. We will continue with this analogy, if the central bank says these \"shares\" are worth 1, but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth 0.80 and decreasing, then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg, and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central banks solvency. People will know the 1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is, because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services, especially when it comes to imports. Shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor, which happens no matter what the governments punishments are for doing so. Swiss National Bank central bank did this in early 2015, as it experienced volatility in the Euro which it had previously been trying to keep its currency pegged to. It became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own. The central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve, such as selling a lot of foreign currency X, buying more of currency Y. They can and do take losses doing this. Swiss National Bank is maintaining a large loss They can also flood their economy with more of their currency, diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent. This is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds. People colloquially call this \"printing money\" but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools. The good and service goes onto the central banks balance book, and the companyentity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash another reading is that the bond is as good as cash. The bond didnt previously exist until the central bank said it did, and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds.

In general, a bond is what we called a fixed rate instrument. This means that for the life of the product, it will yield a fixed percentage of its face value at a regular period. Baring any extreme circumstances such as bankruptcy, no external factors will change the payment schedule on a bond. Conversely, by placing your money into a bank, you will accrue interest rate at some value related to some published interest rate. For example, if tomorrow, the Treasury decided to try to stimulate the economy, they could slash the interest rate, this would directly affect the rate at which your savings account would accrue interest. In general, a bond has a maturity date, where the capital is finally released from the bond. Until such date, you cannot access the money directly you can however sell the bond, but it would likely be at a discounted value. Therefore, in general, you cannot get access to the money whenever you want it. As for a saving account, normally one can access the funds instantly, if not within a few days. This seems to the reason people seem to be focusing on. For each bond, the issuer of the bond is obligated to pay you the holder of the bond fixed payments at an interval, plus the capital at the maturity. However, obligation does not mean guarantee. If the issuer, is unable to make the payments, they may go into bankruptcy to avoid paying you. There are companies setup to advise people on the likelihood of each bond issuer on their ability to honour their debts. For example Standard and Poor issues a rating which goes all the way up to AAA for bonds. Recently, many sovereign countries have lost their AAA rating from SP. Meaning that SP feel that the possibility of these countries going bankrupt is nonzero. Conversely, banks may also be unable to give you your money when requested. In the US, the reserve requirements means that at any one time it only holds 10 of the money it owes to its customers. This can mean that if every customer turns up to the bank to demand their money, that bank would be unable to pay. This situation is called a Bank Run. During such a situation, the bank would likely collapse and default. In many modern countries, the government put into place guarantees on the first xxx amount in saving accounts, but otherwise, your savings could be lost. There are many complex reasons to choose one instrument over another including some I have avoided, even if at the outset, they could appear to have the same rates."

    "body": "Generally speaking the lower credit score trumps. In the case you cite, the lower credit score will prevail. However, you may need to do exactly that in order to qualify for the loan income wise. There are two factors when obtaining a mortgage, really all loans, but more so with a mortgage the likeliness to repay credit score, and your ability to service the debt. This last one is a combination of income and debttoincome ratio. If you dont have enough income to qualify for the loan or fail to meet the debt to income ration, you may have to use your GFs income to qualify despite her poor credit. You might want to see past posts about buying property with nonspouses. It could work, but generally it requires a lot of legal work before closing on the deal. Avoiding this will lead to tales of woe."

The rephrasing of the question to a lendingreal estate executive such as myself, Id ask, whats the scenario? \"I would say youre looking for an Owner Occupied, Super Jumbo Loan with 20 Down or 360K down on the purchase price, 1.8 mil purchase price, Loan Amount is 1.45 mil. Fico is strong assumption. If this is your scenario, please see image. Yellow is important, more debt increases your backendDTI which is not good for the deal. As long as its less than 35, youre okay. Can someone do this loan, the short answer is yes. Its smart that you want to keep more cash on hand. Which is understandable, if the price of the property declines, youve lost your shirt and your down payment, then it will take close to 10 years to recover your down. Consider that you are buying at a peak in real estate prices. Prices cant go up more than they are now. Consider that properties peaked in 2006, cooled in 2007, and crashed in 2008. Properties declined for more than 2545 in 2008 regardless of your reasons of not wanting to come to the full 40 down, its a bit smarter to hold on to cash for other investments purposes. Just incase a recession does hit. In the end, if you do the dealYoull pay more in points, a higher rate compared to the 40 down scenario, the origination fee would increase slightly but youll keep your money on hand to invest elsewhere, perhaps some units that can help with the cashflow of your home. Ive highlighted in yellow what the most important factors that will be affected on a lower down payment. If your debt is low or zero, and income is as high as the scenario, with a fico score of at least 680, you can do the deal all day long. These deals are not uncommon in todays market. Rate will vary. Dont pay attention to the rate, the rate will fluctuate based on many variables, but its a high figure to give you an idea on total cost and monthly payment for qualification purposes, also to look at the DTI requirement for cashdebt.

    "body": "This was the day traders dilemma. You can, on paper, make money doing such trades. But because you do not hold the security for at least a year, the earnings are subject to short term capital gains tax unless these trades are done inside a sheltered account like a traditional IRA. There are other considerations as well wash sale rules and number of days to settle. In short, the glory days of rags to riches by day trading are long gone, if they were ever here in the first place. Edit the site will not allow me to add a comment, so I am putting my response here Possibly, yes. One big gotcha is that your broker reports the proceeds from your sales, but does not report your outflows from your buys. Then there is the risk you take by the broker refusing to sell the security until the transaction settles. Not to mention wash sale rules. You are trying to win at the buy low, sell high game. But you have a 25 chance, at best, of winning at that game. Can you pick the low? Maybe, but you have a 50 chance of being right. Then you have to pick the high. And again you have a 50 chance of doing that. 50 times 50 is 25. Warren Buffet did not get rich that way. Buffet buys and holds. Dont be a speculator, be a buy and hold investor. Buy securities, inside a sheltered account like a traditional IRA, that pay dividends then reinvest those dividends into the security you bought.

    "header": "Why diversify stocksinvestments?",
    "body": "Basically, diversifying narrows the spread of possible results, raising the center of the returns bellcurve by reducing the likelihood of extreme results at either the high or low end. Its largely a matter of basic statistics. Bet doubleornothing on a single coin flip, and those are the only possible results, and your odds of a disaster losing most or all of the money are 50. Bet half of it on each of two coin flips, and your odds of losing are reduced to 25 at the cost of reducing your odds of winning to 25, with 50 odds that you retain your money and can try the game again. Three coins divides the space further the extremes are reduced to 12.5 each, with the middle being most likely. If that was all there was, this would be a zerosum game and pure gambling. But the stock market is actually positivesum, since companies are delivering part of their profits to their stockholder owners. This moves the center of the bell curve up a bit from breakeven, historically to about 8. This is why index funds produce a profit with very little active decision they treat the variation as mostly random which seems to work statistically and just try to capture average results of a hopefully slightly aboveaverage bucket of stocks andor bonds. This approach is boring. It will never double your money overnight. On the other hand, it will never wipe you out overnight. If you have patience and are willing to let compound interest work for you, and trust that most market swings regress to the mean in the long run, it quietly builds your savings while not driving you crazy worrying about it. If all you are looking for is better return than the banks, and you have a reasonable amount of time before you need to pull the funds out, its one of the more reliably predictable riskreward tradeoff points. You may want to refine this by biasing the mix of what youre holding. The simplest adjustment is how much you keep in each of several major investment categories. Large cap stocks, small cap stocks, bonds, and real estate in the form of REITs each have different baseline riskreturn curves, and move in different ways in response to news, so maintaining a selected ratio between these buckets and adding the resulting curves together is one simple way to make fairly predictable adjustments to the width and centerline of the total bell curve. If you think you can do better than this, go for it. But index funds have been outperforming professionally managed funds after the management fees are accounted for, and unless you are interested in spending a lot of time researching and playing with your money the odds of your doing much better arent great unless youre willing to risk doing much worse. For me, boring is good. I want my savings to work for me rather than the other way around, and I dont consider the market at all interesting as a game. Others will feel differently."

    "header": "Buying from an aggressive salesperson",
    "body": "From your question and how you have framed it, I get you find Agressive Sales tactics disturb the buying process for you.  I understand because I also find the whole process of Research  Negotiating  Buying  Owning  Using is all on one continuum, so anything that ruins the process will likely lose the sale or enjoyment of the item, at the end of the day. [Very long answer .... Sorry  ] The answer to this is to KNOW what you want before you have to deal with the Sales people. A good Sales person likes a customer who knows what they want. I would suggest that you follow my Buying Process Much you have already done  Before you Buy Identify the item you want and the maxmin realistic price you would buy at. [Stick to this price else Buyers Remorse may bite later.] Write the questions you have down on paper before you visit the Dealer. Write the answers you want on the same list, if known. Decide which questions are most important and therefore must get the answer you want. These should be the questions you ask first. Mark these on the list. Revisit points 13 are they complete and to your satisfaction ? Would you buy if all the answers  the price are right ? If NO then revisit point 13 else you are not ready to buy now !!! If YES then Organise your visit to the Dealer. [Book appointment etc if needed.] At Dealer Meet your Sales person and clearly state what you want the item and importantly when you intend to buy, if all your questions are answered to your satisfaction. There is no need to discuss price at this point as the haggling is only possible IF the questions are answered to your satisfaction. Do not give information such as your maximum budget or similar requests, as they give the sales person the upper hand to maximise hisher pricing. If asked state that your budget is conditional on the answers you get. As the questions are answered assess the answer and assign  to the question on your list. If any of your most critical  important questions are answered in the negative, they are the reasons you have to call it a day and walk out. You can assess whether they are worth ignoring but you will need to factor this into your price and if you have identified your questions correctly there should be little room for debate. Assuming you have got all your questions answered you should know what you are buying and have assessed what is a reasonable price for it, if you still want it as this point. If you have lost interest, say so and let the Sales person go. Dont waste their time. They may make some sort of offer to you BUT dont forget that if you have doubts now they will not go away easily no matter what the great price is. If you want it then continue. Buying your Item [None of the following is really usefull if you have told the Sales person your Budget, as they will be aiming for the highest end of your budget. You will often find that the best price is very close to your maximum budget !!! ] Do not forget your realistic price range, this should limit your buying price no matter what tactics are used by the Sales person. Only you know what you are prepared to pay and if an extra 1 or 50 is considered worth it to you, if you have to have the item  Regardless, you have to have some idea of your limit and be prepared to stick to it. You must be able to walk away if the price is silly and not worth it. Assuming you have not been smitten by your item and funds are NOT unlimited, ask for the price and assess it against your price range. At this point I can only offer pointers as there are no magic rules to get what you want at the lowest price. The only advice I would offer is that you will be lucky to get something at your 1st offer price unless the seller really needs to sell, because of this your 1st offer should be less than your price range lowest band. You will need to assess how much less but be prepared to get a No response. If you get a Yes and your research is good Buy It !!! If you get too enthusiastic a response, question your research  if not sure bail out [No Sale]  At this point you are likely to be Haggling so you need to be ready for all the Must buy Now tactics. If you have clearly stated your wants and timescales there is no reason to be pulled in by these tactics and they can be ignored until the price has reached the level you are happy with. If the price is not moving where you want than clearly state you cannot buy at that price. If you get a total stop and no movement than you need to assess your need and if priced too high then you should walk out. Remember if you stated that you had a timescale to buy of 123 weeks you should act like you have 123 weeks to keep looking. Any eagerness on your part will tell the Sales person that you have lied !!!  You can always come back and try again, reminding the Sales person that the item is still there and perhaps it is priced too high to sell and make the same offer. !!! A bit of cheek sometimes works. If the price is close and you still want it and the Sales person is not moving you need to try walking out while stating that you would love the item if it was priced better, if no improved offer as you go, try an increased offer but again you need to assess how much and remember you can only go up, or walk out and come back another day. If the price is at a level you are happy with then you should have no reason not to buy if you have followed this process but this does not mean that you should be forced into buying now if you do not want to. Regardless of any Must buy now tactics if the price is right and you cannot buy now, tell the Sales person when you CAN buy and see if you can get an agreement with this. It is unfair to expect a price to be held for an indeterminate time, so you do need to state when you could buy if not now when a price has been agreed. This is a point where the deal may break down if the Sales person thinks they have a sale and trys to force the Sale now. Once again you have to assess your need and whether buying now is better than walking out. If the deal breaks down there is nothing stopping you from coming back and offering the same price when you can buy. A final option is to agree if a deposit can be left to reserve the item until you can buy. This gives the Sales person some assurance that you will come back and is sometimes NONRefundable unless you agree otherwise before you pay, so check this detail first. This tends to be smaller Dealers but generally in the UK the large companies offer refundable deposits as part of their Customer Service, the advantage of using larger StoresDealers etc. Apologies for the epic reply, hope it helps."

    "header": "Buying a house, Bank or rent to own?",
    "body": "It depends on the deal and you didnt give any details. That said, there are some things that stand out regardless, and some more specific answers to your questions. First, Mortgage rates at the bank are absurdly low right now. Like 45 less than 4 for excellent credit. You say your credit is ok, so unless your landlord is willing to do a deal where they get no benefit beyond the price of the house, the bank is the way to go. If you dont have much for a down payment, go with an FHA loan, where you need only 3.5 down. Second, there is another option in between bank mortgage and renttoown. And that is that where your landlord \"carries the note\". Basically, there is a mortgage, and it works like a bank mortgage, but instead of the bank owning the mortgage, your landlord does. Now, in terms of them carrying all of it, this isnt really helpful. Who wants to make 34 interest? But, there is an interesting opportunity here. With your ok credit, you can probably get pretty close to 4 interest at the bank IF the loan is for 80 LTV loan to value that is, 20 equity. At 80 LTV you also wont have PMI, so between the two that loan will be very cheap. Then, your accommodating landlord can \"carry\" the rest at, say, 67 interest, junior to the bank mortgage meaning if you default, the bank gets first dibs on the value of the house. Under that scenario, your over all interest payment is very reasonable, and you wouldnt have to put any money down. Now for your other questions If we rent to own are we building equity? Not usually. Like the other posters said, renttoown is whatever both parties agree on. But objectively, most renttoown agreements, whether for a TV or a house, are set up to screw the buyer. Sorry to be blunt, and Im not saying your landlord would do that, this is just generally how it is with rent to own. You dont own it till you make the last payment, and if you miss a payment they repo the property. There is no recourse because, hey, it was a rental agreement! Of course the agreements vary, and people who offer rent to own arent necessarily bad people, but its like one of those payday loan places They provide a valid service but no one with other options uses them. If we rent to own, can we escape if we have to read cant pay anymore. Usually, sure! Think about what youre saying \"Heres the house back, and all that money I paid you? Keep it!\" Its a great deal if youre on the selling side. How does rent to own affect or not our credit? It all depends on how its structured. But really, it comes down to are they going to do reporting to the credit bureaus? In a renttoown agreement between individuals, the answer is no. individuals cant report to a credit bureau. its kind of a big deal to be set up to be able to do that"

In other words, it may be that in India a research assistant at a college on average earns a third of what a research assistant like me earns here in US. In that case, even if my cost of living there is much less, so is my salary. There are sites that provide a good guidance for what the average salary for an profession with x years of experience would be. Of course some would get paid more than average. So you can try and make a logic, if in US say you are being paid more than average, you would be paid more than average elsewhere. Plus If moving from Developed to Developing country, one has the Advantage of positive pedigree bias. There are also websites that would give the Purchasing Power Parity for quite a few currency pairs. The Real difficulty to find is whether the Lifestyle you have in a specific country would be similar in other country. If you compare like for like it becomes slightly skewed. If you compare equivalence, then can you adjust. A relevant example my friend in US had a Independent Bungalow in US. It was with Basement and attic, 2 levels of living space with 4 bedroom. He shifted to India and got a great salary compared to normal Indian salary. However this kind of house in India in Bangalore would be affordable only to CEOs of top companies. So is living in a 3 room apartment fine? There are multiple such aspects. Drinking a Starbucks coffee couple of times a day is routine for quite a few in US. In India this would be considered luxury. A like for equivalent comparison is \"One drinks 34 mugs of Coffee\" in US, and average Indian drinks \"TeaCoffee 34 mugs\". In India the local Tea  Coffee would be Rs 10  Rs 20. A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150. The same applies to food. A McBurger in India would be around Rs 100. The Indian equivalent Wada Pav is for Rs 10. A Sub Way would be Rs 150. A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around Rs 25. I personally am picky about food, so it doesnt matter where I go, I can only eat specific things, which means I spend a huge amount of money if I am outside of India. When I was in US, I couldnt afford a maid, driver or any help. In India I have 2 maids, a cooking maid and a driver. Plus I get plumber, electrician, window cleaner, and all the help without costing me much. Things that I absolutely cant dream in US. My colleague in UK preferred to stay in a specific locality as it has a very good Church. So if its important, one may find few good ones in India if one is Roman Catholic, if one follows Lutheran, Greek Orthodox, tough luck. Citizenship Does it matter ... A foreign national may never get an Indian citizenship. Children dont qualify either unless both parents are Indian. Health Care Again is quite different. One may feel Health care in US is not good or very expensive ... but there are multiple aspects of this. So in essence its very broad there is traffic, cleanliness, climate, culture, etc ... PS A research assistant in India is poorly paid, because colleges dont have funds. Research in fundamental science is quite low.

You can look this term up online for more details. Cash and bonds are low risk. If you have absolutely no lowrisk assets, then in the event of, say, a market crash, you may have no savings to fall back on.

    "body": "When you sell the stock your income is from the difference of prices between when you bought the stock and when you sold it. Theres no interest there. The interest is in two places the underlying company assets which you own, whether you want it or not, and in the distribution of the income to the owners the dividends. You can calculate which portion of the interest income constitutes your dividend by allocating the portions of your dividend in the proportions of the company income. That would very roughly and unreliably, of course give you an estimate what portion of your dividend income derives from the interest. Underlying assets include all the profits of the company that havent been distributed through dividends, but rather reinvested back into the business. These may or may not be reflected in the market price of the company. Bottom line is that theres no direct correlation between the income from the sale of the stake of ownership and the company income from interest, if any correlation at all exists. Why would you care about interest income of Salesforce? Its not a bank or a lender, they may have some interest income, but thats definitely not the main income source of the company. If you want to know how much interest income exactly the company had, youll have to dig deep inside the quarterly and annual reports, and even then Im not sure if youll find it as a separate item for a company thats not in the lending business."

    "body": "Anthony Russell  I agree with JohnFx. Petroleum is used in making many things such as asphalt, road oil, plastic, jet fuel, etc. Its also used in some forms of electricity generation, and some electric cars use gasoline as a backup form of energy, petrol is also used in electricity generation outside of cars. Source can be found here. But to answer your question of why shares of electric car companies are not always negatively related to one another deals with supply and demand. If investors feel positively about petroleum and petroleum related prospects, then they are going to buy or attempt to buy shares of \"X\" petrol company. This will cause the price of \"X\", petrol company to rise, ceteris paribus. Just because the price of petroleum is high doesnt mean investors are going to buy shares of an electric car company. Petrol prices could be high, but numerous electric car companies could be doing poorly, now, with that being said you could argue that sales of electric cars may go up when petrol prices are high, but there are numerous factors that come into play here. I think it would be a good idea to do some more research if you are planning on investing. Also, remember, after a company goes public they no longer set the price of the shares of their stock. The price of company \"X\" shares are determined by supply and demand, which is inherently determined by investors attitudes and expectations, ultimately defined by past company performance, expectations of future performance, earnings, etc.. It could be that when the market is doing well  its a good sign of other macroeconomic variables employment, GDP, incomes, etc and all these factors power how often individuals travel, vacation, etc. It also has to deal with the economy of the country producing the oil, when you have OPEC countries selling petrol to the U.S. it is likely much cheaper per barrel than domestic produced and refined petrol because of the labor laws, etc. So a strong economy may be somewhat correlated with oil prices and a strong market, but its not necessarily the case that strong oil prices drive the economy..I think this is a great research topic that cannot be answered in one post.. Check this article here. From here you can track down what research the Fed of Cleveland has done concerning this. My advice to you is to not believe everything your peers tell you, but to research everything your peers tell you.

The first leg of the strategy, corresponding to B, is the sale of a call option at a strike price of B in this case 165. The proceeds from this sale, after transaction costs, are generally used to offset the cost of the second leg. The second leg of the strategy, corresponding to A, is the purchase of a call option at a strike price of A in this case 145. Now, the important part the payoff. You can visualize it as so. This is where it gets a teeny bit mathy. Below, P is the profit of the strategy, K1 is the strike price of the long call, K2 is the strike price of the short call, T1 is the premium paid for the long call option at the time of purchase, T2 is the premium received for the short call at the time of sale, and S is the current price of the stock. For simplicitys sake, we will assume that your position quantity is a single option contract and transaction costs are zero which they are not. P  T2  max0, S  K2  max0, S  K1  T1 Concretely, lets plug in the strikes of the strategy Nathan proposes, and current prices which I pulled from the screen. You have P  1.85  max0, 142.50  165  max0, 142.50  145  7.80 If the stock goes to 150, the payoff is 2.80, which isnt quite break even  but it may have been at the time he was speaking on TV.

Various actions you can take e.g., charitable donations, IRA contributions, selling stocks may increase or reduce your tax liability. One tool Ive found useful for estimating federal taxes is the Excel 1040 spreadsheet. This is a spreadsheet version of the income tax return form. It is not official and is not created by the IRS, but is maintained as a labor of love by a private individual. In practice, however, it is pretty much an accurate implementation of the tax calculation algorithms encoded in the tax forms and instructions. The nice thing about it is that its a spreadsheet. You can plug numbers into various slots in the spreadsheet and see how they affect your federal tax liability. You may also owe state taxes depending on what state you live in. Of course, the estimates you get by doing this are only at most as accurate as your estimates of the various numbers you plug in. Still, I think its a free and useful way to get a ballpark estimate of your tax liability based on numbers that you can more easily estimate e.g., how much money you expect to earn."

Financial markets are amongst the most complex systems we know of. To borrow a concept from mathematics  that of a chaotic system  one might say that financial markets are a chaotic system comprised of a nested structure of chaotic subsystems. For example, the unpredictable behaviour of a single big market participant can have dramatic effects on overall market behaviour. In my experience, becoming a successful investor requires a considerable amount of time and commitment and has a steep learning curve. Your actions in abandoning your graduate studies hint that you are perhaps lacking in commitment. Most people believe that they are special and that investing will be easy money. If you are currently entertaining such thoughts, then you would be well advised to forget them immediately and prepare to show some humility. TLDR It is currently considered that behavioural psychology is a valuable tool in understanding investors behaviour as well as overall market trends. Also in the area of psychology, confirmation bias is another aspect of trading that it is important to keep in mind. Quantitative analysis is a mathematical tool that is currently used by hedge funds and the big investment banks, however these methods require considerable resources and given the performance of hedge funds in the last few years, it does not appear to be worth the investment. If you are serious in wanting to make the necessary commitments, then here are a few ideas on where to start  There are certain technical details that you will need to understand in order to quantify the risks you are taking beyond simple buying and holding financial instruments. For example, how option strategies can be used limit your risk how margin requirements may force your hand in volatile markets how different markets impact on one another  e.g., the relationship between bond markets and equity markets and a host of other issues. Also, to repeat, it is important to understand how your own psychology can impact on your investment decisions."

Lenders seem to like to see at least one instance where you charged a large balance, held it a couple months, then paid it off in full... but I wouldnt go out of my way to do that. Remember that the credit card company is making money on transaction fees as well as interest. If youre pushing money through their system, theyre happy. Theyd be happier if you were paying them interest too  reportedly, they actually refer to those of us who pay in full every month as \"deadbeats\"  but they arent going to kick you out or ding your credit rating for it. The quote you give says that a small balance \"may be slightly better\". I submit that \"may be slightly\" is too small a difference to be worth worrying about, unless you have reason to believe that your credit rating actively needs to be repaired. And as noted in the comments, its actually stated even less strongly than that! Personal recommendation You can get a free credit report each year from each of the \"big three\" credit rating agencies. Those reports usually include a brief explanation of what they think the most negative item on your record is. The phrasing of those explanations is often somewhat misleading, but Id still suggest that you get these reports and see what they think would improve your rating.

The delta between those regarding benefits goes way beyond health care. In fact because almost every full time employee must have health care offered by their employer the option of \"you can have X with healthcare, or Y with no healthcare\" is no longer an option. I have seen situations in the last few years where employees who had no need for healthcare coverage retired military were offered additional vacation days to compensate for their lower cost to the employer. For employee vs contractor what is different isnt just healthcare. It also includes holidays, vacation days, sick days, employer portion of social security, education benefits, and 401k. Insurance benefits include not just healthcare but also dental, vision, short term and long term disability, and life insurance. The rule of thumb to cover all these benefits that are lost when you are a contractor is an amount equal to your income. Of course some of these benefits depend on single vs married and kids or not. But unless the rate they are paying the contractors is approaching twice the rate they are paying employees the contractor will be hard pressed to cover the missing benefits."

So while you can identify them at any time scale although as a rule the time scale on which you observed them should be similar to the time scale on which you intend to use them, its no matter unless thats what all the other traders are thinking as well. Especially if there are multiple possible SP levels for different time scales, there will be no consensus, and the whole system will break down as one cohort ruins the other groups SP by not playing along and vice versa. But often fundamentals are expected to dominate in the long run, so if you are thinking of trades longer than a year, support and resistance will likely become meaningless regardless.

Typically, the continuouslycompounded models represent the ideal as the compounding period of timevalued money shrinks towards zero, and the discount rate or interest rate if positive stays constant over the time period examined, the periodic equations results approach that of the continuouslycompounded equation. Those two assumptions a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest that allow simplification to the continuous form are usually incorrect in realworld finance virtually all financial institutions accrue interest monthly, for a variety of reasons including simpler bookkeeping and less money paid or owed in interest. They also, unless prohibited by contract, accrue this interest based on a rate that can change daily or even more granularly based on what financial markets are doing. Most often, the calculation is periodic based on the \"average daily balance\" and an agreed rate that, if variable, is based on the \"average daily rate\" over the previous observed period. So, you should use the first form for fast calculation of a rough value based on estimated variables. You should use the second form when you have accurate periodic information on the variables involved. Stated alternately, use the first form to predict the future, use the second form in retrospect to the past."

Those products are more expensive because the commission comes out of your end. Not to mention any names. E.J. If you want financial advice that is honest, find a financial advisor who you pay for his advice, and who doesnt sell products at all. Or, just ask here. But I would start by listening to Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey, whomever you prefer. And read John Bogles book. They can tell you all about the difference between money market, bonds, stocks, managed mutual funds ripoff! and index funds. IRA accounts, Roth IRA accounts and taxable accounts are all brokerage accounts. Within them, you can buy any security you want, including index funds. The difference is taxation. Suppose you earn 1000 and choose to invest it however Later you withdraw it and it has grown to 3000. Investing in a taxable account, you pay normal income tax on the 1000. When you later withdraw the 3000, you pay a tax on 2000 of income. If you invested more than a year, it is taxed at a much lower \"capital gains\" tax rate. With a traditional IRA account, you pay zero taxes on the initial 1000. Later, when you take the money out, you pay normal income tax on the full 3000. If you withdrew it before age 5912, you also pay a 10 penalty 300. With a Roth IRA account, you pay normal income tax on the 1000. When you withdraw the 3000 later, you pay NOTHING in taxes. Provided you followed the rules. You can invest in almost anything inside these accounts Money market funds. Terrible return. You wont keep up with the market. Bonds. Low return but usually quite safe. Individual stocks. Good luck. Managed mutual funds. Youre paying some genius stock picker to select high performing stocks. He has a huge staff of researchers and good social connections. He also charges you 1.5 per year overhead as an \"expense ratio\", which is a total loss to you. The fact is, he can usually pick stocks better than a monkey throwing darts. But hes not 1.5 better! Index funds. These just shrug and buy every stock on the market. Theres no huge staff or genius manager, just some intern making small adjustments every week. As such, the expense ratio is extremely small, like 0.1. If any of these investments pay dividends, you must pay taxes on them when theyre issued, if youre not in an IRA account. This problem gets fixed in ETFs. Index ETFs. These are index funds packaged to behave like stocks. Dividends increase your stocks value instead of being paid out to you, which simplifies your taxes. If you buy index funds outside of an IRA, use these. Too many other options to get into here."

    "body": "If you sell a stock you dont own, its called a short sale. You borrowed the shares from an owner of the stock and eventually would buy to close. On most normal shares, you can hold a short position indefinitely, but there are some shares that have a combination of either a small float or too high a short position that shares to short are not available. This can create a \"short squeeze\" where shorts are burned by being forced to buy the stock back. Last  when you did this, you should have instructed the broker that you were \"selling to open\" or \"selling short.\" In the old days, when people held stock certificates, you were required to send the certificate in when you sold. Today, the broker should know that wasnt your intention."

A lot of money is lost dealing with .05 increments. Issues are added to the penny pilot program based on existing liquidity in both the stock and the options market, but the utility of the penny pilot program outweighs the discretionary liquidity judgement that the CBOE makes to list issues in that program. The reason the CBOE doesnt list all stocks in the penny pilot program is because they believe that their data vendors cannot handle all of the market data.

    "body": "Your are mixing multiple questions with assertions which may or may not be true. So Ill take a stab at this, comment if it doesnt make sense to you. To answer the question in the title, you invest in an IRA because you want to save money to allow you to retire. The government provides you with tax incentives that make an IRA an excellent vehicle to do this. The rules regarding IRA tax treatment provide disincentives, through tax penalties, for withdrawing money before retirement. This topic is covered dozens of times, so search around for more detail. Regarding your desire to invest in items with high \"intrinsic\" value, I would argue that gold and silver are not good vehicles for doing this. Intrinsic value doesnt mean what you want it to mean in this context  gold and silver are commodities, whose prices fluctuate dramatically. If you want to grow money for retirement over a long period, of time, you should be invested in diversified collection of investments, and precious metals should be a relatively small part of your portfolio."

Subject to daily withdrawal limits imposed by your bank, a considerable amount of money could be lost in this way. At least in the US, debit or ATM cards, although they are often branded Mastercard or Visa, do not provide the same level of protection as credit cards for which the liability is limited to 50 until the card is reported as lost or stolen and 0 thereafter. Note also that the money in your savings account is safe, unless you have chosen an automatic overdraft protection feature that automatically transfers money from your savings account into the checking account to cover overdrafts. So that is another reason to keep most of your money in the savings account and only enough for immediately foreseeable needs in the checking account and to think carefully before accepting automatic overdraft protection offers. These days, with mobile banking available via smartphones and the like, transferring money yourself from savings to checking account as needed might be a preferred way of doing things on the go until the smartphone is stolen!"

    "body": "In general, investors with a long period of time until they would need to withdraw the cash are best off holding mostly equities. While the dividends that equities would return are less than the interest you would get in peertopeer lending, over long periods of time not only do you get the dividends from equity investment but the value of the stock will grow faster than interest on loans. The higher returns from stocks, however, comes with more risk of big downturns. Many people pull their investments out of stocks right after crashes which really hurts their long term returns. So, in order to get the benefit of investing in stocks you need to be strong enough to continue to hold the stocks through the crash and into the recovery. As for which stocks to invest in, generally it is best to invest in lowfee index fundsetfs where you own a broad collection of stocks so that if when any one stock goes bust that your portfolio does not take much damage. Try to own both international and domestic stocks to get good diversification. The consensus recommends adding just a little bit of REITs and bonds to your investments, but for someone at 25 it might not be worth it yet.

    "body": "Cashless health insurance offers a convenient and hasslefree way to manage medical expenses during hospitalization. Heres how it works Step 1 Choose a Cashless Plan Opt for a health insurance plan offering cashless hospitalization facilities. Most insurers today provide this option. Step 2 Network Hospital Selection Choose a hospital within your insurers network. Network hospitals have agreements with the insurance company for cashless claim settlements. Step 3 Informing the Insurance Company Notify your insurance company or TPA Third Party Administrator about your hospitalization at a network hospital. This can be done online, through a mobile app, or by calling their helpline. Step 4 Preauthorization The insurance company will verify your policy details and the medical condition requiring hospitalization. They may also require additional documents like medical reports. Based on the verification, they will issue a preauthorization letter confirming coverage for the estimated treatment cost. Step 5 Cashless Treatment Submit the preauthorization letter to the hospital administration. The hospital will directly bill the insurance company for the covered expenses as per the plan and preauthorization limit. You only pay any noncovered expenses or amounts exceeding the preauthorized limit directly to the hospital. Step 6 Claim Settlement The hospital submits the final bills and medical records to the insurance company for claim settlement. Upon verification, the insurance company settles the claim directly with the hospital. Benefits of Cashless Health Insurance Reduced financial stress Avoid upfront payments during hospitalization, especially in emergencies. Convenience No need to worry about claim forms or reimbursement processes. Transparency Clear understanding of covered expenses beforehand through preauthorization. Faster treatment Hospitals prioritize cashless patients, potentially leading to quicker admission and treatment. Remember Not all medical procedures might be covered under cashless hospitalization. Read your policy document carefully to understand exclusions and limitations. Maintain clear communication with your insurance company and the hospital throughout the process."

Now, the important value here, is the last column Volume. According to Wikipedia, the trading on Frankfort Stock Exchange is done today exclusively via Xetra platform, thus the volume on ETRDAI is much more important than on FRADAI. Obviously, they Wikipedia is not 100 accurate, i.e. not all trading is done electronically via Xetra. According to their webpage, Frankfort exchange has a Specialist Trading on Frankfurt Floor service which has slightly different trading hours. I suspect what Google and Yahoo show as Frankfort exchange is this manual trading via a Specialist opposed to Xetra electronic trading. To answer your question, the stock youre having is exactly the same, meaning if you bought an ETRBMW you can still sell it on FRA by calling a FRA Trading Floor Specialist which will probably cost you a fee. On the other hand, for the portfolio valuation and performance assessments you should only use ETRBMW prices, because it is way more liquid, and thus better reflect the current market valuation."

    "header": "If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?",
    "body": "If so, then if company A never pays dividends to its shareholders, then what is the point of owning company As stock? The stock itself can go up in price. This is not necessarily pure speculation either, the company could just reinvest the profits and grow. Since you own part of a company, your share would also increase in value. The company could also decide to start paying dividend. I think one rule of thumb is that growing companies wont pay out, since they reinvest all profit to grow even more, but very large companies like McDonalds or Microsoft who dont really have much room left to grow will pay dividends more. Surely the right to one vote for company As Board cant be that valuable. Actually, Google for instance neither pays dividend nor do you get to vote. Basically all you get for your money is partial ownership of the company. This still gives you the right to seize Google assets if you go bankrupt, if theres any asset left once the creditors are done credit gets priority over equity. What is it that Im missing? What you are missing is that the entire concept of the dividend is an illusion. Theres little qualitative difference between a stock that pays dividend, and a stock that doesnt. If you were going to buy the stock, then hold it forever and collect dividend, you could get the same thing with a dividendless stock by simply waiting for it to gain say 5 value, then sell 4.76 of your stock and call the cash your dividend. \"But wait,\" you say, \"thats not the same  my net worth has decreased!\" Guess what, stocks that do pay dividend usually do drop in value right after the pay out, and they drop by about the relative value of the dividend as well. Likewise, you could take a stock that does pay dividend, and make it look exactly like a nonpaying stock by simply taking every dividend you get and buying more of the same stock with it. So from this simplistic point of view, it is irrelevant whether the stock itself pays dividend or not. There is always the same decision of whether to cut the goose or let it lay a few more eggs that every shareholder has to make it. Paying a dividend is essentially providing a different default choice, but makes little difference with regards to your choices. There is however more to it than simple return on investment arithmetic As I said, the alternative to paying dividend is reinvesting profits back into the enterprise. If the company decided to pay out dividend, that means they think all the best investing is done, and they dont really have a particularly good idea for what to do with the extra money. Conversely, not paying is like management telling the shareholders, \"no were not done, were still building our business!\". So it can be a way of judging whether the company is concentrating on generating profit or growing itself. Needless to say the, the market is wild and unpredictable and not everyone obeys such assumptions. Furthermore, as I said, you can effectively overrule the decision by increasing or decreasing your position, regardless of whether they have decided to pay dividend to begin with. Lastly, there may be some subtle differences with regards to things like how the income is taxed and so on. These dont really have much to do with the market itself, but the bureaucracy tacked onto the market."

For larger transfers 10k and up the exchange rate is the dominant factor, and you will get the best rates from Interactive Brokers IB as noted by Paul above, or OANDA listed by user6714. Under 10k, CurrencyFair is probably your best bet while the rates are not quite as good as IB or OANDA, they are much better than the banks, and the transaction fees are less. If you dont need to exchange the currency immediately, you can put in your own bids and potentially get better rates from other CurrencyFair users. Below 1000, XE Trade also listed by user6714 has exchange rates that are almost as good, but also offers EFT transfers in and out, which will save you wire transfer fees from your bank to send or receive money tofrom your currency broker. The bank wire transfer fees in the US can be 1030 outgoing wires on the higher end so for smaller transfers this is a significant consideration you need to look into if you are receiving money in US, ING Direct and many brokerage accounts dont charge for incoming wires  but unless you have a commercial bank account with high balances, expect to spend 1020 minimum for outgoing. European wire transfer fees are minimal or zero in most cases, making CurrencyFair more appealing if the money stays in Europe.

    "body": "I dont have a formula for anything like this, but it is important to note that the \"current value\" of any asset is really theoretical until you actually sell it. For example, lets consider a house. You can get an appraisal done on your house, where your home is inspected, and the sales of similar houses in your area are compared. However, this value is only theoretical. If you found yourself in a situation where you absolutely had to sell your house in one week, you would most likely have to settle for much less than the appraised value. The same hold true for collectibles. If I have something rare that I need cash for immediately, I can take it to a pawn shop and get cash. However, if I take my time and locate a genuinely interested collector, I can get more for it. This is comparable to someone who holds a significant percentage of shares in a publicly held corporation. If the current market value of your shares is 10 million, but you absolutely need to sell your entire stake today, you arent going to get 10 million.

If you do your taxes yourself, you may be more likely to do a more thorough job in digging everything up. You might even find that you can deduct some things that you hadnt thought of before. On the other hand, whenever Ive gone to a tax professional, its always been pretty much an allornothing proposal. You sit down with them and hand them your records, they ask a couple simple questions, and they either give you your completed tax return onthespot or they have you come back in a week for a brief review of the final numbers. If they dont prepare your return onthespot, you can usually send additional items later on if you think of something that you forgot the first time around, but for the most part its still a onetime shot. That said, Im beginning to think the difference in monetary cost of completing even a mildly complex tax return is going to be insignificant, and the main factors to consider are the value of your own time and how much of the tax code you want to learn because, in my experience, the software always refers to additional IRS forms or codes that are not automated in the software. In theory, your tax return should be the same regardless of whether you have a tax professional do your taxes or, if you do them yourself, which software you use. Given the same inputs, you should get about the same outputs. Even though that theory doesnt always hold exactly true, all the options should get you in the same ballparkclose enough that it doesnt make much difference in the grand scheme of things, unless your tax return is done incorrectly e.g., you choose the wrong filing status or forget to take a major deduction. Suppose youre married and you or your spouse is a partner in an LLC. Maybe a tax professional wants to charge you 500 for your tax return this will vary based on your circumstances. You could alternatively buy the tax software for 40300 and spend 20 hours navigating through the interviews and reviewing tax codes for the decisions and worksheets that are not automated in the software. Depending on how much time you personally have to spend on the tax return, one option might be better than the other. Maybe you have to pay your inhouse accounting person to use the tax software, or you have to pay an employee to cover for you while you use the software. Keep in mind that the tax professional and the tax software are probably deductible, whereas your time may not be.

    "body": "First, if you live inaround a reasonably populated urban area, and youre in the United States, I cant see why you would choose to bank with Chase, B of A, or another large commercial bank. I think you would be much better served by banking at a reasonably large credit union. There are many differences between banks and credit unions, but in a nutshell, credit unions are owned by the members, and operate primarily to provide benefits to their members, whereas a bank is owned by the shareholders, and operates primarily to make profits for the shareholders not to benefit the customers. The banking industry absolutely hates the credit unions, so if youve ever been nickeledanddimed with this fee and that charge by your bank, I have to ask why youre still banking with a company that irritates you andor actively tries to screw you out of your money? I live in California, and Ive banked at credit unions almost exclusively since I started working nearly 30 years ago. Every time Ive strayed and started banking at a forprofit bank, Ive regretted it. For example, a few years ago I opened a checking account at a nowdefunct bank WaMu just for online use eBay and so forth. It was a free checking account. When Chase bought WaMu, the account became a Chase account, and it seemed that every other statement brought new fees, new restrictions, and so forth. I finally closed it when they imposed some stupid fee for not carrying enough of a balance. I found out by logging in to their Web site and seeing a balance of zero dollars they had imposed the fee a few statements back, and I had missed it, so they kept debiting my account until it was empty. At this point, I do about 90 of my banking at a fairly large credit union. I have a mortgage with a big bank, but that was out of my hands, as the lenderoriginator sold the mortgage and I had no say in the matter. My credit union has a highly functional Web site, permits me to download my account activity to Quicken, and even has mobile apps which allow me to deposit a check by taking a picture of it, or check my account activity, etc. They my credit union are part of a network of other credit unions, so as long as I am using a network ATM, I never pay a fee. In sum, I cant see any reason to go with a bank. Regarding checks, I write a small number of checks per year, but I recently needed to reorder them. My credit union refers members directly to HarlandClarke, a majorleague player in the check printing business. Four boxes of security checks was around 130 plus shipping, which is not small money. However, I was able to order the very same checks via Costco for less than half that amount. Costco refers members to a check printing service, which is a frontsubsidiary of HarlandClarke, and using a promo code, plus the discount given for my Costco membership, I got four boxes of security checks shipped to me for less than 54. My advice would be to look around. If youre a Costco member, use their check printing service. Walmart offers a similar service to anyone, as does Sams Club, and you can search around to find other similar services. Bottom line, if you order your checks via your bank or credit union, chances are you will pay full retail. Shop around, and save a bit. Ive not opened a new account at a credit union in some time, but I would not be surprised if a credit union offered a free box of checks when you open a new account with them."

    "header": "Is it OK to use a credit card on zerointerest to pay some other credit cards with higherinterest?",
    "body": "The short answer is it depends. The longer answer is that balance transfers are tricky, and often a baitandswitch theyll offer 0 interest, but charge a 34 \"fee\" which isnt interest and is perfectly legal on the amount transferred. If you transfer 5000, you now owe the new card company 5,200. Now, that could be fine with you at an 1820 APR on your old card you may have been charged that much in just one or two months, and by capitalizing this fee up front you lock in 0 for a year. However, there are other possible machinations behind the scenes. For instance, you may incur retroactive interest on the full balance if not paid off in the year at 20 APR on 5000, thats an extra grand you will owe if theres even one dollar of the original transferred balance left in the account. Paying off the balance and thus avoiding these penalties has actually been made harder by the CARD Act, which required creditors to apply any payment made to the highestinterest portion of the balance first. As balance transfers are 0 they are the last on the list, so if you transfer a balance and then carry an additional balance you are setting yourself up for failure. You MUST have a zerodollar balance for one month sometime during the year in order to be sure the balance transfer is paid off and no penalties will be incurred. That can be hard, because 5 grand is a lot to pay off. To pay off a 5000 balance in 12 months requires payments of 417. Miss one and youll have to make it up over the remaining months. If you transferred a balance, you probably didnt have 420mo to pay to the card in the first place. In summary, balance transfers can work, but you have to understand all of the terms and conditions, and what will happen should you violate any of them. If you dont understand what youre getting into, you could very well end up worse than you started."

But the banks are under no obligation to increase the rate they pay. So you or rather they can loan money directly to the United States Government by buying Bills, Notes, or Bonds. To do this you set up an account with Treasury Direct. You print off a form available at the website and take the filled out form to the bank. At the bank their identity and citizenship will be verified and the bank will complete the form. The form is then mailed into Treasury Direct. There are at least two investments you can make at Treasury Direct that guarantee a rate of return better than the inflation rate. They are Iseries bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities TIPS. Personally, I prefer the Iseries bonds to TIPS. Here is a link to the Treasury Direct website for information on Iseries bonds. this link takes you to information on TIPS. Edit To the best of my understanding, the Federal Reserve has no ability to set the rate for notes and bonds. It is my understanding that they can only directly control the overnight rate. Which is the rate the banks get for parking their money with the Fed overnight. I believe that the rates for longer term instruments are set by the market and are not mandated by the Fed or anyone else in government.

You dont get paid the money  the Ibond grows in value till you sell it. You can open a discount brokerage account, and buy 1 or more shares of stock in a company you like. Discount brokerages generally have a minimum of 500 or so, but will waive that if you set the account up as an IRA. Scot Trade, for instance. An IRA, in case you didnt know, is a type of account thats tax free but you cant touch it till you turn 59 12. Its meant to help you save for retirement. Incidentally, watch out of \"small account\" fees that some brokerages might charge you. Generally theyre annual or monthly charges theyd charge you to cover their costs on your account  since theyre certainly not going to make it in commissions. That IRA at Scot Trade is nofee. Speaking of commissions, those will be a big chunk of that 100. Itll be like 710 to buy that stock  a pretty big bite. However, many of these discount brokerages also offer some mutual funds for no commission. Those mutual funds, in turn, have minimums too, but once again if your accounts an IRA many will waive the minimum or set it low  like 100."

    "body": "I wrote a brilliant guest post at Dont Mess With Taxes, titled Roth IRAs and Your Retirement Income. Note  this article now reflects 2012 rates. Just updated Simply put, its an ongoing question of whether your taxes will be higher now than at any point in the future. If you are in the 25 bracket now, it would take quite of bit of money for your withdrawals to put you in that bracket at retirement. In the case of the IRA, you have the opportunity to convert in any year between now and retirement if your rate that year drops for whatever reason. The simplest case is if you are now in the 25 bracket. I say go pretax, and track, year by year what your withdrawal would be if you retired today. At 15, but with a good chance for promotion to the 25 bracket, start with Roth flavor and then as you hit 25, use a combination. This approach would smooth your marginal rate to stay at 15. To give you a start to this puzzle, in 2012, a couple has a 11,900 standard deduction along with 2 exemptions of 3800 each. This means the first 19,500 in an IRA comes out tax free at retirement. If you believe in a 4 withdrawal rate, you need a retirement account containing 500K pretax to generate this much money. This tick up with inflation, 2 years ago, it was 18,700 and 467K respectively. This is why those who scream \"taxes will go up\" may be correct, but do you really believe the standard deduction and exemptions will go away? Edit  and as time passes, and I learn more, new info comes to my attention. The above thoughts not withstanding, theres an issue of taxation of Social Security benefits. This creates a The Phantom Tax Rate Zone which I recently wrote about. A single person with not really too high an income gets thrust into the 46 bracket. Not a typo, 46.25 to be exact."

You are not allowed to just pull money out of a property and write off the interest. From Deducting Mortgage Interest FAQs If you own rental property and borrow against it to buy a home, the interest does not qualify as mortgage interest because the loan is not secured by the home itself. Interest paid on that loan cant be deducted as a rental expense either, because the funds were not used for the rental property. The interest expense is actually considered personal interest, which is no longer deductible. This is not exactly your situation of course, but it illustrates the restriction that will apply to you. Elsewhere in the article, it references how, if used for a business, the interest deduction still will not apply to the rental, but to the business via schedule C. In your case, its worse, you can never deduct interest used to fund a tax free bond, or to invest in such a tax favored product. Putting the facts aside, I often use the line \"dont let the tax tail wag the investing dog.\" Borrowing in order to reduce taxes is rarely a wise move. If you look at the interest on the 90K vs 290K, youll see you are paying, in effect, 5.12 on the extra 200K, due the higher rate on the entire sum. Elsewhere on this board, there are members who would say that given the choice to invest or pay off a 4 mortgage, paying it off is guaranteed, and the wiser thing to do. I think theres a fine line and might not be so quick to pay that loan off, an aftertax 3 cost of borrowing is barely higher than inflation. But to borrow at over 5 to invest in an annuity product whose terms you didnt disclose, does seem right to me. Borrow to invest in the next property? Thats another story."

Corporate entities usually do not have preferential tax treatment for investments. In the US, LLC is a passthough entity unless explicitly chosen to be taxed as a corporation, and then the above scenario happens. Passthrough entities LLCs and partnerships dont pay taxes, but instead report the gains to the owners, which then pay taxes as if the transaction was their personal one. So if youre in the US  investing under LLC would have no effect whatsoever on your taxes, or adverse effect if you chose to treat it as a corporation.

On the other hand, you will be free from the opposite risk rising rents. Once youve purchased the house, and as long as youre living in it, you dont ever need to worry about a local economic boom and a bunch of people moving into town and making more money than you, pushing up rents.

Frankly, the mortgage holders primary concern is you make payments on time, and they likely wont bother with any inquiry. That being said, should a homeowner have a pattern of buying primary residences, and in less than 1 year converting that primary to a rental, and purchasing a new primary there will likely be a grounds for prosecution for mortgage fraud. In your specific situation, you cannot legally sign the owneroccupancy affidavit with the intention of not staying for 1 year. A solution would be to purchase the condo as a second home, or investment both of which you can still typically get 80 financing. A second home is tricky, I would ask your lender what their requirements are for 2nd home classification. Outside that, you could buy the condo as a primary, stay in it for a year, then convert. If you absolutely had to purchase the 2nd property before 1 year, you could buy it as a primary with a 2 month rent back once you reach 10 months. Should you need it earlier, just buy the 2nd house as an investment, then once you move in, refinance it as a primary.

    "body": "First to actually answer the question \"how long at these ratespayments?\" These is nothing magic or nefarious about what the bank is doing. They add accrued interest and take your payment off the new total. Id make higher payments to the 8.75 debt until its gone, 100mo extra and be done. The first debt, if you bump it to 50 will be paid in 147 months, at 75mo, 92 months. Everything you pay above the minimum goes right to the principal balance and gets you closer to paying it off. The debt snowball is not the ideal way to pay off your debt. Say I have one 24 credit card the bank was nice enough to give me a 20,000 line of credit on. I also have 20 cards each with 1000 in credit, all at 6. The snowball dictates that the smallest debt be paid first, so while I pay the minimum on the 24 card, the 6 cards get paid off one by one, but Im supposed to feel good about the process, as I reduce the number of cards every few months. The correct way to line up debt is to pay off the tax adjusted highest rate first, as an extra 100 to the 24 card saves you 2mo vs 50 centsmo for the 6 cards. I wrote an article discussing the Debt Snowball which links to a calculator where you can see the difference in methods. I note that if the difference from lowest to highest rate is small, the Snowball method will only cost you a small amount more. If, by coincidence, the balances are close, the difference will also be small. The above aside, its the rest of your situation that will tell you the right path for you. For example, a matched 401k deposit should take priority over most debt repayment. The 11,000 might be better conserved for a house downpayment as that 66mo is student loan and wont count as the housing debt, rather \"other debt\" and part of the higher ratio when qualifying for the mortgage. If you already have taken this into account, by all means, pay off the 8.75 debt asap, then start paying off the 3 faster. Keep in mind, this is likely the lowest rate debt one can have and once paid off, you cant withdraw it again. So its important to consider the big picture first. Are you depositing to a retirement account? Is it a 401k and are you getting any matching from the company?"

    "body": "Are you implying that Amazon is a better investment than GE because Amazons PE is 175 while GEs is only 27? Or that GE is a better investment than Apple because Apples PE is just 13. There are a lot of other ratios to consider than PE. I personally view high PE numbers as a red flag. One way to think of a PE ratio is the number of years its expected for the company to earn its market cap. Share price divided by annual earnings per share It will take Amazon 175 years to earn 353 billion. If I was going to buy a dry cleaners, I would not pay the owner 175 years of earnings to take control of it, Id never see my investment back. To your point. There is so much future growth seemingly built in to todays stock market that even when a company posts higher than expected earnings, the companys stock may take a hit because maybe future prospects are a little less bright than everyone thought yesterday. The point of fundamental analysis is that you want to look at a companys management style and financial strategies. How is it paying its debt? How is it accumulating the debt? How is its return on assets? How is the return on assets trending? This way when you look at a few companies in the same market segment you may have a better shot at picking the winner over time. The company that piles on new debt for every new project is likely to continue that path in to oblivion, regardless of the PE ratio. or some other equally less forward thinking management practice that you uncover in your fundamental analysis efforts. And Ill add... No amount of historical good decision making from a companys management can prepare for a total market downturn, or lack of investor confidence in general. The market is the market sometimes its up irrationally, sometimes its down irrationally."

    "body": "I assume I canwill need to file an 83b election, in order to avoid tax repercussions? What exactly will this save me from? 83b election is for restricted stock grants, not for stock purchases. For restricted stocks, you generally pay income tax when they vest. For startups the price difference between the time of the grant and the time of the vesting can be astronomical and by choosing 83b you effectively pay income tax on the value of the grant instead of the value of the vest. Then, you only pay capital gains tax on the difference between the sale price and the grant value when you sell. In your case youre exercising an option, i.e. youre buying a stock, so 83b is irrelevant. What you will pay though is the tax on the difference between the strike price and the stock FMV unless the stocks you end up buying are restricted  which would have been the case if you exercised your options early, but I dont think is going to be the case now. What steps should I take to in the eyes of the law guarantee that the board has received my execution notice? The secretary of the board is a notorious procrastinator and can be very unorganized.

The other difference is that since many countries have regulations on who can buy common shares, for example in India an Non Resident cannot directly buy any share, hence he would buy ADR. Thus ADR would be priced more in the respective market if there is demand. For example Infosys Technologies, an India Company has ADR on NYSE. This is more expensive around 1.5 times the price of the common share available in India at current exchange rate.

    "body": "Im not entirely sure about some of the details in your question, since I think you meant to use 10,000 as the value of the futures contract and 3 as the value of the underlying stock. Those numbers would make more sense. That being said, I can give you a simple example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract. For the sake of simplicity, Ill use a wellknown futures contract the Emini SP500 contract. Each Emini is worth 50 times the value of the SP 500 index and has a tick size of 0.25, so the minimum price change is 0.25  50  12.50. Heres an example. Say the current value of the SP500 is 1,600 the value of each contract is therefore 50  1,600  80,000. You purchase one contract on margin, with an initial margin requirement1 of 5, or 4,000. If the SP 500 index rises to 1,610, the value of your futures contract increases to 50  1,610  80,500. Once you return the 80,000  4,000  76,000 that you borrowed as leverage, your profit is 80,500  76,000  4,500. Since you used 4,000 of your own funds as an initial margin, your profit, excluding commissions is 4,500  4,000  500, which is a 5004000  12.5 return. If the index dropped to 1,580, the value of your futures contract decreases to 50  1,580  79,000. After you return the 76,000 in leverage, youre left with 3,000, or a net loss of 3,000  40004000  25. The math illustrates why using leverage increases your risk, but also increases your potential for return. Consider the first scenario, in which the index increases to 1,610. If you had forgone using margin and spent 80,000 of your own funds, your profit would be 80,500  80,000  80000  .625. This is smaller than your leveraged profit by a factor of 20, the inverse of the margin requirement .625  .05  12.5. In this case, the use of leverage dramatically increased your rate of return. However, in the case of a decrease, you spent 80,000, but gained 79,000, for a loss of only 1.25. This is 20 times smaller in magnitude than your negative return when using leverage. By forgoing leverage, youve decreased your opportunity for upside, but also decreased your downside risk. 1 For futures contracts, the margin requirements are set by the exchange, which is CME group, in the case of the Emini. The 5 in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement, which is currently 3,850 USD per contract, but it keeps the numbers simple. Also note that CME group refers to the initial margin as the performance bond instead."

At 10 percent per year, 5 or 10 years. At 100 percent per year, a few months.

Specifically in this case it depends upon your view of the FX Foreign Exchange market over the next few years, and how sensitive you are to losses. As you correctly note, a hedge has a cost, so it detracts from your overall return. But given that you need to repatriate the investment eventually to US Dollars, you need to be aware of the fluctuations of the dollar versus other currencies. If you believe that over your time horizon, the US dollar will be worth the same as now or less, then you should not buy the hedge. If the dollar is the same  the choice iswas obvious. If you believe the US dollar will be weaker in the future, that means that when you repatriate back to US dollars, you will purchase more dollars with your foreign currency. If on the other hand, you believe the US Dollar will get stronger, then you should certainly lock in some kind of hedge. That way, when your foreign currency would have effectively bought fewer US, you will have made money on the hedge to make up the difference. If you choose not to hedge now, you can likely hedge that exposure at any time in the future, separate from the initial investment purchase buy buyingselling the appropriate FX instrument. Good Luck"

These orders stay in the book and are filled when the price of the security moves and triggers them. So direct answer is NYSE ARCA is where market makers do their jobs. These market makers can be floor traders or algorithmic. When you send an order through your brokerage, your broker has a number of options. Your order can be sent directly to an ECNexchange like NYSE ARCA, sent to a market making firm like KCG Americas formerly Knight Capital, or internalized.

An IRA with me as sole beneficiary regardless of the will saying \"all my assets I leave to the ASPCA.\" This is also a warning to keep that beneficiary current. Its possible that ones exspouse is still on IRA or 401k accounts as beneficiary and new spouse is in for a surprise when hubbywife passes. Sorry for the tangent, but this is all important to know. The funneling of a beneficiary IRA through a trust is not for amateurs. If set up incorrectly, the trust will not allow the stretchlifetime withdrawals, but will result in a broken IRA. Trusts are not cheap, nor would I have any faith in any attorney setting it up. I would only use an attorney who specializes in Trusts and Estate planning. As littleadv suggested, they dont have to be minors. It turns out that the expense to set up the trust 1K2K depending on location can help keep your adult child from blowing through a huge IRA quickly. Id suggest that the trust distribute the RMDs in early years, and a higher amount, say 10 in years to follow, unless you want it to go just RMD for its entire life. Or greater flexibility releasing larger amounts based on life events. The tough part of that is you need a trustee who is willing to handle this and will do it at a low cost. If you go with Childs name only, I dont know many 1821 year old kids who would either understand the RMD rules on IRAs or be willing to use the money over decades instead of blowing it.

    "body": "For the person being hired this is a tricky situation. Specially with the new laws. There is no real magic number that can be applied as a lot will depend on what benefits you want, and what is actually available. This will really shift the spectrum quite a bit. Under the affordibal care act, everyone has to have insurance or pay a ?fine? were really not sure what to call this yet but there are two provisions that really mess with the numbers you look at as an employee. First, the cost of heath care has skyrocketed. So the same benefits that you had 5 years ago now cost maybe 1015 times as much as they used to. This gets swept under the rug a bit because the \"main costs\" of insurance has only increased a tiny amount. What this actually comes down to is does your new ACA approved heath plan cover exactly the benefits you need, or does it cut corners. Sorry this is complicated, and I dont mean it to come off as a speech against the ACA so I will give an example. My wife has RA, she really has it under control with the help of her RA doctor. This is not something she ever wants to change. Because she has had RA from the age of 15, and because its degenerative, she doesnt want to spend 5 years working with a new doctor to get to the same place she is with her current doctor. In addition, the main drugs she takes for RA are not covered under any ACA plan, nor are the \"substitutions\" that her doctor makes we are trying to have kids so she has to be off the main meds, and a couple of the things this doctor has tried has been meds that reduce inflammation, are pregnancy safe, but are not for the treatment of RA You now have to take into effect rather the cost of health insurance  the cost of the things now not covered by the heath insurance  the out of pocket expenses is worth the insurance. Second the ACA has set up provisions to straight up trick those people that have lower income and are not paying close attention. When shopping for insurance, they get quotes like \"50 a month\" or \"100 a month\". The truth is that the remainder of the actual cost is deducted from their tax returns. This takes consideration, because if you thing your paying 50 a month for insurance but your really paying 650 then you need to make sure your doing your math right. Finally, you need to understand how messed up things are right now in the US with heath care. Largely this goes unreported. Im not really sure why. But in order to do this I will have to give examples. For my wife to see a specialist her RA doctor the copay is 75. So she goes to the doctor, he charges her 75 and bills the insurance 200. The insurance pays the doctor 50. With out insurance, the visit costs 50. At first you want to blame the doctor for cheating the system, but the doctor has to pay for hours of labor to get the 50 back from the insurance company. From the doctors perspective its cheaper to take the 50 then it is to charge the insurance company. And by charging the insurance company he has no control over the cost of the co pay. He essentially has to charge more to make the same money and the patient gets the shaft in the process. Another example, I got strep throat last year. I went to the walk in clinic, paid 75, saw the doctor got my ZPack for 15, went home crawled in bed and got better. My wife who still had separate insurance from before the marriage got strep throat imagen that went to the same clinic, they charged her 200 for the visit 50 copay and 250 for the zpack 3 copay. The insurance paid the clinic 90 for the visit and 3 for the drugs. Again the patient is left out in this scenario. In this case it worked better for my wife, unless you account for the fact that to get that coverage she had to pay 650month. My point is that when comparing costs of heathcare with insurance, and without out insurance, its often times much cheaper for the practices to have you self pay then it is for them to go through the loops of trying to insurance to make them whole. This creates two rates. Self pay rates and Insured rates. When your trying to figure out the cost of not having insurance then you need to use the self pay rates. These can be vastly different. So as an employee you need to figure out your cost of heath care with insurance, and your cost of heath care without insurance. Then user those numbers when your trying to negotiate a salary. The problem is that there is no magic number to use for this because the cost will very a lot. For us, it was cheaper to not have insurance. Even with a preexisting condition that takes constant attention, its just better if we set aside 500 a month then it is to try to pay 750 a month. That might not hold true for everyone. For some people or conditions it may be better to pay the 750 then to try to handle it themselves. So for my negotiations I would go with x6,000 without insurance or x4,500 with insurance. Now as an employer its a lot simpler. Usually you have a \"group plan\" that offers you a pretty straight x per year per person or y per year per family. So you can offer exactly that. Salary  x or Salary  y. AS a starting point. However this is where negotiations start. If your offering me 50,500 and insurance, I would rather just have 57,000 and no insurance. Of course your real cost is only 55,000 cause you dont care about my heath care costs only about insurance costs. So you try to negotiate down towards 55,000 and no insurance. But thats not good enough for me. So I either go else where and you loose talent, or I accept 50,500 and insurance or somewhere in between."

Like any other item that has limited resale value, your best option may be to donate it. A quick Google search will turn up some options. This will likely be less hassle than selling. Also, you have a potential tax writeoff."

    "body": "They all basically mean the same thing  a type of debt than can be exchanged for converted into equity at some point. Its only the mechanics that can be different. A convertible bond is structured just like a regular bond  it usually pays periodic interest and has a face value thats due at maturity. The difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond. There can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible, and they typically define a quantity of equity number of shares that the bond can be converted into. If the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond, its in the best interest of the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value thats redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round. Rather than specifying a specific number of shares, the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market. So they both are debt instruments that can turn into equity investments, just through different mechanisms. A debenture is a fancy word for unsecured debt, and convertible debt could be used to described either structure above, so those terms could mean either type of structure."

If this really is a case of compulsive spending, curing it is likely to be a long, hard process, if its even possible. You need to put yourself in a position where you wont be dragged down with him."
