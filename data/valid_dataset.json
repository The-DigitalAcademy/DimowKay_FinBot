    "content": "The Securities Investor Protection Corporation is roughly analogous to the FDIC for investments. There are some important differences like a lack of 100 guarantee you get all of your funds back. The SIPC understands you invested knowing there was some risk, and therefore you take that same risk in getting your money from a failed brokerage. However there is still a level of commitment and trust that lessen the risk of investing in the wrong place. Also, do not typo the acronym at your work computer. In the US and perhaps elsewhere it is a racist term, and you are likely to get some bad search results. httpwww.sipc.orghowbrochure.cfm"

    "content": "I expected a word or two on the price elasticity of demand here  Andrey, Your question needs slight revision in its current form. Rising prices actually do not mean increased profitability for a company. The quantity they sell also pays a huge part and actually is correlated to the price at which they sell the goods and other factors such as the price at which their competitor sells the goods etc., but we will ignore it for simplicity. The net profit of sales for any firm is equal to Qty x Sale Price  COGS  SGA  taxes  other expenses where, COGS means cost of goods sold SGA means sales, general and admin costs e.g., cleaning the inventory storage area daily so that the goods stay fresh etc. other expenses include any miscellaneous other costs that the firm incurs to make the sale. Now, if everything in that equation remains same COGS, SGA, taxes, and other expenditures, rising prices will only translate into a higher profit if the quantity does not fall by the same margin. Prices may also rise simply as a response to risking COGS, SGA or other expenditures the latter may be observed in inflationary environments. In such a case, the supplying firm can end up losing its profit margin if the quantity falls by more than the price rise."

    "content": "You could, but the bank wont let you... If youre a sole proprietor  then you could probably open a personal account and just use it, and never tell them that is actually a business. However, depending on your volume of operations, they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions. For corporations, you cannot use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds. Also, youre generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection which is why you have the corporation to begin with. Generally, business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts, and it costs more for the banks to run them. In the US, some banks offer free, or very lowcost, business accounts for small businesses that dont need too many transactions. Im sure if you shop around, youll find those in Canada as well."

Thats an important distinction, because the US has the best credit in the world and still carries enormous borrowing power  so much so that the massive increases in borrowing over the last decade of war and malaise have not affected the nations ability to borrow additional money. From a personal finance point of view, my guess is that after the \"drop dead date\" disclosed by the Treasury, youd have a period of chaos and increasing liquidity issues after government runs out of gimmicks like \"borrowing\" from various internal accounts and \"selling\" assets to government authorities.

    "topic": "Fractional Reserve Banking and Insolvency",
    "content": "It certainly is possible for a run on the bank to drive it into insolvency. And yes, if the bank makes some bad loans, it can magnify the problem. Generally, this does not happen, though. Remember that banks usually have lots of customers, and people are depositing money and making mortgage payments every day, so there is usually enough onhand to cover average banking withdrawl activity, regardless of any bad loans they have outstanding. Banks have lots of historical data to know what the average withdrawl demands are for a given day. They also have risk models to predict the likelihood of their loans going into default. A bank will generally use this information to strike a healthy balance between profitmaking activity e.g. issuing loans, and satisfying its account holders. In the event of a major withdrawl demand, there are some protections in place to guard against insolvency. There are regulations that specify a Reserve Requirement. The bank must keep a certain amount of money on hand, so they cant take huge risks by loaning out too much money all at once. Regulators can tweak this requirement over time to reflect the current economic situation. If a bank does run into trouble, it can take out a shortterm loan. Either from another bank, or from the central bank e.g. the US Federal Reserve. Banks dont want to pay interest on loans any more than you do, so if they are regularly borrowing money, they will adjust thier cash reserves accordingly. If all else fails and the bank cant meet its obligations e.g. the Fed loan fell through, the bank has an insurance policy to make sure the account holders get paid. In the US, this is what the FDIC is for. Worst case, the bank goes under, but your money is safe. These protections have worked pretty well for many decades. However, during the recent financial crisis, all three of these protections were under heavy strain. So, one of the things banking regulators did was to put the major banks through stress tests to make sure they could handle several bad financial events without collapsing. These tests showed that some banks didnt have enough money in reserve. Not long after, banks started to increase fees and credit card rates to raise this additional capital. Keep in mind that if banks were unable to use the deposited money loan it out, invest it, etc, the current financial landscape would change considerably."

Either way this allows a lower tax rate for LLC profits. Im not sure that correct. I know it has something to do with capital accounts. This is incorrect. As to capital accounts  these are accounts representing the memberspartners capital in the enterprise, and have nothing to do with the tax treatment of the earnings. Undistributed earnings add to the capital accounts, but theyre still taxed. Also, is it true that if the LLC loses money, that loss can be offset against other taxable income resulting in a lower total taxation? It can offset taxable income of the same kind, just like any other losses on your tax return. Generally, flowthrough taxation of partnerships means that the income is taxed to the partner with the original attributes. If it is capital gains  it is taxed as capital gains. If it is earned income  it is taxed as earned income. Going through LLCpartnership doesnt recharacterize the income going through corporation  does, in many cases."

You should report this as a Capital Loss, the same way all of the Enron shareholders did in their 2001 tax returns. Your cost basis is whatever you originally paid for the shares.

IRS publication 547 states Decline in market value of stock. You cant deduct as a theft loss the decline in market value of stock acquired on the open market for investment if the decline is caused by disclosure of accounting fraud or other illegal misconduct by the officers or directors of the corporation that issued the stock. However, you can deduct as a capital loss the loss you sustain when you sell or exchange the stock or the stock becomes completely worthless. You report a capital loss on Schedule D Form 1040.

    "topic": "Over the long term, why invest in bonds?",
    "content": "Many folks use bonds to diversify their portfolio since bonds rise and fall in value at different times and for different reasons than stocks. Bonds pay interest on a regular basis usually monthly or quarterly and so some people invest in bonds in order to match the interest payments to some regular expense they might have. The interest payment does not change fixed income. For individual bonds, there is a maturity date at which you can expect to receive the face value of the bond the issuers creditworthiness is important here. You can make a little money on a bond by buying it when its value is lower than its face value and either selling later for a higher value, or waiting for it to mature. Often the minimum investment for a single bond is high, so if you dont have a large enough amount, you can still get the performance of bonds through a bond fund. These do not mature, so you dont have a guarantee of a return of your investment. However, they have access to more bonds than retail investors, so the funds can keep your money more fully invested. If you dont need the income, you can reinvest the dividends and have a little extra capital growth this way."

    "topic": "What is the purpose of property tax?",
    "content": "Property taxes, where they exist, are generally levied by cities, counties and other locallevel administrative bodies like MUDs, and are the primary source of revenue at these levels of government. These taxes pay the lions share of the expenses for basic services provided by a city or county There are federal dollars, other revenue sources State lottery revenues often go toward public schools for instance, and \"usage fees\" vehicle registration, utility bills, toll roads at play as well, but a lot of that money covers largerscale infrastructure development freewaysinterstates and specialized \"earmarks\" political backscratching involving this bridge or that dam in a Congresscritters home district, a few national initiatives from the Presidents budget like firstresponder technology upgrades for improved disasterterrorism readiness. Property taxes are the main funding for the daytoday government operations at the most visible level to the average resident. The theory behind using a property tax instead of some other form of taxation like income is that the value of the property and the quality of services provided to the residents of that property are interrelated the property is valuable in part because the infrastructure is wellmaintained and nearby schoolshospitals are good, and by the same token, affluent residents expect highquality services. Property taxes are also easier to levy, because most of the work can be done by the tax assessor monitor recent sale prices, do drivebys through neighborhoods, come up with a number and send the resident the bill. Thats opposed to sales taxes which businesses operating in the jurisdiction have to calculate, collect and turn over, or income taxes which require residents to fill out paperwork to calculate how much they owe. The justification is eminent domain. Its very simple when you buy land in the U.S. and a State thereof, you are still a citizen andor resident of that State and the U.S., and subject to their laws. Youre not creating your own country when you buy a house. As such, the government charges you for the facilities and services they provide in your area and your State, which are then your privilege to use. Obviously roads arent free a onemile stretch behind my house is costing the county 15 million to expand it from 2lane to 4lane. Heres the kicker youve already been paying these taxes. You think your landlords just going to take the property taxes for the whole apartment complex on the chin? Hes out to make money, and doing that requires charging a sufficient amount to cover costs, including taxes he incurs. You just never see \"allocated property taxes\" as an item on your rent statement, just like you dont see \"allocated landowner mortgage\", \"allocated facilities maintenance\", \"allocated gross margin\" etc. You know youre getting shafted, paying someone elses financing with a little extra on the side to boot. Thats why you want a house. Unfortunately, not being able to pay these taxes is a grim reality for some people, old and young, and government generally doesnt go easy on delinquent homeowners. After medical bills and mortgage delinquency, property tax delinquency is the number three reason for bankruptcy, and only a mortgage or property tax delinquency can cause your home to be seized and sold. Well that and using it for criminal enterprise, but unless youre running a meth lab in your halfmilliondollar home or financing it with coke money I wouldnt worry about that score. Retirement planners figure property taxes into cost of living, and they do often advise a downgrade from the 2story house you raised your children in to something smaller for many reasons, including lower taxes. There really isnt a way to structure a completely \"payasyougo\" metropolitan area, and you wouldnt want to live in it if there were. Imagine every strip of asphalt in the county being a toll road where your transponder TollTag, EZPass, etc or license plate was scanned and you were billed at each intersection. In addition to being a huge invasion of privacy, the cost to maintain this network and your cost to use it would skyrocket. Imagine 911 asking for a credit card number before dispatching police, fire or EMS Ambulance services already do bill on a perevent basis, but youd be surprised how few people pay and how little power a county EMS has to enforce collection without a property tax and Medicaid to cover the difference, EMS service could not be provided in most counties."

I am definitely antilandlord in these situations because Ive had to deal with so many bad ones here in NYC, but as a landlord, the best thing you can do is to create a \"buffer\" account for you to deposit tenant rent money into, then transfer the money from the buffer account to your regular account. This would prevent the tenant from knowing your personal bank information and greatly delay the tenant receiving his judgement from an assumed court win against you. My source I had to take my landlord to court, and after obtaining a judgement, I got a court marshall to begin the process of closing access to her account she couldnt access the money in that account.

Also see httpmeyersandheim.comhowtowinaninsidertradingcase However, between these two extremes of a bystander with no duty to the corporation and a corporate officer with a clear duty to the corporation stood a whole group of people such as printers, lawyers and others who were involved in nonpublic transactions that did not necessarily have a duty to the company whose securities they traded. To address this group of people the courts developed the misappropriation theory. The misappropriation theory covers people who posses inside information and who are prohibited from trading on such information because they owe a duty to a third party and not the corporation whose securities are traded. Yours is the perfect example. You owe a duty to your employer to operate in its best interests. As for the broader, more common example, where you overhear information in an elevator, restaurant, in line at the coffee shop, etc., trading on such information was found not to be insider trading in SEC v.

    "topic": "Why do new car loans, used car loans, and refinanced loans have different rates and terms?",
    "content": "There are normally three key factors that define different kinds of loans, these factors affect the risk that the lender takes on and so the interest rate. The interest rate on any loan is linked to market interest rates the lender shouldnt be able to receive a higher rate of interest for lending the money at no risk, and the level of risk that the lender believes the borrower to have. The three features of a particular loan are These reduce the risk of complete or total nonpayment default of the principal or any missed interest payments. Taken in order Amortising Here some of the monthly payment pays a proportion of the underlying principal of the loan. This reduces the amount outstanding and so reduces the capacity for default on the full principal as part of the principal has already been paid. Security In a secured loan there is an asset such as a car, house, boat, gold, shares etc. that has a value on resale that is held against the loan. The lender may repossess the security if the borrower defaults and recover their money that way. This also acts as a \"stick\" using the loss of property to convince the borrower that it is better to keep paying the interest. The future value of the security will be taken into account when deciding how much this reduces the interest rate. Guarantor A guarantor to a loan guarantees that the borrower will repay the loan and interest in full and, if the borrower does not fulfil that obligation, the lender is able to seek legal redress from the guarantor for the borrowers debts. Each of these reduce the risk of the loan as detailed and so reduce the interest rate. The interest rate, then, is made up of three parts the market interest rate m plus the interest rate premium for the borrowers own credit worthiness c minus the value of the features of the loan that help to reduce risk l. The interest rate of the loan r is categorised as r  m  c  l. Credit ratings themselves are an inexact science and even when two lenders are looking at the same credit score for the same person they will give a different interest rate premium. This is mostly for business reasons, and the shape of their loan book, that are too tedious to go through here. All in all the different types of loan give flexibility at the cost of a different interest rate. If you dont want the chance of your car being repossessed you dont take a secured loan, if you have a family member who can help and doesnt mind taking on your risk take a guaranteed loan."

People who do this every day for a living have a hard time doing that, and Im guessing you dont have that kind of time and knowledge. So that leaves you with your first and third options, commonly called lumpsum and dollar cost averaging respectively. Which one to use depends on where your preferences lie on the riskreward scpectrum. Dollar cost averaging DCA has lower risk and lower reward than lump sum investing. In my opinion, I dont like it. DCA only works better than lump sum investing if the price drops. But if you think the price is going to drop, why are you buying the stock in the first place? Example Your uncle wins the lottery and gives you 50,000. Do you buy 50,000 worth of Apple now, or do you buy 10,000 now and 10,000 a quarter for the next four quarters? If the stock goes up, you will make more with lumpsumLS than you will with DCA. If the stock goes down, you will lose more with LS than you will with DCA. If the stock goes up then down, you will lose more with DCA than you will with LS. If the stock goes down then up, you will make more with DCA than you will with LS. So its a tradeoff. But, like I said, the whole point of you buying the stock is that you think its going to go up, which is especially true with an index fund! So why pick the strategy that performs worse in that scenario?"

If the interest is higher than you could earn in a savings account, then it is smarter to pay them off at once. My student loans are 1.8, so I can earn more money in my mutual funds. Im suspicious and think something hinky is going to happen with the fiscal cliff negotiations, so Im going to be paying off my student loans in early 2013. Disclaimer I have IRA accounts with both Fidelity and Vanguard. My current 401k plan is with Vanguard."

    "topic": "Capital Gains in an S Corp",
    "content": "A nondividend distribution is typically a return of capital in other words, youre getting money back that youve contributed previously and thus would have been taxed upon in previous years when those funds were first remunerated to you. Nondividend distributions are nontaxable, so they do not represent income from capital gains, but do effect your cost basis when determining the capital gainloss once that capital gainloss is realized. As an example, publiclytraded real estate investment trusts REITs generally distribute a return of capital back to shareholders throughout the year as a nondividend distribution. This is a return of a portion of the shareholders original capital investment, not a share of the REITs profits, so it is simply getting a portion of your original investment back, and thus, is not income being received I like to refer to it as \"new income\" to differentiate. However, the return of capital does change the cost basis of the original investment, so if one were to then sell the shares of the REIT in this example, the basis of the original investment has to be adjusted by the nondividend distributions received over the course of ownership in other words, the cost basis will be reduced when the shares are sold. Im wondering if the OP could give us some additional information about hisher SCorp. What type of business is it? In the course of its business and trade activity, does it buy and sell securities stocks, etc.? Does it sell assets or business property? Does it own interests in other corporations or partnerships sales of those interests are one form of capital gain. Longterm capital gains are taxed at rates lower than ordinary income, but the IRS has very specific rules as to what constitutes a capital gain loss. I hate to answer a question with a question, but we need a little more information before we can weighin on whether you have actual capital gains or losses in the course of your SCorporation trade."

    "content": "Assuming that what you want to do is to counter the capital gains tax on the short term and long term gains, and that doing so will avoid any underpayment penalties, it is relatively simple to do so. Figure out the tax on the capital gains by determining your tax bracket. Lets say 25 short term and 15 long term or 0.25x7K  0.158K or 2950. If you donate to charities an additional amount of items or money to cover that tax. So taking the numbers in step 1 divide by the marginal tax rate 29500.25 or 11,800. Money is easier to donate because you will be contributing enough value that the IRS may ask for proof of the value, and that proof needs to be gathered either before the donation is given or at the time the donation is given. Also dont wait until December 31st, if you miss the deadline and the donation is counted for next year, the purpose will have been missed. Now if the goal is just to avoid the underpayment penalty, you have two other options. The safe harbor is the easiest of the two to determine. Look at last years tax form. Look for the amount of tax you paid last year. Not what was withheld, but what you actually paid. If all your withholding this year, is greater than 110 of the total tax from last year, you have reached the safe harbor. There are a few more twists depending on AGI Special rules for farmers, fishermen, and higher income taxpayers. If at least twothirds of your gross income for tax year 2014 or 2015 is from farming or fishing, substitute 6623 for 90 in 2a under the General rule, earlier. If your AGI for 2014 was more than 150,000 75,000 if your filing status for 2015 is married filing a separate return, substitute 110 for 100 in 2b under General rule , earlier.

If they want to try to use a volatile asset as collateral and have to figure out how to cover when the price drops temporarily, great. But why should they put that risk on your other investors who may not be so crazy? Also, this obviously wont meet the investors concerns anyway.

    "topic": "If I believe a stock is going to fall, what options do I have to invest on this?",
    "content": "Aganju has mentioned put options, which are one good possibility. I would suggest considering an even easier strategy short selling. Technically you are borrowing the stock from someone and selling it. At some point you repurchase the stock to return to the lender \"covering your short\". If the stock price has fallen, then when you repurchase it, it will be cheaper and you keep the profit. Short selling sounds complicated but its actually very easyyour broker takes care of all the details. Just go to your brokerage and click \"sell\" or \"sell short.\" You can use a market or limit order just like you were selling something you own. When it sells, you are done. The money gets credited to your account. At some point after the price falls you should repurchase it so you dont have a negative position any more, but your brokerage isnt going to hassle you for this unless you bought a lot and the stock price starts rising. There will be limits on how much you can short, depending on how much money is in your account. Some stocks distressed and small stocks may sometimes be hard to short, meaning your broker will charge you a kind of interest andor may not be able to complete your transaction. You will need a margin account a type of brokerage account to either use options or short sell. They are easy to come by, though. Note that for a given amount of starting money in your account, puts can give you a much more dramatic gain if the stock price falls. But they can and often do expire worthless, causing you to lose all money you have spent on them. If you want to maximize how much you make, use puts. Otherwise Id short sell. About IPOs, it depends on what you mean. If the IPO has just completed and you want to bet that the share price will fall, either puts or short selling will work. Before an IPO you cant short sell and I doubt you would be able to buy an option either. Foreign stocks? Depends on whether there is an ADR for them that trades on the domestic market and on the details of your brokerage account. Let me put it this way, if you can buy it, you can short sell it."

My goal is that we pay all the bills and save a decent amount and have roughly the same amount to spend each month. So each persons spending money should be roughly equal. I then fine tune this as things change if we get a pay rise we alter it, if a bill goes up or down we alter it To manage this we have 4 accounts, a joint account to pay bills both give a set amount to each mont, a savings acount both give a set amount to each month and our own accounts where we get paid and where our spending money lives.

    "topic": "What is the difference between hedging and diversification? How does each reduce risk?",
    "content": "The difference is in the interrelation between the varied investments you make. Hedging is about specifically offsetting a possible loss in an investment by making another related investment that will increase in value for the same reasons that the original investment would lose value. Gold, for instance, is often regarded as the ultimate hedge. Its value is typically inversely correlated to the rest of the market as a whole, because its status as a material, durable store of value makes it a preferred \"safe haven\" to move money into in times of economic downturn, when stock prices, bond yields and similar investments are losing value. That specific behavior makes investing in gold alongside stocks and bonds a \"hedge\" the increase in value of gold as stock prices and bond yields fall limits losses in those other areas. Investment of cash in gold is also specifically a hedge against currency inflation paper money, account balances, and even debt instruments like bonds and CDs can lose real value over time in a \"hot\" economy where theres more money than things to buy with it. By keeping a store of value in something other than currency, the price of that good will rise as the currencies used to buy it decrease in real value, maintaining your level of real wealth. Other hedges are more localized. One might, for example, trade oil futures as a hedge on a position in transportation stocks when oil prices rise, trucking and airline companies suffer in the short term as their margins get squeezed due to fuel costs. Currency futures are another popular hedge a company in international business will often trade options on the currencies of the companies it does business in, to limit the \"jitters\" seen in the FOREX spot market caused by speculation and other transient changes in market demand. Diversification, by contrast, is about choosing multiple unrelated investments, the idea being to limit losses due to a localized change in the market. Companies stocks gain and lose value every day, and those companies can also go out of business without bringing the entire economy to its knees. By spreading your wealth among investments in multiple industries and companies of various sizes and global locations, you insulate yourself against the risk that any one of them will fail. If, tomorrow, Kroger grocery stores went bankrupt and shuttered all its stores, people in the regions it serves might be inconvenienced, but the market as a whole will move on. You, however, would have lost everything if youd bet your retirement on that one stock. Nobody does that in the real world instead, you put some of your money in Kroger, some in Microsoft, some in Home Depot, some in ALCOA, some in PGE, etc etc. By investing in stocks that would be more or less unaffected by a downturn in another, if Kroger went bankrupt tomorrow you would still have, say, 95 of your investment next egg still alive, well and continuing to pay you dividends. The flip side is that if tomorrow, Kroger announced an exclusive deal with the Girl Scouts to sell their cookies, making them the only place in the country you can get them, you would miss out on the full possible amount of gains youd get from the price spike if you had bet everything on Kroger. Hindsights always 2020 I could have spent some beer money to buy Bitcoins when they were changing hands for pennies apiece, and Id be a multimillionaire right now.

    "content": "Defined Benefit Plans Defined benefit plans are disappearing because of their high cost to the companies that provide them. When an employee retires, the company must pay his pension for the rest of his life, even longer if the pension includes a survivor option. Thus the companys financial burden grows as more employees retire. By law, they must provide a fund that has sufficient resources to pay all present and future pensions. Low interest rates, such as we have now, place a greater burden on the amount that must be in these funds. For these reasons, most companies, including large ones like IBM and Lockheed Martin, have discontinued their pension plans and provide only defined contribution plans. Defined Contribution Plans These require the company to only make contributions while the employee is working. Once the employee retires, the companys responsibility ends. Usually these plans employ a 401K type savings plan for which the employee contributes and the companies matches some or all of that contribution. Comparison Although a fully company paid pension plan is the best, it is now almost unavailable. The defined contribution plan, if it includes company matching, can be a viable alternative if the investments are chosen wisely and perform as expected. Of course, this is not guaranteed but is probably the best option that most working people have at this time."

    "content": "Think of it this way, if you traveled back through time one month  with perfect knowledge of AAPLs stock price over that period  which happens to peak viciously then return to its old price at the end of the period  wouldnt you pay more for an American option? Another way to think about options is as an insurance policy. Wouldnt you pay more for a policy that covered fire and earthquake losses as opposed to just losses from earthquakes? Lastly  and perhaps most directly  one of the more common reasons people exercise as opposed to sell an American option before expiration is if an unexpected dividend larger than remaining time value of the option was just announced thats going to be paid before the option contract expires. Because only actual stockholders get the dividends, not options holders. A holder of an American option has the ability to exercise in time to grab that dividend  a European option holder doesnt have that ability. Less flexibility what youre paying for really  lower option premium."

    "content": "If you selected a mortgage that allows additional payments to be credited against the principal rather than as early payment of normal installments, them yes, doing so will reduce the actual cost of the loan. You may have to explicitly instruct the bank to use the money this way each time, if prepay is their default assumption. Check with your lender, andor read the terms of your mortgage, to find out if this is allowed and how to do it. If your mortgage doesnt allow additional payments against the principal, you may want to consider refinancing into a mortgage which does, or into a mortgage with shorter term and higher monthly payments, to obtain the same lower cost modulo closing costs on the new mortgage run the numbers."

    "content": "After learning about things that happened in the \"flash crash\" I always use limit orders. In an extremely rare instance if you place a market order when there is a some glitch, for example some large trader adds a zero at the end of their volume, you could get an awful price. If I want to buy at the market price, I just set the limit about 1 above the market price. If I want to sell, I set the limit 1 below the market price. I should point out that your trade is not executed at the limit price. If your limit price on a buy order is higher than the lowest offer, you still get filled at the lowest offer. If before your order is submitted someone fills all offers up to your limit price, you will get your limit price. If someone, perhaps by accident, fills all orders up to twice your limit price, you wont end up making the purchase. I have executed many purchases this way and never been filled at my limit price."

    "topic": "What is the tax treatment of scrip dividends in the UK?",
    "content": "I wrote about this in another answer You can sell the scrip dividend in the market the capital gain from this sale may fall below the annual taxfree allowance for capital gains, in which case you dont pay any capital gains tax on that amount. For a cash dividend, however, there isnt a minimum taxable amount, so you would owe dividend tax on the entire dividend and may therefore pay more taxes on a cash dividend. Since you havent sold the shares in the market yet, you havent earned any income on the shares. You dont owe taxes on the scrip until you sell the shares and earn capital gains on them. HMRC is very explicit about this, in CG33800 It is quite common for a company, particularly a quoted company, to offer its shareholders the option of receiving additional shares instead of a cash dividend. The expression stock or scrip dividend is used to describe shares issued in such circumstances. The basic position under tax law is that when a company makes a bonus issue of shares no distribution arises, and the bonus issue of shares is not income for tax purposes in the hands of the recipient. Obviously, if this is an issue for you, talk to a tax professional to make sure you get it right."

You never want to pay the government any taxes early and you dont want to reduce the balance. beyond that, A lot depends on how long you figure you will be with that company. If its only a few years, or if you and other employees can make enough of a fuss that they move the fund to someplace decent any of the big noload companies such as Vanguard would be a better custodian, then Id go ahead and max it out. If you figure to be there for a long while, and it looks like someone is in bed with the custodian and theres no way it will be changed, then maybe look to max out a Roth IRA instead."

    "topic": "Avoiding timing traps with long term index investing",
    "content": "What are the risks pertaining to timing on long term index investments? The risks are countless for any investment strategy. If you invest in US stocks, and prices revert to the long term cyclically adjusted average, you will lose a lot of money. If you invest in cash, inflation may outpace interest rates and you will lose money. If you invest in gold, the price might go down and you will lose money. Its best to study history and make a reasonable decision i.e. invest in stocks. Here are long term returns by asset class, computed by Jeremy Siegel 1 invested in equities in 1801 equals 15.22 today if was not invested and 8.8 million if it was invested in stocks. This is the magic of compound interest and cash  bonds have not been nearly as magical as stocks historically. 2 How large are these risks? The following chart shows the largest drawdowns decreases in the value of an asset since 1970 source Asset prices decrease in value frequently. Financial assets are volatile, but historically, they have increased over time, enabling investors to earn compounded returns exponential growth of money is how to get rich. I personally view drawdowns as an excellent time to buy  its like going on a shopping spree when everything in the store is discounted. 3 In case I feel not prepared to take these risks, how can I avoid them? The optimal asset allocation depends on the ability to take risk and your tolerance for risk. You are young and have a long investment horizon, so if stocks go down, you will have plenty of time to wait for them to go back up if youre smart, youll buy more stocks when they go down because theyre cheap, so your ability to bear risk is high. From your description, it seems like you have a low risk tolerance despite a high ability to be exposed to risk. Heres the return of various asset classes and how the average investor has fared over the last 20 years source Get educated read Common Sense on Mutual Funds, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, etc. and dont be average! Closing words Investing in a globally diversified portfolio with a dollar cost averaging strategy is the best strategy for most investors. For investors that are unable to stay rational when markets are volatile i.e. the investor uncontrollably sells their stocks when stocks decrease 20, a more conservative asset allocation is recommended. Due to the nature of compounded interest, a conservative portfolio is likely to have a much lower future value."

    "topic": "Pay off mortgage or invest in high value saving account",
    "content": "Basically, the easiest way to do this is to chart out the \"whatifs\". Applying the amortization formula see here using the numbers you supplied and a little guesswork, I calculated an interest rate of 3.75 which is good and that youve already made 17 semimonthly payments 8 and a half months worth of 680.04, out of a 30year, 720payment loan term. These are the numbers I will use. Lets now suppose that tomorrow, you found 100 extra every two weeks in your budget, and decided to put it toward your mortgage starting with the next payment. That makes the semimonthly payments 780 each. You would pay off the mortgage in 23 years making 557 more payments instead of 703 more. Your total payments will be 434,460, down from 478.040, so your interest costs on the loan were reduced by 43,580 but, my mistake, we cant count this amount as money in the bank its included in the next amount of money to come in. Now, after the mortgage is paid off, you have 780 semimonthly for the remaining 73 months of your original 30year loan a total of 113,880 which you can now do something else with. If you stuffed it in your mattress, youd earn 0 and so thats the worstcase scenario. For anything else to be worth it, you must be getting a rate of return such that 100 payments, 24 times a year for a total of 703 payments must equal 113,880. We use the future value annuity formula here v  pi1n1i, plugging in v 113880, our FV goal, 100 for P the monthly payment and 703 for n total number of payments. Were looking for i, the interest rate. Were making 24 payments per year, so the value of i we find will be 124 of the stated annual interest rate of any account you put it into. We find that in order to make the same amount of money on an annuity that you save by paying off the loan, the interest rate on the account must average 3.07. However, youre probably not going to stuff the savings from the mortgage in your mattress and sleep on it for 6 years. What if you invest it, in the same security youre considering now? That would be 146 payments of 780 into an interestbearing account, plus the interest savings. Now, the interest rate on the security must be greater, because youre not only saving money on the mortgage, youre making money on the savings. Assuming the annuity APR stays the same now vs later, we find that the APR on the annuity must equal, surprise, 3.75 in order to end up with the same amount of money. Why is that? Well, the interest growing on your 100 semimonthly exactly offsets the interest you would save on the mortgage by reducing the principal by 100. Both the loan balance you would remove and the annuity balance you increase would accrue the same interest over the same time if they had the same rate. The main difference, to you, is that by paying into the annuity now, you have cash now by paying into the mortgage now, you dont have money now, but you have WAY more money later. The actual real timevalues of the money, however, are the same the future value of 200mo for 30 years is equal to 0mo for 24 years and then 1560mo for 6 years, but the real money paid in over 30 years is 72,000 vs 112,320. That kind of math is why analysts encourage people to start retirement saving early. One more thing. If you live in the United States, the interest charges on your mortgage are taxdeductible. So, that 43,580 you saved by paying down the mortgage? Take 25 of it and throw it away as taxes assuming youre in the most common wageearner tax bracket. Thats 10895 in potential tax savings that you dont get over the life of the loan. If you penalize the \"payoffearly\" track by subtracting those extra taxes, you find that the breakeven APR on the annuity account is about 3.095."

    "topic": "Friend was brainwashed by MLMponzi investment scam. What can I do?",
    "content": "I will disagree with some of the other answers here. In my view, the most important dimension of the situation is not your friends potential loss but the potential losses of the people he may convince by using his position as youth group leader, etc., to draw more them into the scam. Exactly how to handle this depends on many factors that arent mentioned in your question and probably rightly so, as this aspect of the situation moves beyond personal finance. For instance, if your friend is a \"pillar of the community\" who is widely trusted, and you are not, there may be little you can do, since people will believe him and not you. If you have some influence over the groups he is trying to recruit, you can attempt to provide a counterweight to his recruitment activities. Again, how to do this depends on other factors, such as how he is recruiting them. If he is just privately contacting individuals and inviting them to these meetings, you may have to just keep your eyes peeled for anyone who seems tempted and try to dissuade them before they suffer the \"brainwashing\". If he actually tries to do some sort of public recruitment e.g., holding a meeting himself, you could try to inject doubt by, e.g., attending and asking probing questions to expose the dangers. If you think the danger is widespread, you could consider taking some more public action, like writing a column in a local paper about this organization. Of course, another major factor is how much you think people stand to lose by this. However, in your question you indicated that your friend has invested \"multiple month or years of income\". If he intends to pressure others to invest similar amounts, this sounds to me like enough danger to warrant some preventive action. Few people can afford to lose months or years of income, and sadly those most vulnerable to a scammers siren song are often those who can least afford it. It doesnt sound like a situation where youd have to devote your life to the cause of stopping it, but if I knew that dozens of people in my community stood to lose years of income, Id want to make at least a small effort to stop them, rather than just keep my mouth shut. In doing this, you may lose your friendship. However, you stated that your goal is to resolve the situation in a way that is \"best with lowest loss of money for everybody\". If you really take this utilitarian view, it is likely that you may have to give up on the friendship to prevent other people from losing more money."

Potential changes in rates  Could that 4 rate change at any time?

Some banks may advertise a special rate for a limited time to try to get more deposits and then change the rate later. Beware the fine print. Could the bond have some kind of extra feature on it?

    "content": "If you have no credit history but you have a job, buying an inexpensive used car should still be doable with only a marginally higher interest rate on the car. This can be offset with a cosigner, but it probably isnt that big of a deal if you purchase a car that you can pay off in under a year. The cost of insurance for a car is affected by your credit score in many locations, so regardless you should also consider selling your other car rather than maintaining and insuring it while its not your primary mode of transportation. The main thing to consider is that the terms of the credit will not be advantageous, so you should pay the full balance on any credit cards each month to not incur high interest expenses. A credit card through a credit union is advantageous because you can often negotiate a lower rate after youve established the credit with them for a while instead of closing the card and opening a new credit card account with a lower ratethis impacts your credit score negatively because the average age of open accounts is a significant part of the score. This advice is about the same except that it will take longer for negative marks like missed payments to be removed from your report, so expect 7 years to fully recover from the bad credit. Again, minimizing how long you have money borrowed for will be the biggest benefit. A note about cosigners we discourage people from cosigning on other peoples loans. It can turn out badly and hurt a relationship. If someone takes that risk and cosigns for you, make every payment on time and show them you appreciate what they have done for you."

    "content": "Ditto GradeEhBacon, but let me add a couple of comments But more relevantly GradeEhBacon mentioned transaction costs. Yes. Many tax shelters require setting up accounts, doing paperwork, etc. Often you have to get a lawyer or accountant to do this right. If the tax shelter could save you 1 million a year in taxes, it makes sense to pay a lawyer 10,000 to set it up right. If it could save you 100 a year in taxes, paying 10,000 to set it up would be foolish. In some cases the tax savings would be so small that it wouldnt be worth the investment of spending 20 on a FedEx package to ship the paperwork. Inconvenience. Arguably this is a special case of transaction costs the cost of your time. Suppose I knew that a certain tax shelter would save me 100 a year in taxes, but it would take me 20 hours a year to do the paperwork or whatever to manage it. I probably wouldnt bother, because my free time is worth more than 5 an hour to me. If the payoff was bigger or if I was poorer, I might be willing. Complexity. Perhaps a special case of 3. If the rules to manage the tax shelter are complicated, it may not be worth the trouble. You have to spend a bunch of time, and if you do it wrong, you may get audited and slapped with fines and penalties. Even if you do it right, a shelter might increase your chance of being audited, and thus create uncertainty and anxiety. Ive never intentionally cheated on my taxes, but every year when I do my taxes I worry, What if I make an honest mistake but the government decides that its attempted fraud and nails me to the wall? Qualification. Again, as others have noted, tax shelters arent generally, \"if you fill out this form and check box d you get 50 off on your taxes\". The shelters exist because the government decided that it would be unfair to impose taxes in this particular situation, or that giving a tax break encourages investment, or some other worthy goal. Sometimes that worthy goal is \"pay off my campaign contributors\", but thats another subject. The rules may have unintended loopholes, but any truly gaping ones tend to get plugged. So if, say, they say that you get a special tax break for investing in medical research, you cant just declare that your cigarette and whiskey purchases are medical research and claim the tax break. Or you talked about offshore tax havens. The idea here is that the US government cannot tax income earned in another country and that has never even entered the US. If you make 10 in France and deposit it in a French bank account and spend it in France, the US cant tax that. So American companies sometimes set up bank accounts outside the US to hold income earned outside the US, so they dont have to bring it into the US and pay the high US tax rate. US corporate taxes are now the highest of any industrialized country. You could, I suppose, open an account in the Caymans and deposit the income you earned from your US job there. But if the money was earned in the US, working at a factory or office in the US, by a person living in the US, the IRS is not going to accept that this is foreign income."

From Allys site What are eBills? An eBill is an online version of a bill or statement that can replace a traditional paper copy. Many large companies, like your electric, phone, cable and major credit card companies have the ability to send you eBills. To receive eBills at Ally, you must already receive your bill online at the billers website. Ally will ask for the billers website credentials to set up an eBill. Hope this helps."

    "topic": "How and why does the exchange rate of a currency change almost everyday?",
    "content": "The basic idea is that moneys worth is dependent on what it can be used to buy. The principal driver of monetary exchange using one type of currency to \"buy\" another is that usually, transactions for goods or services in a particular country must be made using that countrys official currency. So, if the U.S. has something very valuable lets say iPhones that people in other countries want to buy, they have to buy dollars and then use those dollars to buy the consumer electronics from sellers in the U.S. Each country has a \"basket\" of things they produce that another country will want, and a \"shopping list\" of things of value they want from that other country. The net difference in value between the basket and shopping list determines the relative demand for one currency over another the dollar might gain value relative to the Euro and thus a Euro will buy fewer dollars because Europeans want iPhones more than Americans want BMWs, or conversely the Euro can gain strength against the dollar because Americans want BMWs more than Europeans want iPhones. The fact that iPhones are actually made in China kind of plays into it, kind of not Apple pays the Chinese in Yuan to make them, then receives dollars from international buyers and ships the iPhones to them, making both the Yuan and the dollar more valuable than the Euro or other currencies. The total amount of a currency in circulation can also affect relative prices. Right now the American Fed is pumping billions of dollars a day into the U.S. economy. This means theres a lot of dollars floating around, so theyre easy to get and thus demand for them decreases. Its more complex than that for instance, the dollar is also used as the international standard for trade in oil you want oil, you pay for it in dollars, increasing demand for dollars even when the United States doesnt actually put any oil on the market to sell, but basically think of different currencies as having value in and of themselves, and that value is affected by how much the market wants that currency."

    "topic": "Basic mutual fund investment questions",
    "content": "JoeTaxpayer gave a great response to your first question. Here are some thoughts on the other two... 2 Transaction fees for mutual funds are tied to the class of shares youre buying and will be the same no matter where you buy them. Ashares have a frontend load the fee charged, and the lowest expenses, and can be liquidated without any fees. Bshares have no upfront load, but come with a 47 year period where they will charge you a fee to liquidate technically called Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, CDSC, and slightly higher management fees, after which they often will convert to Ashares. Cshares have the highest management fees, and usually a 12 to 18month period where they will charge a small percentage fee if you liquidate. There are lots of other share classes available, but they are tied to special accounts such as managed accounts and 401K plans. Not all companies offer all share classes. Cshares are intended for shorter timeframes, eg 25 years. A and B shares work best for longer times. Use a B share if youre sure you wont need to take the money out until after the fee period ends. Most fund companies will allow you to exchange funds within the same fund family without charging the CDSC. EDIT Noload funds dont charge a fee in or out usually. They are a great option if they are available to you. Most selfservice brokerages offer them. Few fullservice brokerages offer them. The advantage of a brokerage versus personal accounts at each fund is the brokerage gives you a single view of things and a single statement, and buying and selling is easy and convenient. 3 High turnover rates in bond funds... depending on how actively the portfolio is managed, the fund company may deliver returns as a mix of both interest and capital gains, and the management expenses may be high with a lot of churn in the underlying portfolio. Bond values fall as interest rates rise, so at least in the USA be prepared to see the share values of the fund fall in the next few years. The biggest risk of a bond fund is that there is no maturity date, so there is no point in time that you have an assurance that your original investment will be returned to you."

    "topic": "Why does my checkingsavings account offer a higher interest rate than a standalone savings account?",
    "content": "The key is that you need to use your debit card to earn the higher interest rate. The bank can offer a higher interest rate on accounts connected with a debit card because They earn additional income through debit card fees charged towards account holders, among other things. They offer the higher interest rate specifically to encourage people to use their debit cards. By offering a joint checkingsavings account that requires you to use your debit card, the bank is assuming that youll keep more money in your account than you would in a standard checkingonly account. Your higher balance translates into more money the bank can loan out or invest, which usually leads to higher profit for them. Businesses pay fees to the bank to accept debit cards. These fees represent another source of profit for the bank. The more you use your debit card, the more the bank earns in fees, so the bank encourages you to use your debit card more frequently through incentives like a higher interest rate or waiving fees on your account if you use your card enough. Plus, since its likely that an individual who maintains a fairly high balance in an account linked to a debit card is going to spend more simply because they can spend more, banks will sometimes waive fees on the consumer side for balances over a certain amount."

If the house deed is on both names, generally the Bank would insist the loan should also be on both of your names.

If one of you has bad credit, bank would raise the interest rate, assumption that bad credit would drag the good credit and force him to some activities  actions that could stretch the finance of one with good credit. If timely payments are not made, it would make your good credit to bad. If the house deed is on only on your name and you can get the loan on your own, this would be a better position. If the house deed is on only on your name and you would like to loan to be on both names, then the positive side is credit score of the person with bad credit would start showing improvement over period, provided both of you make timely payments. As pointed out by keshlam, there are enough question where people have entered into agreement without deciding what would happen if they separate. There is no right  wrong answer. It would be best you decide how it would be with respect to the ownership in the house and with respect to payments and if in worst case you part ways, how the settlement should look like."

    "content": "Some questions Will you need a car after 18 months? What are you going to do then? How likely are you able to go over the mileage? Granted paying 300 per month seems somewhat attractive as a fixed cost. However lease are notorious for forcing people into making bad decisions. If your car is over miles, or there is some slight damage even normal wear and tear, or you customize your car such as window tint the dealer can demand extra dollars or force you to purchase the car for more than it is actually worth. The bottom line is leasing is one of the most expensive ways to own a vehicle, and while you have a great income you have a poor net worth. So yes I would say it is somewhat irresponsible for you to own a vehicle. If I was in your shoes, I would cut my gym expenses, cut my retirement contributions to the match, and buy another used car. I understand you may have some burnout over your last car, but it is the best mathematical choice. Having said all that you have a great income and you can absorb a lot of less than efficient decisions. You will probably be okay leasing the car. I would suggest going for a longer term, or cutting something to pay off the student loans earlier. This way there is some cushion between when the lease ends and the student loan ends. This way, when lease turn in comes, you will have some room in your budget to pay some fees as you wont have your student loan payment assuming around 1400month that you can then pay to the dealer."

For example, you could buy a brand new Fiesta for 14,000 or a 6 month old version of the same car with a few thousand miles on the clock for 12,000. This means if you only have 12,000 then you can afford to buy a nearly new Fiesta, but if you can afford a bit more then Ford will happily take that off you for a brand new Fiesta.

    "content": "I speak from a position of experience, My BS and MS are both in Comp Sci. I know very little about loans or finances. That is very unfortunate as you are obviously an intelligent human being. Perhaps this is a good time to pause your formal education and get educated in personal finance. To me, it is that important. I study computer science, and am thus confident that I will be able to find work after I finish school. This kind of attitude can lead to trouble. You will likely have a high salary, but that does not always translate into prosperity. Personal finance is more about behavior then mathematics. I currently work with people that have high salaries in a low cost of living area. Some have lost homes due to foreclosure some are very limited in their options because of high student loan balances. Some are millionaires without hitting the IPOstartup lotto. The difference is behavior. Its possible that someone in my family will be able to cosign and help me out with this loan. This is indicative of lack of knowledge and poor financial behavior. This kind of thing can lead to strained relationships to the point where people dont talk to each other. Never cosign for anyone, and if you value the relationship with a person never ask them to cosign. Ill be working as a TA again for a 1000 stipend. Yikes! Why in the world would you work for 1K when you need 4K? You should find a way to earn 6K this semester so you can save some and put some toward the loans you already acquired. Accepting this kind of situation \"raises red flags\" on your attitude towards personal finance. And yes it is possible, you can earn that waiting tables and if you can find a part time programming gig you can make a lot more then that. Consider working as a TA and wait tables until you find that first programming gig. I am just about done with my undergraduate degree, and will be starting graduate school at the same university next semester. To me this is a recipe for failure in most cases. You have expended all your financing options to date and are planning to go backwards even more. Why not get out of school with your BS, and go to work? You can save up some of your MS tuition and most companies will provide tuition reimbursement. Computer ScienceSoftware Engineering can be a fickle market. Right now things are going crazy and times are really good. However that was not always the case during my career and unlikely for yours. For example, Just this year I bypassed my highest rate of pay that occurred in 2003. I was out of work most of 2004, and for part of 2005 I actually made less then when I was working while in college. In 2009 my company cut our salaries by 5, but the net cost to me was more like a 27 cut. In 2001 I worked as a contractor for a company that had a 10 reduction in full time employees, yet they kept us contractors working. Recently I talked with a recruiter about a position doing J2EE, which is what I am doing now. It required a high level security clearance which is not an easy thing to get. The rub was that it was located in a higher cost of living area and only paid about 70 of what I am making now. They required more and paid less, but such is the market. You need to learn about these things! Good luck."

    "topic": "What is the difference between good debt vs. bad debt?",
    "content": "First of all debt is a technology that allows borrower to bring forward their spending its a financial time machine. From borrowers point of view debt is good when it increases overall economic utility. A young person wants to bring up a family but cannot afford the house. Had they waited for 30 years they would have reached the level of income and savings to buy the house for cash. By the time it might be too late to raise a family, sure theyd enjoy the house for the last 20 years of their life. But they would loose 30 years of utility  they could have enjoyed the house for 50 years! So, for a reasonable fee, they can bring the spending forward. Another young person might want to enjoy a life of luxury, using the magical debt time machine and bringing forward their future earnings. They might spend 10 years worth of future earnings on entertainment within a year and have a blast. Due to the law of diminishing marginal utility  all that utility is pretty much wasted, but theyll still will need to make sacrifices in the future. The trick is to roughly match the period of debt repayment to the economic life of the purchase. Buying a house means paying over 30 years for an asset that has an economic life of 80 years, given that the interest fee is reasonable and the house wont loose its value overnight thats a good debt. Buying a used car with a remaining life of 5 years and financing its with a seven years loan  is not a good idea. Buying a luxurious holiday that lasts a fortnight with 2 years of repayments, i.e. financing nonessential short term need with medium term debt is insane. The other question is could the required utility be achieved through a substitute at a lower cost without having to bring the spending forward or paying the associated fee."

    "content": "On top of the given answers, the type of referral will also factor in. When youre up for renewal and go to a comparison site in the UK CompareTheMarket, MoneySupermarket, Confused, GoCompare, ...  and struggle accurately through all their lists of questions, you see that some of the data differs e.g., not all the same jobs can be entered if you have had an accident, not all ask whose fault it was andor dont leave the option \"not yet resolved\" possibly forcing you to guess which way it will be adjudicated, andor what the total repair cost was. So as these referrers feed slightly different data to roughly the same set of insurance providers, you will get slightly different quotes on the same providers. And expect your own provider to offer a slightly better quote than youll get in reality for renewing The referrers onetime cut has to be still taken off, but they count it as a new client so somebody gets a bonus for that  you they disregard as a captive client and give what boils down to a loyalty penalty. [Case in point I had an unresolved car accident, resolved months later in my favour. With all honest data including unresolved claim and its cost and putting my accidentfree years factor at 0 instead of 7, my old provider quoted about 8 more than the previous year on comparison sites but my renewal papers quoted me 290 more, upon telephone enquiry the promised to refund the difference if court found in my favour though they refused to give this in writing. So No thanks!] Then the other set of referrals they get is from you directly going to their website asking for a quote. They know what type of link youve followed banner, or google result, etc, they may know some info from your browsers cookies time spent where or other tracking service, and from your data they may guess how techsavvy and shopwise you are, and scale your offer accordingly. [Comparisonsite shoppers are lumped together at a relatively high savvylevel, of course!]. Companies breaking down your data and their own in a particular way can find advantages and hence offer you better terms, as said in the main answer this is like Arbitration in stock exchanges, ensuring a certain amount of sanity if theres something to exploit, somebody will, and everybody will follow. It may be that they find a certain group of people maybe more accidentprone but cheaper to deal with more flexible in repairtimes, or easy to bully in accepting sharedfault when they werent at fault, or they want a certain client for women, for civil servants, for sporty drivers, for homeowners  often for crossselling other insurance services. Or they claim to want pensioners because the company can offer them a familiar voice same account manager always contacting them while theyre easier to bamboozle and less likely to shop around when offered a rubbish deal. Also, 100 straight comparison of competing offers isnt possible as the fine details of the TCs terms  conditions would differ, as well as various little pinpricks in the claims handling process. And depreciation of a car, and various ways of dealing with it You insure it for the buying prices, but two years later its worth about 40 less on paper  so in case of total loss, replacing likeforlike will cost you still at least 80 of the value for which youve been insuring it while theyll probably offer you the 10040 60. Mostly because instead of your trusted car you have something unknown that may have hidden defects, or been mistreated and about to die. [Case in point My 3yold dealerbought cars gearbox died just outside the 6month warranty period, notwithstanding its \"150item inspection you can rely on\". In the end the national brand agreed to refund the parts 15 of what I paid for the car but not the labour a few hours.] And any car models value differs in descending order from its \"forecourt price\", \"private selling price\", \"part exchange price\", and \"auction price\". Depending on your ompanies may happily insure you for forecourt price what you paid to dealer but then point out that the value of that car is the theoretical PX value, i.e., the car without anybodys profit, far less than youve been paying for. [Conversely, if you crash it after insuring below market value, they can pay you your stupidly low figure.]"

    "topic": "How do I know if refinance is beneficial enough to me?",
    "content": "It would help if we had numbers to walk you through the analysis. Current balance, rate, remaining term, and the new mortgage details. To echo and elaborate on part of Bens response, the most important thing is to not confuse cash flow with savings. If you have 15 years to go, and refinance to 30 years, at the rate rate, your payment drops by 13. Yet your rate is identical in this example. The correct method is to take the new rate, plug it into a mortgage calculator or spreadsheet using the remaining months on the current mortgage, and see the change in payment. This savings is what you should divide into closing costs to calculate the breakeven. Its up to you whether to adjust your payments to keep the term the same after you close. With respect to keshlam, rules of thumb often fail. There are mortgages that build the closing costs into the rate. Not the amount loaned, the rate. This means that as rates dropped, moving from 5.25 to 5 made sense even though with closing costs there were 4.5 mortgages out there. Because rates were still falling, and I finally moved to a 3.5 loan. At the time I was serial refinancing, the bank said I could return to them after a year if rates were still lower. In my opinion, we are at a bottom, and the biggest question you need to answer is whether youll remain in the house past your own breakeven time. Last  with personal finance focusing on personal, the analysis shouldnt ignore the rest of your balance sheet. Say you are paying 1500mo with 15 years to go. Your budget is tight enough that youve chosen not to deposit to your 401k. assuming you are in the US or country with pretax retirement account options In this case, holding rates constant, a shift to 30 years frees up about 500mo. In a matched 401k, your 6000yr is doubled to 12Kyear. Of course, if the money would just go in the market unmatched, members here would correctly admonish me for suggesting a dangerous game, in effect borrowing via mortgage to invest in the market. The matched funds, however are tough to argue against."

Trading the foreign stock at a local exchange may mean that the transaction volume is far lower than at their \"home\" exchange. Holding stock of companies working in foreign markets OTOH can be seen as diversification and may lower your risk. If you only invest in the local market, your investments may be subject to the same economic fluctuations that your wageemploymentpension situation is subject to  it may be good to try decorrelating this a bit.

If you havent maxed out your 401k yet, and it has matching funds, that is usually the place to start saving for retirement otherwise you are leaving free money on the table."

    "content": "In the U.S. it is typical that a stock brokerage account can be set up to buy stock with up to half the cost being borrowed from the broker. This is called a margin account. The stock purchased must remain in the account until sold or the loan is paid off, as it serves as builtin collateral for the loan. If the market price for the stock goes down too much, you will be required to add money, or the stock will be sold to cover the loan. See this question for some more information."

The reason for the difference in payouts comes from the fact that the manager of the levered ETF promises you a multiple of the daily returns of the underlying. To be able to promise you these daily returns, the ETF manager has to buysell some of the underlying every day to position himself to have a constant leverage ratio the next day. The short video below explains this process in detail for a 2x long ETF, but the same result holds for a 2x short ETF the manager has to buy more of the underlying on a day when the underlying increases in value and sell more of the underlying when the underlying goes down in value ."

I dont want to repeat the content of hundreds of recommendations here, so just the nutshell For qualified investments, the more risk you are willing to take, the more returns youll get. The upper end is the mutual funds and share market, where you have longterm expectations of 8  10  and corresponding risks of maybe  50 per year, the lower end is a CD, where you can expect little to no interest, corresponding to little to no risk. Investing in sharesfunds is not better than investing in CDs, it is different. Not everybody likes financial rollercoasters, and some people mainly consider the high risk, which gives them sleepless nights while others just consider the expected high longterm gains as all that counts.

Your income and saving is good and you have two clearly defined goals of retirement saving and saving for a house each with very different time frames 30 years and 35 years respectively. For medium term money, like saving for a house, just building up cash is not actually a bad idea. This minimizes the chance that a market crash will happen at the same time you need to withdraw the money. However, given you have the means to take more risk a generally smarter scheme would be to invest much of the money in a broad liquid bond funds with a somewhat lower percentage in stocks and then reduce the amount of stock each year as you get closer even moving some into cash. This gives reasonable positive expected return while lowering the risk of having to sell during a crisis as the time to purchase gets shorter and shorter. The retirement money should be invested for the long term as usual. A majority in lowfee index stock fundsetfs is the standard advice for good reason."

There were no Roth 401K accounts, but contributions could be pretax or posttax. Long term employees were matched 100 up to 8, newer employees were only matched 50 up to 8 resulting in 4 match. Every quarter this employee put in 8, and then pulled out the previous quarters contribution. The company match continued to grow. Was it smart? He still ended up with 8 going into the 401K. In those preEnron days the law allowed companies to limit the company match to 100 company stock which meant that employees retirement was at risk. Of course by the early 2000s the stock that was purchased for 6 a share was worth 80 a share... Now what about the IRS Since I make designated Roth contributions from aftertax income, can I make taxfree withdrawals from my designated Roth account at any time? No, the same restrictions on withdrawals that apply to pretax elective contributions also apply to designated Roth contributions. If your plan permits distributions from accounts because of hardship, you may choose to receive a hardship distribution from your designated Roth account. The hardship distribution will consist of a prorata share of earnings and basis and the earnings portion will be included in gross income unless you have had the designated Roth account for 5 years and are either disabled or over age 59 . Regarding getting just contributions What happens if I take a distribution from my designated Roth account before the end of the 5taxableyear period? If you take a distribution from your designated Roth account before the end of the 5taxableyear period, it is a nonqualified distribution. You must include the earnings portion of the nonqualified distribution in gross income. However, the basis or contributions portion of the nonqualified distribution is not included in gross income. The basis portion of the distribution is determined by multiplying the amount of the nonqualified distribution by the ratio of designated Roth contributions to the total designated Roth account balance. For example, if a nonqualified distribution of 5,000 is made from your designated Roth account when the account consists of 9,400 of designated Roth contributions and 600 of earnings, the distribution consists of 4,700 of designated Roth contributions that are not includible in your gross income and 300 of earnings that are includible in your gross income. See QAs regarding Rollovers of Designated Roth Contributions, for additional rules for rolling over both qualified and nonqualified distributions from designated Roth accounts."

    "topic": "How often do typical investors really lose money?",
    "content": "How often do investors really lose money? All the time. And its almost always reason number 1. Lets start with the beginner investor, the person most likely to make some real losses and feel theyve \"learned\" that investing is no better than Vegas. This person typically gets into it because theyve been given a hot stock tip, or because theyve received a windfall, decided to give this investing lark a try, and bought stock in half a dozen companies whose names they know from their everyday lives \"I own a bit of Google! How cool is that?\". These are people who dont understand the cyclic nature of the market bear gives way to bull gives way to bear, and on and on, and so when they suddenly see that what was 1000 is now 900 they panic and sell everything. Especially as all the pundits are declaring the end of the world they always do. Until the moment they sold, they only had paper losses. But they crystallised those losses, made them real, and ended at a loss. Then theres the trendfollower. These are people who dont necessarily hit a bear market, or even a downturn, in their early days, but never really try to learn how the market works in any real sense. They jump into every hot stock, then panic and sell out of anything that starts to go the wrong way. Both of these reactive behaviours seem reasonable in the moment \"Its gone up 15 in the past week? Buy buy buy!\" and \"Ive lost 10 this month on that thing? Get rid of it before I lose any more!\", but they work out over time to lots of buying high and selling low, the very opposite of what you want to do. Then theres the daytrader. These are people who sit in their home office, buying and selling all day to try and make lots of little gains that add up to a lot. The reason these people dont do well in the long run is slightly different to the other examples. First, fees. Yes, most platforms offer a discount for \"frequent traders\", but it still aint free. Second, theyre peewees playing in the big leagues. Of course there are exceptions who make out like bandits, but day traders are playing a different game than the people Id call investors. That game, unlike buyandhold investing, is much more like gambling, and daytraders are the enthusiastic amateurs sitting down at a table with professional poker players  institutional investors and the computers and research departments that work for them. Even buyandhold investors, even the more sophisticated ones, can easily realise losses on a given stock. You say you should just hold on to a stock until it goes back up, but if it goes low enough, it could take a decade or more to even just break even again. More savvy stockpickers will have a system worked out, something like \"ok, if it gets down to 90 of what I bought it for, I cut my losses and sell.\" This is actually a sensible precaution, because defining hard rules like that helps you eliminate emotion from your investing, which is incredibly important if you want to avoid becoming the trendfollower above. Its still a loss, but its a calculated one, and hopefully over time the exception rather than the rule. There are probably as many other ways to lose money as there are people investing, but I think Ive given you a taste. The key to avoiding such things is understanding the psychology of investing, and defining the rules that youll follow no matter what as in that last example. Or just go learn about index investing. Thats what I did."

Due to the excellent healthcare and welfare system in Germany, this is not as important as in many other countries. But knowing that you have a few thousand  laying around in liquid assets in case something expensive breaks down can really help you sleep at night. If you decide not to pay for contents insurance, calculate what it would cost you if there is a fire in your apartment and you would have to replace everything. Thats how large your emergency fund needs to be. You also need a larger emergency fund if you are a homeowner, because as a homeowner there might always be an emergency repair you have to pay for. Priority 3 Retirement. Unless there will be some serious retirement reforms in the next 40 years and I would not bet on that!, the governmentprovided pension will not be enough to cover your lifestyle cost. If you dont want to suffer from poverty as a senior citizen you will have to build up a retirement plan now. Check which options your company provides \"Betriebliche Altersvorsorge\" and what retirement options you have which give you free money from the government \"RiesterRente\". Getting professional advise to compare all the options with each other can be really beneficial. Priority 4 Save for a home. In the longrun, owning a home is much cheaper than renting one. Paying of a mortgage is just like paying rent  but with the difference that the money you pay every month isnt spent. Most of it minus interest and building maintenance costs stays your capital! At one point you will have paid it off and then you never have to pay rent in your life. It even secures the financial future of your children and grandchildren, who will inherit your home. But few banks will give you a good interest rate if you have no own capital at all. So you should start saving money now. Invest a few hundred  every month in a longterm portfolio.

As you can see in this graph of historical CD yields, it hasnt always been the case that CDs offered such small returns. That being said, CDs are safe investments, being FDIC insured up to the FDIC insurance limits, so youre not going to get great rates from one, because theres basically no risk in this particular type of investment.

The same is true of iPads, iPods, Apple watches, etc. Because of the sales of products and services, Apple is now a huge company with a huge net worth. Obviously, your 110,000,000th share of the company is now worth a lot more. Perhaps it is worth 399. Maybe you think Apples good days are behind it. After all, it is harder to grow a huge company 15 a year than it is a small company. So maybe you will go into the marketplace and offer to sell your 110,000,000th share of Apple. If someone offers you 399, would you take it? The value of stocks in the market is not a Ponzi scheme, although it is a bit speculative. You might have a different conclusion and different research about the future value of Apple than I do. Your research might lead you to believe the stock is worth 399. Mine might suggest its worth 375. Then I wouldnt buy. The value of stocks in the market is based on the present and estimated future value of living, breathing companies that are growing, shrinking and steady.

However, there are a couple of general things to keep in mind about gold that should be largely independent of country. First, gold is not an investment. Aside from a few industrial uses, it has no productive value. It is, at best, a hedge against inflation, since many people feel more comfortable with what they consider \"real\" money that is not subject to what seems to be arbitrary creation by central banks. Second, buying tiny amounts of gold as coin or bullion from a retail dealer will always involve a fairly significant spread from the commodity spot price. The spot price only applies to large transactions. Retail dealers have costs of doing business that necessitate these fees in order for them to make a profit. You must also consider the costs of storing your gold in a way that mitigates the risk of theft. The comment by NL7 is on this point. It appeared while I was typing this answer. You might find this Planet Money piece instructive on the process, costs, and risks of buying gold bullion in the US. If you feel that you must own gold as an inflation hedge, and it is possible for residents of India, you would be best off with some kind of gold fund that tracks the price of bullion."

But at the same time, if it starts to rise, you will already have your pig in the race. Example Suppose you wanted to invest 300 in a company. We will do so over 3 periods. As the price falls, your average dollar cost will as well. But since you dont know where the bottom is, you cannot wait until the bottom.

    "topic": "Why the SP futures prices are not reflecting the general bullish sentiment of the US stock market",
    "content": "This is a great question for understanding how futures work, first lets start with your assumptions The most interesting thing here is that neither of these things really matters for the price of the futures. This may seem odd as a futures contract sounds like you are betting on the future price of the index, but remember that the current price already includes the expectations of future earnings as well! There is actually a fairly simple formula for the price of a futures contract note the link is for forward contracts which are very similar but slightly more simple to understand. Note, that if you are given the current price of the underlying the futures price depends essentially only on the interest rate and the dividends paid during the length of the futures contract. In this case the dividend rate for the SP500 is higher than the prevailing interest rate so the futures price is lower than the current price. It is slightly more complicated than this as you can see from the formula, but that is essentially how it works. Note, this is why people use futures contracts to mimic other exposures. As the price of the future moves pretty much in lockstep with the underlying and sometimes using futures to hedge exposures can be cheaper than buying etfs or using swaps. Edit Example of the effect of dividends on futures prices For simplicity, lets imagine we are looking at a futures position on a stock that has only one dividend D in the near term and that this dividend happens to be scheduled for the day before the futures delivery date. To make it even more simple lets say the price of the stock is fairly constant around a price P and interest rates are near zero. After the dividend, we would expect the price of the stock to be P  P  D as if you buy the stock after the dividend you wouldnt get that dividend but you still expect to get the rest of the value from additional future cash flows of the company. However, if we buy the futures contract we will eventually own the stock but only after the dividend happens. Since we dont get that dividend cash that the owners of the stock will get we certainly wouldnt want to pay as much as we would pay for the stock P. We should instead pay about P the expected value of owning the stock after that date. So, in the end, we expect the stock price in the future P to be the futures price today P and that should make us feel a lot more comfortable about what we our buying. Neither owning the stock or future is really necessarily favorable in the end you are just buying slightly different future expected cash flows and should expect to pay slightly different prices."

    "topic": "How do you quantify investment risk?",
    "content": "Another approach would be more personalized, which is to measure the risk of missing your goals, rather than measuring the risk of an investment in some abstract sense. Financial planners do this for example with Monte Carlo simulation software see httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMonteCarlomethod. They would put in a goal such as not running out of money before you die, with assumptions such as the longest you might live and how much youll withdraw every year. Youd also assume an asset allocation. The Monte Carlo simulation then generates random market movements over the time period, considering historical behavior of your asset allocation, and each run of the simulation would either succeed you are able to support yourself until death or fail you run out of money. The risk measure is the percentage of simulation runs that fail. You can do this to plan saving for retirement in addition to planning withdrawals then your goal would be to have X amount of money in real afterinflation dollars, perhaps, and success is if you end up with it, and failure is if you dont. The great thing about this risk measure is that its relevant and personal \"10 chance of being impoverished at age 85,\" \"20 chance of having to work an extra decade because you dont have enough at 65,\" these kinds of answers. Which is a lot easier to act on than \"the variance is 10\" or \"the beta is 1.5\"  would you rather know your plan has a 90 chance of success, or know that you have a variance of 10? Both numbers are probably just guesses, but at least the \"chance of success\" measure is actionable and relevant. Some tangential thoughts FWIW"

    "content": "As Dheer has already told you in his answer, your plan is perfectly legal, and there are no US tax issues other than making sure that you report all the interest that you earn in all your NRE accounts not just this one as well as all your NRO accounts, stock and mutual fund dividends and capital gains, rental income, etc to the IRS and pay appropriate taxes. You do get a credit from the IRS for taxes paid to India on NRO account income etc You also may also need to report the existence of accounts if the balance exceeds 10K at any time etc. But, in addition to the foreign exchange conversion risk that Dheer has pointed out to you, have you given any thought to what is going to happen with that credit card? That 0 interest balance of 5K does not mean an interestfree loan 0f 5K for a year with 150 service charge on that transaction. Instead, consider the following. If you use the card for any purchases, then after the first month, your purchases will be charged interest from the day that you make them till the day they are paid off there is no 25day grace period. The only way to avoid this is to pay off the full balance 5K 0 interest loan PLUS 150 service charge as well as any other service charges, annual fees etc PLUS all purchases PLUS any interest shown on the first monthly statement that you receive after taking that loan. If you choose this option, then, in effect, have taken a 5K loan for only about 55 days and have paid 3 interest sorry, I meant to write service fee for the privilege. If you dont use the card for any purchases at all, then the first monthly statement will show a statement balance of 5130 and most likely a minimum required payment of 200. By law, the minimum required payment is all interest charged for that month0 PLUS all service fees charged during that month 150 PLUS 1 of the rest 50. Well, actually the law says something like \"a sufficient fraction of the balance to ensure that a person making the required minimum payment each month can pay off the debt in a reasonable time\" and most credit card companies choose 1 as the sufficient fraction and 108 months as a reasonable time. OK, so you pay the 200 and feel that you have paid off the service fee and 50 of that 0 interest loan. Not so! If you make the required minimum payment, the law allows that amount to be be applied to any part of the balance owing. It is only the excess over the minimum payment that the law says must be applied to the balance being charged the highest rate. So, you have paid off 200 of that 5K loan and still owe the service fee. The following months statement will include interest on that unpaid 150. In short, to leave only the 0 balance owing, you have to pay 350 that first month so that next months statement balance will be 4800 at 0. The next months required minimum payment will be 48, and so on. In short, you really need to keep on top of things and understand how creditcard payments really work in order to pull off your scheme successfully. Note also that the remaining part of that 0 interest balance must be paid off by the end of the period or else a humongous rate of interest will be applied retroactively from Day One, more than enough to blow away all that FD interest. So make sure that you have the cash handy to pay it off in timely fashion when it comes due."

If house A costs 1M and youll make 50K profit from it yearly, and house B costs 1.33M and youll make 65K profit from it yearly, then you can compute cap rates to see that A is a more efficient investment from the point of view of income vs. amountofmoneyyouhavestuckinthisinvestmentandunavailableforuseelsewhere. Profit margin, on the other hand, cares more about your ongoing expenses than about your total investment. If it costs less to maintain property B than it does to maintain property A, then you could have something like So B is a more efficient investment from the point of view of the fraction of your revenue you actually get to keep each year. Certainly you could think of the propertys value as an opportunity cost and factor that into the net profit margin equation to get a more robust estimate of exactly how efficient your investment is. You can keep piling more factors into the equation until youve accounted for every possible facet of your investment. This is what accountants and economists spend their days doing. "

Maybe a couple few point for a little while. In your daily activities, it is inconsequential. If you are prepping to get a mortgage, you should be mindful. Similar type hard pulls in a certain time window will only count once, because it is assume you are shopping. For example, mortgage shopping will result in a lot of hard pulls, but if they are all done in a fortnight, they only count against once. I believe the time window is actually a month, but I have always had two weeks in my head as the safe window. The reason soft pulls dont matter is because businesses typically wont make credit decisions based on them. A soft pull is so a business can find a list of people to make offers to, but that doesnt mean they ACTUALLY qualify. Only the information in a hard pull will tell them that. I dont know, but I suspect it is more along the lines of \"give me everybody who is between 600 and 800 and lives in zip code 12344\" not \"what is series0nes credit score?\" A hard pull will lower your score because of a scenario where you open up many many lines of credit in a short period of time. The credit scoring models assume I am guessing that you are going to implode. You are either attempting to cover obligations you cant handle, or you are about to create a bunch of obligations you cant handle. Credit should be used as a convenient method of payment, not a source of wealth. As such, each credit line you open in a short time lowers the score. You are disincentivized to continue opening lines, and lenders at the end of your credit line opening spree will see you as riskier than the first."

Youll be able to review the HOA financials to see where the money goes and if they have healthy reserves. Youll see how much they spend on administration, I think 10 is typical, and administration can be offset by the savings associated with doing everything in bulk. A wellrun HOA should actually save you money over paying for all the things separately, but many people are happy to do some things themselves rather than pay for it, and would come out ahead if they didnt have an HOA. And of course, not all HOAs are wellrun. Just do your best to get informed Transitioning to Rental If you are interested in trying your hand being a landlord after living there for a while, a townhouse typically exposes you to less rental risk than a singlefamily home, because the cost is typically lower and if the HOA maintains everything outside the house then you dont have to worry as much about tenants keeping a lawn in good shape, for example. Appreciation Appreciation varies wildly by market, some research by Trulia suggests in general condos have outperformed singlefamily houses over the last 5 years by 10.5. The same article notes that others disagree with Trulias assessment and put condos below singlefamily houses by 1.3 annually. My first townhouse has appreciated 41 over the last 3 years, while houses in the area are closer to 30 over the same period, but I believe thats a function of my local market more than a nationwide trend. I wouldnt plan around any appreciation forecasts. Source Condos may be appreciating faster than singlefamily houses My adviceYou have to do your research on each potential property regardless of whether its a condotownhousesinglefamily to find out what restrictions there are and what services are provided by the HOA if any, your agent should be provided with most of the pertinent info, and you may not get to see HOA financials until youre under contract.

Interest accrues during the construction, but no payments need to be made until the constructionrepairs are complete. Private money works in a similar manner, but the full amount can be released to you at once so you can get the repairs done more quickly. The interest rate will be higher. If you are flipping, then this higher interest rate is simply a cost of doing business. Since its a private loan, you ca structure the deal any way you want. Perhaps accruing interest until the property is sold and then paying it back as a single balloon payment on sale of the property. To find private money, contact a mortgage broker and tell them what you have in mind. If youre intending to keep the property for yourself, private money is still an option.

    "content": "The biggest red flag is the fact that your parents may lose their house. There are multiple parts of the decision. The red flag comes in because you are stretching your finances to the max to afford the house you are interested in. Buying down the interest rate makes some sense depending on how long you plan on staying, but not a a way to afford house X. Of course a bigger down payment will also influence the size of the house. You are also buying something in case your parents need a place to live. What happens if that never occurs? You now have something bigger than you need. You are mixing investments and housing. There is no guarantee that you will even breakeven on the house as a investment. It can take several years to make back the closing costs involved in buying and selling a house, based solely on stable price and your monthly payments. If the price drops you might never make the money back. You might be better off renting what you need now or waiting until the current house is lost and then renting what you need then."

    "content": "CFDs Contracts for Difference are basically a contract between you and the broker on the difference in price of the underlying between the time you open a position and close a position. You are not actually buying the underlying. With share CFDs, the outcome is a bit like buying the underlying shares on margin. You pay interest for every day you hold the CFDs overnight for long CFDs. However, with short positions, you get paid interest for every day you hold your short position overnight. Most people use CFDs for short term trading, however they can be used for medium to longer term trading just as you would hold a portfolio on margin. What you have to remember is that because you are buying on margin you can lose more than your initial contract amount. A way to manage this risk is by using position sizing and stop loses. With your position sizing, if you wanted to invest 10,000 in a particular share trading at 10 per share, you would then buy 1000 shares or 1000 CFDs in that share. Your initial expense with the CFDs might be only 1000 at a margin rate of 10. So instead of increasing your risk by having an initial outlay of 10,000 with the CFDs you limit your risk to the same as you were buying the shares directly."

Ask anybody whos refinanced their house to buy a new boat or SUV in 20062007. In other words youre remortgaging the chickens before the eggs hatched. Of course theyre also forgetting that all this debt will have to be paid back at some point, and that usually takes income, not equity. In a certain sense the housing market is a pyramid scheme that requires an influx of new buyers to maintain prices. Very simply, if you cant sell your house to buy a bigger one because the first time buyer youre trying to sell it to cant afford the down payment or the payment on the mortgage, then you cant sell your house to buy a biggerbetternicer one and the next person in the chain cant sell hishers. Cue the domino effect. House prices are only sustainable if people actually can afford to buy houses and if theres a massive disconnect between house prices and salaries, then house prices will fall eventually. It might just take a little longer depending on the amount of creative financing options that will eventually dry up."

So if my initial investment was 4000 200  20 and I bought it at 3800 200  19 I profit from the difference, which is 200. Do I also receive back the extra 2000 I gave the bank to perform the trade? Either this is extremely poorly worded or you misunderstand the mechanics of a short position. When you open a short position, your are expecting that the stock will decline from here. In a short position you are borrowing shares you dont own and selling them. If the price goes down you get to buy the same shares back for less money and return them to the person you borrowed from. Your profit is the delta between the original sell price and the new lower buy price less commissions and feesinterest. Opening and closing a short position is two trades, a sell then a buy. Just like a long trade there is no maximum holding period. If you place your order to sell short 200 shares at 19, your initial investment is 3,800. In order to open your 3,800 short position your broker may require your account to have at least 5,700 according to the 1.5 ratio in your question. Its not advisable to open a short position this close to the ratio requirement. Most brokers require a buffer in your account in case the stock goes up, because in a short trade if the stock goes up youre losing money. If the stock goes up such that youve exhausted your buffer youll receive whats known as a \"margin call\" where your broker either requires you to wire in more money or sell part or all of your position at a loss to avoid further losses. And remember, you may be charged interest on the value of the shares youre borrowing. When you hold a position long your maximum loss is the money you put in a position can only fall to zero though you may owe interest or other fees if youre trading on margin. When you hold a position short your maximum loss is unlimited theres no limit to how high the value of something can go. There are less risky ways to make short trades by using put options, but you should ensure that you have a firm grasp on whats happening before you use real money. The timing of the trades and execution of the trades is no different than when you take a plain vanilla long position. You place your order, either market or limit or whatever, and it executes when your trade criteria occurs."

They have the same fiduciary duties as an independent AM and are probably using the brokerdealer services of other banks as well as their parent. Reputation is a key issue for banks and conflict of interests are usually managed properly. Independence also comes and goes. The corporate history of Neuberger Berman is a good example. Neuberger Berman was once an independent asset manager. In 2003, it merged with Lehman Brothers, thus loosing its independence. When Lehman went bankrupt in 2008, NB did not join its parent company in bankruptcy and did not lose the assets of its clients. The company continued to operate until it was acquired by the management. Finally it is mostly a question of marketing and positioning."

I would qualify the CAPM as quantitative analysis because its mathematics and statistics. Its not really fundamental since its does not relies on economical data except the prices. And as for technical analysis, the term is often used as a synonym for graphical analysis or chartism, but quantitative analysis can also be referred as technical analysis. the present value of future cash flows [...] called intrinsic pricevalue, if I am correct? Yes you are correct. I wonder when deciding whether an asset is overfairundervalued, ususally what kind of price is compared to what other kind of price? If its only to compare with the price, usually, the Net asset value which is the book value, the Discount Cash flows the intrinsic value and the price of comparable companies and the CAPM are used in comparison to current market price of the asset that you are studying. Why is it in the quote to compare the first two kinds of prices, instead of comparing the current real price on the markets to any of the other three kinds? Actually the last line of the quote says that the comparison is done on the observed price which is the market price the other prices cant really be observed. But, think that the part an asset is correctly priced when its estimated price is the same as the present value of future cash flows of the asset means that, since the CAPM gives you an expected rate of return, by using this rate to compute the present value of future cash flows of the asset, you should have the same predicted price.

If you then provide a cashiers check for the payment, your expartner will not really have anything to complain about. If youre worried about annoying him by doing this, thats a separate issue, but given the situation you describe, I dont see why you should be. If you feel he is being a pain in the neck, feel free to be a pain in the neck right back and force him to accept the payment in the manner you decide, instead of allowing him to string you along.

    "content": "If the interest rate on the student loan is lower than inflation, then the student loan will be \"cheaper\" the longer you take to pay it. This is now a very rare instance, but there were programs and loan consolidation opportunities in the mid200xs that allowed savvy students to convert their loans to have an interest rate of around 1.5. Right now the inflation rate is actually quite low, but its not expected to stay there, and wasnt that low just a few years ago, so in the long run this type of debt will only be cheaper the longer it takes to pay off. It is risky, as others point out, as it cant be written off in bankruptcy, but there are other situations where it can be written off more easily than other debts, so on balance the risks arent better or worse than other loans in general. For specific individual situations the risk equation might work out differently, though. Further, student loans arent considered traditional debt by some lenders for specific lending opportunities, thus allowing you to go into greater debt for certain types of purchases. Whether this is good for you or not depends on the importance of the purchase. If you need to buy a house and the interest rate is higher than your student loan rate, it will be better, financially, to pay off the house first, while paying the minimum on the student loans. If you have no other debt with a higher interest, and the student loan interest is higher than inflation, there is no reason to delay paying off the student loan."

If your credit is good and you are using your other cards responsibly, closing the card given the annual fee would not cause me great concern if it were me. Since you are so much better of a risk than you likely were in college, you can also call Capital One, ask to speak with a supervisor, and ask them to drop the fee and increase your credit limit. They should be able to easily verify that you meet the requirements for other types of preferred cards they offer, and they should be willing to offer you improved terms rather than losing your business. It is very possible they simply havent reevaluated your risk since you initially applied. Also, remember that these types of effects determine only a portion of your overall score. Activity is also a major component. Rather than leaving an unused card open for history and debttolimit purposes only, I would also recommend having some minimum level of activity, such as an automatic bill payment, on each card you carry.

You make it sound like the crisis was a total random event, that you did nothing to cause it. Financial crises are rarely without fault. Common causes are failure to understand risk, borrowing too much, insuring too little, improper maintenance, improper reserves, improper planning, etc... Taking a good step or two back and really understanding the cause of your financial crisis and how it could be avoided in the future is very useful. Talk to someone who is actually wealthy about how you could have behaved differently to avoid the \"crisis\". There are some small set of crises that are no fault of your own. However in those cases the recipe to recovery is patience. Attempting to recover in 12 days is a recipe for further disaster. Your willingness to consider borrowing at 44 suggests this crisis was selfinflicted. It also indicates you need a whole lot more education in personal finance. This is reinforced by your insatiable desire for a high credit score. Credit score is no indication of wealth, and is meaningless until you desire to borrow money. From what I read, you should not be borrowing money. When the time comes for you to buy a home with a mortgage, its fairly easy to have a high enough credit score to borrow at a good rate. You get there by paying your bills on time and having a sufficient deposit. Dont chase a high credit score at the expense of building real wealth."

    "content": "You have a few options and sometimes challenges help us improve our situation. First, you can not borrow to buy a car. Reducing the massive depreciation that cars undergo will help you be wealthier. It is hard to find a good use car that you can buy for cash, but it will play out best for your finances in the long run. If your heart is set on borrowing, I would encourage you to go to the bankcredit union where you have your checking account. They will see your history of deposits and may grant you a loan based on that. Also you are likely to get a better deal from the bank than from the car dealer. Thirdly, you can simply go to your employers HR department and ask them. Surely someone has applied for a loan during the companys history. What did they do for them?"

    "content": "No, but it is certainly a possibility. the efficient market hypothesis would say that this means that the market perceives the present value of all future earning as negative. These earnings might take the form of a writedown of assets at some point. Companies carry a goodwill asset that is generally imaginary. They book that asset when they buy companies for more than they are worth. It would be as if PRUN was a stock tracking my life. If I bought my house in 2006 for 1 million cash. I might have a book value of 1 million. However, PRUN might trade at 500k because the market knows that my asset isnt really worth 1 million and at some point my earnings will take a hit to reflect that. It might also mean that future \"real\" earnings \"ie actual profit and loss on sales\" are going to be negative. This would mean bankruptcy is more likely."

    "topic": "Are there any investment strategies which take advantage of an inthemoney option price that incorporates no time value?",
    "content": "Options can have a negligible time premium. For American1 calls the time premium is never negative. If it had a negative premium it would be profitable to exercise it immediately. A deep in the money call has a delta of exactly one. That is, its price movements completely mirror the price movements of the underlying stock. That means an option seller can buy stock and completely hedge his short option position. The seller of the option may be in an position to buy with very little margin and take your money and invest it. For example, consider a stock trading at 7.50, with its January 2014 4 call option trading at 3.50. For one option, representing 100 shares, a trader could take your 350 dollars and invest it, and only use a small portion of the money to buy the stock on margin. Marketmakers can typically borrow money at very low interest rates. If you have high borrowing costs, or are unable to buy on margin, then buying deep in the money calls can be a good strategy. Long story short, option sellers are making money off selling these deep in the money calls even with almost zero time premium. So, in general, theres no way to make money by buying them. 1. An American call is a call that can be exercised at any time up to and including its expiration date."

    "topic": "What determines the price of fixed income ETFs?",
    "content": "The literal answer to your question what determines the price of an ETF is the market it is whatever price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept. But if the market price of an ETF share deviates significantly from its NAV, the pershare market value of the securities in its portfolio, then an Authorized Participant can make an arbitrage profit by a transaction creation or redemption that pushes the market price toward NAV. Thus as long as the markets are operating and the APs dont vanish in a puff of smoke we can expect price will track NAV. That reduces your question to why does NAV  market value of the holdings underlying a bond ETF share decrease when the market interest rate rises? Lets consider an example. Ill use US Treasuries because they have very active markets, are treated as riskfree although that can be debated, and excluding special cases like TIPS and strips are almost perfectly fungible. And I use round numbers for convenience. Lets assume the current market interest rate is 2 and Spindoctor 10year Treasury Fund opens for business with 100m invested via APs in 10year Tnotes with 2 coupon at par and 1m shares issued that are worth 100 each. Now assume the interest rate goes up to 3 this is an example NOT A PREDICTION no one wants to pay par for a 2 bond when they can get 3 elsewhere, so its value goes down to about 0.9 of par not exactly due to the way the arithmetic works but close enough and Spindoctor shares similarly slide to 90. At this price an investor gets slightly over 2 couponfacebasis plus approximately 1 amortized capital gain slightly less due to time value per year so its competitive with a 3 coupon at par. As you say new bonds are available that pay 3. But our fund doesnt hold them we hold old bonds with a face value of 100m but a market value of only 90m. If we sell those bonds now and buy 3 bonds to try to replace them, we only get 90m par value of 3 bonds, so now our fund is paying a competitive 3 but NAV is still only 90. At the other extreme, say we hold the 2 bonds to maturity, paying out only 2 interest but letting our NAV increase as the remaining term duration and thus discount of the bonds decreases  assuming the market interest rate doesnt change again, which for 10 years is probably unrealistic ignoring 20092016!. At the end of 10 years the 2 bonds are redeemed at par and our NAV is back to 100  but from the investors point of view theyve forgone 10 in interest they could have received from an alternative investment over those 10 years, which is effectively an additional investment, so the original share price of 90 was correct."

    "topic": "Why do stocks go up? Is it due to companies performing well, or what else? [duplicate]",
    "content": "The value of a stock ultimately is related to the valuation of a corporation. As part of the valuation, you can estimate the cash flows discounted to present time of the expected cash flows from owning a share. This stock value is the socalled \"fundamental\" value of a stock. What you are really asking is, how is the stocks market price and the fundamental value related? And by asking this, you have implicitly assumed they are not the same. The reason that the fundamental value and market price can diverge is that simply, most shareholders will not continue holding the stock for the lifespan of a company indeed some companies have been around for centuries. This means that without dividends or buybacks or liquidations or mergersacquisitions, a typical shareholder cannot reasonably expect to recoup their share of the companys equity. In this case, the chief price driver is the aggregate expectation of buyers and sellers in the marketplace, not fundamental evaluation of the companys balance sheet. Now obviously some expectations are based on fundamentals and expert opinions can differ, but even when all the experts agree roughly on the numbers, it may be that the market price is quite a ways away from their estimates. An interesting example is given in this survey of behavioral finance. It concerns Palm, a whollyowned subsidiary of 3Com. When Palm went public, its shares went for such a high price, they were significantly higher than 3Coms shares. This mispricing persisted for several weeks. Note that this facet of pricing is often given short shrift in standard explanations of the stock market. It seems despite decades of academic research and Nobel prizes being handed out to behavioral economists, the knowledge has been slow to trickle down to laymen, although any observant person will realize something is amiss with the standard explanations. For example, before 2012, the last time Apple paid out dividends was 1995. Are we really to believe that people were pumping up Apples stock price from 1995 to 2012 because they were waiting for dividends, or hoping for a merger or liquidation? It doesnt seem plausible to me, especially since after Apple announced dividends that year, Apple stock ended up taking a deep dive, despite Wall Street analysts stating the company was doing better than ever. That the stock price reflects expectations of the future cash flows from the stock is a thinlydisguised form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis EMH, and theres a lot of evidence contrary to the EMH see references in the previouslylinked survey. If you believe what happened in Apples case was just a rational reevaluation of Apple stock, then I think you must be a hardcore EMH advocate. Basically and this is elaborated at length in the survey above, fundamentals and market pricing can become decoupled. This is because there are frictions in the marketplace making it difficult for people to take advantage of the mispricing. In some cases, this can go on for extended periods of time, possibly even years. Part of the friction is caused by strong beliefs by market participants which can often shift pressure to supply or demand. Two popular sayings on Wall Street are, \"It doesnt matter if youre right. You have to be right at the right time.\" and \"It doesnt matter if youre right, if the market disagrees with you.\" They suggest that you can make the right decision with where to put your money, but being \"right\" isnt what drives prices. The market does what it does, and its subject to the whims of its participants."

    "topic": "How do share buybacks work?",
    "content": "Something to note is that when a company announces a share buyback program there is usually a time frame and amount of shares that are important details as it isnt like the company will make one big buy back of stock generally. Rather it may take months or even years as noted in the Wikipedia article about share repurchases. Wikipedia covers some of the technical details here but to give a specific set of answers When a company announces a share buyback program, who do they actually buy back the shares from? From the Wikipedia link \"Under US corporate law there are five primary methods of stock repurchase open market, private negotiations, repurchase put rights, and two variants of selftender repurchase a fixed price tender offer and a Dutch auction.\" Thus, there are open market and a couple of other possibilities. Openly traded shares on a stock exchange? Possibly, though there are other options. Is there a fixed price that they buy back at? Sometimes. Id think a \"fixed price tender offer\" would imply a fixed price though the open market way may take various prices. If I own shares in that company, can I get them to buy back my shares? Selective BuyBacks is noted in Wikipedia as \"In broad terms, a selective buyback is one in which identical offers are not made to every shareholder, for example, if offers are made to only some of the shareholders in the company. In the US, no special shareholder approval of a selective buyback is required. In the UK, the scheme must first be approved by all shareholders, or by a special resolution requiring a 75 majority of the members in which no vote is cast by selling shareholders or their associates. Selling shareholders may not vote in favor of a special resolution to approve a selective buyback. The notice to shareholders convening the meeting to vote on a selective buyback must include a statement setting out all material information that is relevant to the proposal, although it is not necessary for the company to provide information already disclosed to the shareholders, if that would be unreasonable.\" Thus it is possible, though how probable is another question. While not in the question, something to consider is how the buybacks can be done as a result of offsetting the dilution of employees who have stock options that may exercise them and spread the earnings over more shares, but this is more on understanding the employee stock option scenario that various big companies use when it comes to giving employees an incentive to help the stock price."

If it expires, then you will have a shortterm capital gain on the option position at expiration. If it is exercised, then the option is \"gone\" for tax purposes and your basis in the underlying is adjusted. From IRS Publication 550 If a call you write is exercised and you sell the underlying stock, increase your amount realized on the sale of the stock by the amount you received for the call when figuring your gain or loss. The gain or loss is long term or short term depending on your holding period of the stock. In your case, this will be a longterm capital gain. For completeness, if you buy to cover the option back from the market before expiration or exercise, then it is also a shortterm capital gain. Also, keep in mind that this all assumes that this covered call is \"qualified\" so that it does not count as a straddle.

    "topic": "How should I save money if the real interest rate after inflation is negative?",
    "content": "Real interest rates are so low because governments want people to use their money to improve the economy by spending or investing rather than saving. Their idea is that by consuming or investing you will help to create jobs that will employ people who will spend or invest their pay, and so on. If you want to keep this money for the future you dont want to spend it and interest rates make saving unrewarding therefore you ought to invest. That was the why, now the how. Inflation protected securities, mentioned in another answer, are the least risk way to do this. These are government guaranteed and very unlikely to default. On the other hand deflation will cause bigger problems for you and the returns will be pitiful compared with historical interest rates. So what else can be done? Investing in companies is one way of improving returns but risk starts to increase so you need to decide what risk profile is right for you. Investing in companies does not mean having to put money into the stock market either directly or indirectly through funds although index tracker funds have good returns and low risk. The corporate bond market is lower risk for a lesser reward than the stock market but with better returns than current interest rates. Investment grade bonds are very low risk, especially in the current economic climate and there are exchange traded funds ETFs to diversify more risk away. Since you dont mention willingness to take risk or the kind of amounts that you have to save Ive tried to give some low risk options beyond \"buy something inflation linked\" but you need to take care to understand the risks of any product you buy or use, be they a bank account, TIPS, bond investments or whatever. Avoid anything that you dont fully understand."

    "topic": "Why are estimated taxes due early for the 2nd and 3rd quarters only?",
    "content": "There are too many nuances to the question asked to explore fully but here are a few points to keep in mind. If you are a cashbasis taxpayer most individuals are, then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet. If you operate on an accrual basis, then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client. You can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates, and if these together with any income tax withholding from wagepaying jobs are at least 90 of your tax liability for that year, then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year. If your income does vary considerably over the year even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds, the income can vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in December, then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax. This is called the annualization method a part of Form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it. Your annualized income for the payment due on June 15 is 2.4  125 times your taxable income through May 31. Thus, on Form 2210, you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income through May 31 will continue for the rest of the year. You then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45 of that amount by June 15. Similarly for September 15 for which you look at income through August 31, you use a multiplier of 1.5  128 and need to pay 67.5 of the tax on the annualized income, and so on. If you miscalculate these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment, then you owe penalties for that quarter. Most people find that guesstimating the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method. Even simpler is to pay 100 of last years tax in four equal installments 110 for high earners and then no penalty is due at all. If your business is really taking off and your income is going to be substantially higher in one year, then this 100110 of last years tax deal could allow you to postpone a significant chunk of your tax bill till April 15."

If the dealer did not inform you during the allowed window, depending on the state, they may have to refund the entire down payment.

They only require 3.5 down if I recall the number right, and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580. The problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines such as signing up for new credit cards, etc., they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit. First, your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor, then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added. While your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts, your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect, assuming youre making all of the payments on time. A good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history, and to make sure its a mix of account types, such as store cards, installment loans, and credit cards, to show that you can handle various types of credit. Be careful not to add TOO much credit, because it affects your debttoincome ratio, and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing. I really suggest that you look at some of the sites which offer free credit scores, because some of them provide great advice and tips on how to achieve what youre trying to do. They also offer credit score simulators, which can help you understand how your score might change if, for instance, you add new credit cards, pay off existing cards, or take on installment loans.

    "content": "The only problem that I see is that by not giving the 20 right away, you might need to pay PMI for a few months. In addition, in the case of conventional loans, I heard that banks will not remove the PMI after reaching 80 LTV without doing an appraisal. In order to be removed automatically, you need to reach 78 LTV. Finally, I think you can get a better interest by giving 20 down, and you can get a conventional loan instead of a FHA loan, which offers the option to avoid the PMI altogether on FHA, you have two PMIs one upfront and one monthly, and the monthly one is for the life of the loan if you give less than 10."

    "topic": "How does conversion of Secured Convertible Notes work?",
    "content": "Lets assume that the bonds have a par value of 1,000. If conversion happens, then one bond would be converted into 500 shares. The price in the market is unimportant. Regardless of the share price in the market, the income per share would be increased by the absence of 70 in interest expense. It would be decreased by the lost tax deduction. It would be further diluted by the increase in 500 shares. Likewise, the debt would be extinguished and the equity section increased. Whether it increased or decreased on a per share basis would depend upon the average amount paid in per share in the currently existing structure, adjusted for changes in retained earnings since the initial offering and for any treasury shares. There would be a loss in value, generally, if it is trading far from 2.00 because it would be valued based on the market price. Had the bond not converted, it would trade in the market as a pure bond if the stock price is far below the strike price and as an ordinary pure bond plus a premium if near enough to the strike price in a manner that depends upon the time remaining under the conversion privilege. I cannot think of a general case where someone would want to convert below strike and indeed, barring a very strange tax, inheritance or legal situation such as a weird divorce, I cannot think of a case where it would make sense. It often does not make sense to convert far from maturity either as the option premium only vanishes well above 2. The primary case for conversion would be where the aftertax dividend is greater than the aftertax interest payment."

    "topic": "Should I consolidate loans and cards, or just cards, leaving multiple loans?",
    "content": "My answer is similar to Ben Millers, but let me make some slightly different points There is one excellent reason to get a consolidation loan You can often get a lower interest rate. If you are presently paying 19 on a credit card and you can roll that into a personal loan at 13.89, youll be saving over 5, which can add up. I would definitely not consolidate a loan at 12.99 into a loan at 13.89. Then youre just adding 1 to your interest rate. Whats the benefit in this? Another good reasons for a consolidation loan is psychological. A consolidation loan with fixed payments forces you to pay that amount every month. You say you have trouble with credit cards. Its very easy to say to yourself, \"Oh, just this month Im going to pay just the minimum so I can use my cash for this other Very Important Thing that I need to buy.\" And then next month you find something else that you just absolutely have to buy. And again the next month, and the next, and your determination to seriously pay down your debt keeps getting pushed off. If you have a fixed monthly payment, you cant. Youre committed. Also, if you have many credit cards, juggling payments on all of them can get complex and confusing. Its easy to lose track of how much you owe and to budget for payments. At worst, when there are many bills to pay you may forget one. Personally I now have 3 bank cards, an airline card, and 2 store cards, and managing them is getting out of hand. I have good reasons for having so many cards the airline card and the store cards give me special discounts. But its confusing to keep track of. As to adding 3,000 to the consolidation loan Very, very bad idea. You are basically saying, \"I have to start seriously paying down my debt ... tomorrow. Today I need a some extra cash so Im going to borrow just a little bit more, but Im going to get started paying it off next month.\" This is a trap, and the sort of trap that leads people into spiraling debt. Start paying off debt NOW, not at some vague time in the future that never seems to come."

    "content": "I strongly suggest you read up the Option Greeks. You can be right about a stocks price movement and still not make money bc other factors come into play from time or volatility. For a \"free\" option hedge you can look at collars. Buying puts and selling calls to offset the debit you pay for the transaction. Ex AAPL is 115, You buy the 110 puts and sell the 120 calls. This gives you a collar around he current price. Your hedged below 110 and can still participate in upside move to 120. Also look into time value. Time decays exponentially in the last 30 days. If you are long this hurts you, if you are shortselling this is good. Be sure to take this into account. Delta relation of the option to the underlying stock move on a .011 scale, .50 is \"normal.\" Deep in the money options have higher deltas. It is possible other factors can offset this delta move. This is why people will lose money on earnings plays even though they are right. EX Say you buy an AAPL call at 120, earnings comes out and the stock goes to 121. Even though you are \"in the money\" your contract may still have less value than what you paid because of VOLATILITY collapse. The market place knows earnings move a stock and that is factored into the price of the options expected volatility. As mentioned watch out for dividend dates. Always be aware of dividend dates and earnings dates and if your contract is going to cover one of these events. Interest rates have an effect as well but since the Fed has near 0 rates there is little impact at the present. Though this could certainly change if the fed starts raising rates. Research the Black Scholes Pricing model. Whenever you trade always think about what the other guys is thinking. Sometimes we forget their is someone else on the other side of my trade that thinks essentially the exact opposite of me. Its a zero sum game. As far as choosing strikes you can look at calculating the At THe money straddle to see if the options are \"cheap\" [stock Price  Implied Volatility for 30, 60, 90 days Depending on your holding period Sq root of days to expiration]  19 which is sq root of daysyr Add and subtract this number to the current stock price to give you an approximate 1 standard deviation of expected price movement. Keeping with our example. AAPL at 115, lets say your formula spits out a 6 therefore price range is expected to be 109 to 121 for the time period. Helpful for selling options, I would sell the 122 call or the 108 puts. Hope this helps. Start small and get a feel for things."

For a stock to be sold short, it has to be marginable which means it has to trade over  5.00. The broker, therefore, cant borrow the stock for you to sell short because it isnt held in their clients margin accounts. My guess is that Etrade, along with other brokers, simply exclude these stocks for short selling. Ivestopedia has an explanation of nonmarginable securities. Specific to stocks under 5 Other securities, such as stocks with share prices under 5 or with extremely high betas, may be excluded at the discretion of the broker itself."

With a paidup policy, you make payments until a particular age usually 65 or 70, at which point you are insured for the rest of your life or a very old age like 120. You can also access this pool of money via loans while you are still alive, but you reduce your benefit until you repay the loans. This may be advantageous if you have a high net worth. Also, if you own a business or farm, a permanent policy may be desirable if the transfer of your property to heirs is likely to generate alot of transactional costs like taxes. Nowadays there are probably better ways to do that too. Whole lifeuniversal life is a waste of money 95 of the time. An example, my wife and I were recently offered openenrollment no medical exam insurance policies our employers in New York. Were in our early 30s. I bought a term policy paying about 400k which costs 19mo. My wife was offered a permanent policy that pays 100k which costs 83mo, and would have a cash value of 35k at age 65.

    "content": "Many big companies self insure. They pay the insurance company to manage the claims, and to have access to their network of doctors, hospitals, specialists, and pharmacies but cover the costs on a shared basis with the employees. Medium sized companies use one of the standard group policies. Small companies either have expensive policies because they are a small group, or they have to join with other small companies through an association to create a larger group. The bigger the group the less impact each individual person has on the group cost. The insurance companies reprice their policies each year based on the expected demographics of the groups, the negotiated rates with the network of providers, the required level of coverage, and the actual usage of the group from the previo year.. If the insurance company does a poor job of estimating the performance of the group, it hits their profits which will cause them to raise their rates the next year which can impact the number of companies that use them. Some provisions of the new health care laws in the US govern portability of insurance regarding preexisting conditions, minimum coverage levels, and the elimination of many lifetime cap. Prior to these changes the switching of employers while very sick could have a devastating impact on the finances of the family. The lifetime cap could make it hard to cover the person if they had very expensive illnesses. If the illness doesnt impact your ability to work, there is no need to discuss it during the interview process. It wont need to be discussed except while coordinating care during the transition. There is one big issue though. If the old company uses Aetna, and the new company doesnt then you might have to switch doctors, or hospitals or go outofnetwork at a potentially even bigger cost to you."

The point is that none of them allow you to avoid tax, but by deferring from years when you have high income to years when you have lower income allows you to realize less total tax paid due to the marginal rate for personal income tax. The corporate dividend approach as explained in another answer is one way. TFSAs are another way, but as you point out, they have limits. Since you brought TFSAs into your question About the best and easiest tax deferral option available in Canada is the RRSP. If you dont have a company pension, you can contribute something like 18 of your income. If you have a pension plan, you may still be able to contribute to an RRSP as well, but the maximum contribution amount will be lower. The contribution lowers your taxable income which can save you tax. Interest earned on the equity in your RRSP isnt taxed. Tax is only paid on money drawn from the plan because it is deemed income in that year. They are intended for retirement, but youre allowed to withdraw at any time, so if you have little or no income in a year, you can draw money from your RRSP.

When you withdraw, contributions come out first, so as long as you dont withdraw more than the amount of past contributions, you wont have any tax or penalty. And if its not going to have tax, it doesnt really matter if you do it this year or next year.

    "content": "I see some merit in the other answers, which are all based on the snowball method. However, I would like to present an alternative approach which would be the optimal way in case you have perfect selfcontrol. Given your amount of debt, most likely you currently do not have perfect selfcontrol, but we will come to that. The first step is to think about what the minimum amount of emergency funds are that you need and to compare this number with your credit card limit. If your limits are such that your credit cards can still cover potential emergency expenses, use all of the 4000 to repay the debt on the loan with the higher interest rate. Some answer wrote that Others may disagree as it is more efficient to pay down the 26er. However, if you pay it all of within the year the difference only comes to 260. This is bad advice because you will probably not pay back the loan within one year. Where would you miraculously obtain 20 000 for that? Thus, paying back the higher interest loan will save you more money than just 260. Next, follow Chris s advice and refinance your debt under a lower rate. This is much more impactful than choosing the right loan to repay. Make sure to consult with different banks to get the best rate. Reducing your interest rate has utmost priority! From your accumulated debt we can probably infer that you do not have perfect selfcontrol and will be able to minimize your spendingmaximize your debt repayments. Thus, you need to incentivize yourself to follow such behavior. A powerful way to do this is to have a family member or very close friend monitor your purchase and saving behavior. If you cannot control yourself, someone else must. It should rather be a a person you trust than the banks you owe money."

I dont see anything you should be deathly concerned about unless your career outlook is very poor and you are making minimum wage. If that is the case you may struggle for the next 10 years. Are these rates considered super high or manageable? The rates for the federal loans are around twice as high as your private loans but that is the going rate and there is nothing you can do about it now. 6.5 isnt bad on what is essentially a personal loan. 23 are very manageable assuming you pay them and dont let the interest build up. What is a good mode of attack here? I am by no means a financial adviser and dont know the rest of your financial situation, but the most general advice I can give you is pay down your highest interest rate loans first and always try to pay more than the minimum. In your case, I would put as much as you reasonably can towards the federal loans because that will save you money in the long run. What are the main takeaways I should understand about these loans? The main takeaway is that these are student loans and they cannot be discharged if you were to ever declare bankruptcy. Pay them off but dont be too concerned about them. If you do apply for loans in the future, most lenders wont be too concerned about student loans assuming you are paying them on time and especially if you are paying more than the minimum payment. What are the payoff dates for the other loans? The payoff dates for the other loans are a little hard to easily calculate, but it appears they all have different payoff dates between 8 and 12 years from now. This part might be easier for someone who is better at financial calculations than me. Why do my Citi loans have a higher balance than the original payoff amounts? Your citi loans have a higher balance probably because you have not payed anything towards them yet so the interest has been accruing since you got them."

Is there a easy way to automatically ie. through an API or something, not through just reading a prospectus get information about an ETFs underlying securities? I have looked for this information before, and based on my own searches, in a word no. Index providers, and providers of APIs which provide index information, make money off of such services. The easiest way may be to navigate to each provider and download the CSV with the full list of holdings, if one exists. You can then drop this into your pipeline and write a program to pull the data from the CSV file. You could drop the entire CSV into Excel and use VBA to automagically pull the data into a usable format. For example, on the page for XIU.TO on the Blackrock site, after clicking the \"All Holdings\" tab there is a link to \"Download holdings\", which will provide you with a CSV.

You have a gain of 5. Your hypothecated loss is unlimited in that the stock could go to 1mil a share. That loss is an opportunity loss you still had a modest profit in actual . The naked call is a different beast. you get the 1.00 in commission to sell a stock you dont own but must pay for that right. so lets say you net .75 in commission per share after your sell the option. as long as the stock trades below 14.00 during the period of the option you sold your golden. It rises above the strike price you must now buy that stock at market to fill the order when the counter party choses to exercise the option which results in a REAL loss of 100 of the stocks market price less the .75 a share you made. in the scenarios a 1000 shares that for up 30.00 a share over the strike price make you 5,000 in a covered call and lose you 29,250 in a naked call.Naked calls are speculative. Covered calls are strategic."

I have heard that it is better for your credit score to pay them down over time. Will it make much of a difference? Will the money you save by increasing your credit score assuming this statement is true be larger than by eliminating the interest payments for the credit card payments over \"a few months\" 13 APR at 24,000 is 3120 a year in interest 260 a month, so if \"a few months\" is three, that would cost over 700  note that as you pay more principal the overall amount of interest decreases, so the \"a year\" in interest could go down depending on the principal payments. Also, on a related note regarding credit score, it doesnt look good to have more than a third of a credit line available balance exceeded see number 2 here httpcredit.about.comodbuildingcredittpbuildinggoodcredit.htm."

A standard, commercial letter of credit LC is a document issued mostly by a financial institution, used primarily in trade finance, which usually provides an irrevocable payment undertaking. So yes, they are primarily for use by businesses. If you will read the article stating the terms and conditions for payment and shipment you will realize that such model wont be of much value to and will create many hurdles for a typical consumer. Yes, you can cash a letter of credit but only once the conditions in the letter have been met e.g., deliveryshipment of goodsservices. An array of documents need to be presented as well. Whether it is easy or not is a very subjective question. A bank will issue a letter of credit only when it is reasonably sure that its risk is covered either backed by a bank deposit or by conditions in the letter itself. Obviously derivatives on these letters have evolved as well."

The value of most currencies is closely tied to the economy of the county, so if China were to print a huge amount of yuan, then since the value of their economy has not really changed, the international currency markets would devalue the yuan to compensate. This is rather like, if have shares in, say Apple, and they were to issue an extra billion shares, then the value of your shares would fall by half, rather than for Apple to be suddenly be worth twice as much Print too many notes and your currency basically becomes almost worthless, which is what happened to the Zimbabwean dollar. I like the idea of China skipping crate loads of actual yuan or dollars notes to America, but in practice, the borrowing is just a paper exercise, rather like an IOU. As to whether America owes Yuan or dollars, the answer is whatever has been agreed. Assuming the currencies are fairly stable, then since each country has more control over their own currency, it is natural for them to prefer their own currency. However, if America believes the value of the dollar will increase, they may prefer to pay back in Yuan costing them less dollars, and if China believes the value of the dollar will decrease they may agree to that."

The safe outcome for the reporting agency is to remove the information in dispute from reports within 30 days if the reporting party does not certify the information is complete and accurate with other statutory timelines for communication to the customer and the reporter. If you initiate a dispute, then the agency is following the law by deleting the reported information, outside new input from the furnisher. If this is unsatisfactory, you have the following statutory right within  611. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [15 U.S.C.  1681i d Notification of deletion of disputed information. Following any deletion of information which is found to be inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified or any notation as to disputed information, the consumer reporting agency shall, at the request of the consumer, furnish notification that the item has been deleted or the statement, codification or summary pursuant to subsection b or c of this section to any person specifically designated by the consumer who has within two years prior thereto received a consumer report for employment purposes, or within six months prior thereto received a consumer report for any other purpose, which contained the deleted or disputed information. The section that binds furnishers of information  623. Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies [15 U.S.C.  1681s2], starting on page 78 in the footer places on them the following specific duties B Reporting information after notice and confirmation of errors. A person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if i the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate and ii the information is, in fact, inaccurate. ... 2 Duty to correct and update information. A person who A regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more consumer reporting agencies about the persons transactions or experiences with any consumer and B has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate, shall promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide to the agency any corrections to that information, or any additional information, that is necessary to make the information provided by the person to the agency complete and accurate, and shall not thereafter furnish to the agency any of the information that remains not complete or accurate.

Note that banks will generally give better rates on a personal loan than a finance company. People usually only use finance companies when their credit is so bad that a bank will not loan them money. Heating and cooling companies that provide equipment will often loan the money to buy that equipment. As a point of advice, it is generally poor financial management to take out personal loans and may indicate a person that is wasting money or be in financial difficulties. For personal loan items furniture, cars, clothing, jewelry, etc you are far better off saving money to buy the item, not borrowing beyond your means. If you need a new furnace and it is an emergency, for example, if it were winter which it is not and your furnace could not be repaired, then that might justifiable.

    "topic": "Why is a stock dividend considered a dividend? What makes it different from a stock split?",
    "content": "You can argue that cash dividend is a kind of split as well by this logic. The stock price on exdividend gets a hit coincidental with the dividend to be paid, so one can argue that the investor has the same cash value on the day the dividend was paid as if it wouldnt be paid at all. However, for the company to distribute stocks instead of cash may be advantageous if they have low cash reserves but significant amount of treasury stocks, and the stocks are of high liquidity. It is also a way for the company to release treasury stocks without diluting the current shareholders and creating taxable income to the company, thats an important factor to consider. This is in fact the real answer to your question. The main difference between split and stock dividend is that in split, the stock distributions proportions dont change. With stock dividend  they do. While the outstanding share proportions do not change, total proportions do, because of the treasury stocks being distributed. So company has less stocks in its vaults, but everyone else still has the same proportions of ownership. Compare this to split companys treasury stocks would be split as well, and it would continue essentially sitting on the same proportion of stocks. That shift of treasury stocks to the outside shareholders  this is what makes it a dividend."

    "content": "Having been in exactly this position not in a debt hole, built a budget to get a better view of what spending is, I can say what the greatest gift it brings is its a decision tool. When you are spending out of only one account, you often make decisions based on the total money in the account. Should we go out for dinner? Can I make this impulse purchase? This is terrible, because many, if not all, of those dollars are already intended for certain future expenses like groceries, bills, etc. You cant see how many of those dollars are discretionary. A budget is like having many accounts. Instead of looking at your real accounts to make spending decisions, you look at your budget lines. You to want impulse buy a gadget  do you have money remaining in a relevant budget line? If yes, the decision is yours, if no, the budget is telling you that you dont have dollars for that. Similarly for more prosaic purchases  you want to splurge on some nonstaple groceries to make a fancy dinner or try out a new recipe, and the budget line for Groceries will tell you if you can do that. Instead of looking at e.g. 6000 in a chequing account, youre looking at 600 assigned  146.86 spend  453.14 available in a monthly groceries budget line. Just like you can now see where your money has been going, by maintaining and using your budget lines, and having every single dollar you spend go through the budget to show your totally assigned, total spent, and total remaining, you can continue to see where your money is going in near realtime. Youre no longer looking at bills and statements to figure out whats going on and plan, youre looking at money flows and future intentions, as you should be. This approach to budgeting has completely changed our finances. So thats what a budget is for realtime spending decisionmaking control over your money, which for us has translated into a lovely mix of painless austerity in spending categories where austerity is smart, and guiltfree spending in more indulgent categories because we have already determined exactly how much we can afford and wish to spend.  A budget line with insufficient funds doesnt actually take the decision entirely away from you though. If a budget line doesnt have funds to spare for a given purchase, you can still make the purchase  but now youre also making the decision to go and revise your budget, taking dollars away from other budget lines to adjust the line youve overspent, to keep the budget accurate."

Any investment has its risks of losing your capital, but not investing is a guaranteed risk, as you will be guaranteed to fall behind the rate of inflation. Regarding investing on margin, this can increase your gains but can also increase your loses. Regarding the stock market  when investing in stocks you should not only look at the dividend rate but also the capital gain or loss potential. Remember in regards to investing on margin, if the share price drop too much you can get a margin call no matter how much dividend you are getting. It is no use gaining 9 in dividend yield per year if you are losing 15 or more in capital each year. Also, what is the risk of the dividend rate being cut back or dividends not being paid at all in the future? These are some of the risks you should consider before investing and derive a risk management plan as part of your investment plan before you invest. No investment is totally safe or risk free, but it is less risky than not investing at all, as long as you understand the risks involved and have a risk management plan in place as part of your overall investment plan."

Pretty much every question about how stock prices work is answered by the paragraph above, which an astonishingly large number of people dont seem to be aware of. So there is no explicit \"tracking\" mechanism at all. Just people buying and selling, and if the current going price on two exchanges differ, then that is an opportunity for someone to make money by buying on one exchange and selling on the other  until the prices are close enough that the fees and overhead make that activity unprofitable. This is called \"arbitrage\" and a common activity of investment banks or more recently hedge funds and specialized trading firms spun off by said banks due to regulation."

    "topic": "How did this day trader lose so much?",
    "content": "Learn something new every day... I found this interesting and thought Id throw my 2c in. Good description I hope from Short Selling What is Short Selling First, lets describe what short selling means when you purchase shares of stock. In purchasing stocks, you buy a piece of ownership in the company. You buysell stock to gainsell ownership of a company. When an investor goes long on an investment, it means that he or she has bought a stock believing its price will rise in the future. Conversely, when an investor goes short, he or she is anticipating a decrease in share price. Short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller doesnt own. More specifically, a short sale is the sale of a security that isnt owned by the seller, but that is promised to be delivered. Still with us? Heres the skinny when you short sell a stock, your broker will lend it to you. The stock will come from the brokerages own inventory, from another one of the firms customers, or from another brokerage firm. The shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account. Sooner or later, you must \"close\" the short by buying back the same number of shares called covering and returning them to your broker. If the price drops, you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference. If the price of the stock rises, you have to buy it back at the higher price, and you lose money. So what happened? The Plan The Reality Lesson I never understood what \"Shorting a stock\" meant until today. Seems a bit risky for my blood, but I would assume this is an extreme example of what can go wrong. This guy literally chose the wrong time to short a stock that was, in all visible aspects, on the decline. How often does a Large Company or Individual buy stock on the decline... and send that stock soaring? How often does a stock go up 100 in 24 hours? 600? Another example is recently when Oprah bought 10 of Weight Watchers and caused the stock to soar 105 in 24 hours. You would have rued the day you shorted that stock  on that particular day  if you believed enough to \"gamble\" on it going down in price."

    "topic": "Other than being able to borrow to invest, how is a margin trading account different from a cash account?",
    "content": "In summary In long form Spreads and shorts are not allowed in cash accounts, except for covered options. Brokers will allow clients to roll option positions in a single transaction, which look like spreads, but these are not actually \"sell to open\" transactions. \"Sell to open\" is forbidden in cash accounts. Short positions from closing the long half of a covered trade are verboten. Daytrading is allowed in both margin and cash accounts. However, \"pattern daytrading\" only applies to margin accounts, and requires a minimum account balance of 25,000. Cash accounts are free to buy and sell the same security on the same day over and over, provided that there is sufficient buying power to pay for opening a new position. Since proceeds are held for both stock and option sales in a cash account, that means buying power available at the start of the day will drop with each purchase and not rise again until settlement. Unsettled funds are available immediately within margin accounts, without restriction. In cash accounts, using unsettled funds to purchase securities will require you to hold the new position until funds settle  otherwise your account will be blocked for \"freeriding\". Legally, you can buy securities in a cash account without available cash on deposit with the broker, but most brokers dont allow this, and some will aggressively liquidate any position that you are somehow able to enter for which you didnt have available cash already on deposit. In a margin account, margin can help gloss over the few days between purchase and deposit, allowing you to be somewhat more aggressive in investing funds. A margin account will allow you to make an investment if you feel the opportunity is right before requiring you to deposit the funds. See a great opportunity? With sufficient margin, you can open the trade immediately and then run to the bank to deposit funds, rather than being stuck waiting for funds to be credited to your account. Margin accounts might show up on your credit report. The possibility of losing more than you invested, having positions liquidated when you least expect it, your broker doing possibly stupid things in order to close out an overmargined account, and other consequences are all very serious risks of margin accounts. Although you mentioned awareness of this issue, any answer is not complete with mentioning those risks."

An alternative is an ITIN number, which is now available to nonresidents only if they have US income giving a reason to file a US tax return do you really want to get into all that.... Assuming you did have a reason to get a ITIN one reason would be if you sold some ebooks via Amazon US, and need a withholding refund under the tax treaty, then recent reports on Flyertalk give mixed results on whether its possible to get a credit card with an ITIN, and whether that would build a credit record. It does sound possible in some cases. A credit record in any other country would not help. You would certainly need a US address, and banks are increasingly asking for a physical address, rather than just a mailbox. Regardless, building this history would be of limited benefit to you if you later became a US resident, at that point you would be eligible for a new SSN different from the ITIN and have to largely start again. If getting a card is the aim, rather than the credit record, you may find some banks that will offer a secured card or a debit card, to nonresidents, especially in areas with lots of Canadian visitors border, Florida, Arizona. Youd find it a lot easier with a US address though, and youd need to shop around a lot of banks in person until you find one with the right rules. Most will simply avoid anyone without an SSN."

Your monthly statement is issued on April 12, and since you just received your income tax refund, you pay it off in full on April 30. You dont charge anything to the card at all after April 12. Thus, on April 30, your credit card balance shows as zero since you just paid it off. But your April 12 statement billed you for interest only till April 12. So, on May 12, your next monthly bill will be for the interest for your nonzero balance from April 13 through April 30. Assuming that you still are not making any new charges on your card and pay off the May 12 bill in timely fashion, you will finally have a zero bill on June 12. What if you charge new items to your credit card after April 12? Well, your balance stopped revolving on April 30, and thats when interest is no longer charged on the new charges. But you do owe interest for a charge on April 13 say until April 30 when your balance is no longer revolving, and this will be added to your bill on May 12. Purchases made after April 30 will not be charged interest unless you fall off the wagon again and dont pay your May 12 bill in full by the due date of the bill some time in early June."

The answer is no. The divergence or convergence of BBupper  lower band does not indicate if the market is trending or not. It only indicated if volatility is increasing or decreasing. Or is market trending only in case if both bands, upper and lower, are parallel and at the same time NOT horizontal? The answer is yes. To understand the reason consider that BB is constructed from a central Moving Average along with standard deviation. Upper BandMA2SD, Lower BandMA2SD. A moving average is a trend following indicator and volatility has nothing to do with trend as SD only measures the price movement around the mean. Which essentially means BB has trend following qualities. The upper and lower bands remain more or less parallel in between band contraction and expansion. Refer below You shall see distinctly phases when BB bands are not parallel and are parallel and not horizontal. As mentioned above, when BB bands are expanding or contracting they do not give indication of the trend direction. When they are parallel, close or apart and not horizontal, they provide a good directional bias through the general slope. Though a more effective method to determine trend and its direction is the central MA of BB. Again, refer below Here you can see that some portion of the bands are parallel and more or less horizontal. The price action would tell you that the stock is now rangebound as opposed to trending. The primary use of the BB bands are to gauge volatility as misantroop stated. The primary trend direction is usually derived from the central MA."

In order to diversify you would be using correlations and some common sense. Recall the recent global financial crisis, ones of the first to crash were AAArated CDOs, stocks and so on. Because correlation is a statistical measure this can work fine when the economy is stable, but it doesnt account for reallife interrelations, especially when population is affected. Once consumers are affected this spans to the entire economy so that sectors that previously seemed unrelated have now been tied together by the fall in demand or reduced ability to payoff. I always find it funny how US advisers tell you to hold 80 of US stocks and bonds, while UK ones tell you to stick to the UK securities. The same happens all over the world, I would assume. The safest portfolio is a Global Market portfolio, obviously I wouldnt be getting, say, Somalian bonds if such exist at all, but there are plenty of markets to choose from. A chance of all of them crashing simultaneously is significantly lower. Why dont people include derivatives in their portfolios? Could be because these are mainly shortterm, while most of the portfolios are being held for a significant amount of time thus capital and money markets are the key components. Derivatives are used to hedge these portfolios. As for the currencies  by having foreign stocks and bonds you are already exposed to FX risk so you, again, could be using it as a hedging instrument."

Since they are selling it as a security, they sell for future value, meaning they sell our 200,000 loan for a valuation of 360,000. This means that they sell for 200,000 PLUS some fraction of the additional 160,000. Lets say they only want a 10 premium of the 360,000 valuation. That means they sell our 200,000 loan for 236,000.

Last but not least, you can always get your pick at some value companies stocks usually big companies that have proven track record, check warren buffet on this. You should look for stocks that pay dividends since you are in for the long run and not just to make a quick buck. I hope I helped a bit and as always be cautious about investing since they have some inherent risks. If you dont feel comfortable with making your own investment choices you should contact a specialist like a financial planner or advisor. No matter what the case may be on this, you should still educate yourself on this... just to get a grasp on this."

    "content": "Material Information means that any information that can reasonable affect the share price of the company [upward or downward] as looked by the investors. The idea is to provide a level playing field to all investors. Hence it forces people having material information not to trade when they have this information that is not yet disclosed. Yes it happens all the time and laws are quite stringent. There is monitoring of share activity by regulators ... hence most of the times the companies come out with their own guidelines and top  senior management is prohibited from trading in their own companys shares for pretty much round the year except few windows the company decides is safe. Now it may not be possible to monitor every small material info, but any large spike of stocks after certain announcements is investigated by regulators to verify any undue gains. For ex a person who never trades suddenly buys large qty of shares and it goes up and he sells again ... etc"

If you use every last dime to pay for a house, youll have no cushion available when something breaks down. The most common recommendation Ive seen is to have 36 months worth of expenses as an emergency fund. Once you have that, then you can start saving for your down payment. As Victor says, try to find the best interest rate you can for that money, but I wouldnt invest it in any kind of stock or bond product, because your need for it is too short term. Safety is more important than growth given your time frame. When youre ready to invest, make sure you learn all you can. You dont want to invest in something you dont understand, because thats how you get ripped off. You can be reading and talking to people while youre saving for your house so that, when the time comes, youll have a pretty good idea of what you want to do for investments."

To find out your FICO score, navigate to AnnualCreditReport, the official site to help consumers receive their credit report from each of the three organizations providing these scores  Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You are  in many states  entitled to a free copy of your credit report from each of these organizations annually. This copy of your credit report will not contain your credit score from that organization. It will, however, contain information that goes into your credit score  the lines of credits on file, any delinquencies reported, etc. If you decide you would like to pay for your credit score from each bureau, you will have the option to receive this information while getting your credit report, but you will have to pay a nominal fee for it. Remember that each of the 3 bureaus gives you a different score. Averaging your 3 scores should give you a good idea of your FICO score. Note that your report is far more important than your score  once you know that, you know if youre in a good place or not. These other questions are so close that they might even be considered duplicates, and provide other suggestions for how to check your score. As a warning, dont trust the many ads out there saying you can get your score for free. Only AnnualCreditReport is considered a safe place for entering the very personal information required to get a score. The FTC backs this up."

    "topic": "Why buy insurance?",
    "content": "You dont mention what kind of insurance youre talking about, but Ill just address one angle on the question. For some kinds of insurance, such as health insurance in the US, auto insurance, and homeowners insurance, you may be insuring against an event that you would not be able to pay for without the insurance. For instance, if you are at fault in a car accident and injure someone, they could sue you for 100,000. A lot of people dont have 100,000. So its not even a matter of \"Ill take the risk of having to pay it when the time comes\" if the time comes, you could lose virtually everything you own and still have to pay more from future earnings. Youre not just paying X to offset a potential loss of Y youre paying X to offset a potential derailment of your entire life. It is plausible that you could assign a reasonable monetary value to that potential \"cost\" that would mean you actually come out ahead in the insurance equation. It is with smaller expenses such as insuring a new cellphone against breakage that insurance becomes harder to justify. When the potential nonfinancial \"collateral damage\" of a bad event are less, you must justify the insurance expenses on the financial consequences only, which, as you say, is often difficult."

The price ranges Ive given include filing, state fees, getting a tax ID number EIN, operating agreement, membership certificates, registered agent fees and publication fees if done in New York. Each state also have licensing boards and city fees that are applicable, so you would want to also make sure that you are keeping compliant there. Yearly paperwork to keep the LLC running wont be so expensive, expect the state to charge a yearly fee and require some basic information to be submitted. I had a quick look at Florida, and with someone filing it for you, expect around 200 to 250 a year, plus registered agent fees. If you are late in Florida the penalty is 400 so you definitely would want a service that provides compliance calendar notifications to make sure you are on time with fees. In regards to bookkeeping and taxes, yearly tax filing will start at 250 to 500 for an LLC and move up from there depending on the services being offered and the amount of time of work. I recently referred someone to an accountant that will charge 250 to file an almost zero tax return on an LLC. I think 40 an hour is a little low for a bookkeeper but it all depends on where you are. I know in some major cities bookkeepers expect 75 an hour or higher. So the expectation in Miami and Manhattan will probably be more expensive than Jacksonville and Albany. If you doing a little business dont expect the cost to be too much on the bookkeeping. So, breakdown 300500 FL  1,000 NY Registration of LLC  any business license, city or other registrations 250 Yearly Fee  Yearly Registered Agent  any business licenses, city or other fee 500 Tax Return  Bookkeeping Fee Banks will charge more than a personal account so expect 120 a year plus. In regards to service I would look at companies that specialize in foreigners setting up businesses in the US, because they will have services designed to help you more than services that primarily specialize with US clients.

    "content": "Can someone please explain how traders and investors use this price difference to trade? People use the price difference for small arbitrage between the futures and spot markets, where the larger spreads are reflected in the options markets. The spread in the options market dictates the VIX which many investors also use in their decision making process. And most importantly how the futures market affects subsequent moves in the stock market? The futures market effects the stock market where large contract holders move the entire futures price. This causes reactionary moves amongst all of the aforementioned arbitragers, who are hedged between the futures and spot markets. With the ES this is reflected down to actual individual stocks based on their weightings in the SP 500 index. Many of those stocks have smaller companies that are also linked to them, such as a widget manufacturer for a gigantic ACME corporation listed in the SP 500."

    "topic": "What effect does a companys earnings have on the price of its stock?",
    "content": "No, the stock market is not there for speculation on corporate memorabilia. At its base, it is there for investing in a business, the point of the investment being, of course, to make money. A successful business earns money, and that makes it valuable to its owners since that money can be distributed to them. Shares of stock are pieces of business ownership, and so are valuable. If you knew that the business would have profit of 10,000,000 every year, and would distribute that to the owners of each of its 10,000,000 shares each year, you would know to that each share would receive 1 each year. How much would such a share be worth to you? If you could instead put money in a bank and get 5 a year back, to get 1 a year back you would have to put 20 into the bank. So maybe that share of stock is worth about 20 to you. If somebody offers to sell you such a share for 18, you might buy it for 23, maybe you pass up the offer. But business is uncertain, and how much profit the business will make is uncertain and will vary through time. So how much is a share of a real business worth? This is a much harder call, and people use many different ways to come up with how much they should pay for a share. Some people probably just think something like \"Apple is a good company making money, Ill buy a share at whatever price it is being offered at right now.\" Others look at every number available, build models of the company and the economy and the risks, all to estimate what a share might be worth, more or less. There is no indisputable value for a share of a successful business. So, what effect does a companys earnings have on the price of its stock? You can only say that for some of the people who might buy or sell shares, higher earnings will, all other thing being equal, have them be willing to spend more to buy it or demand more when selling it. But how much more is not quantifiable but depends on each persons approach to the problem. Higher earnings would tend to raise the price of the stock. Yet there are other factors, such as people who had expected even higher earnings, whose actions would tend to lower the price, and people who are OK with the earnings now, but suspect trouble for the business is appearing on the horizon, whose actions would also tend to lower the price. This is why people say that a stocks price is determined by supply and demand."

Travel insurance helps cover medical expenses like hospitalization, doctor consultations, emergency medical evacuation, and even repatriation in case of serious illness or injury. This financial cushion ensures you receive proper care without worrying about the cost. Trip Disruptions Flight cancellations or delays Missed flights, lost luggage, or unexpected changes in your itinerary can cause inconvenience and financial losses. Travel insurance can reimburse you for nonrefundable expenses like prebooked tours, accommodation costs due to delays, and even replacement flights in some cases. Lost or Stolen Belongings Valuable possessions Losing your passport, phone, or other valuables abroad can be a nightmare. Travel insurance can provide compensation for lost, stolen, or damaged belongings, offering some peace of mind and potentially helping replace essential items. Additional Benefits Personal liability Protection against accidental damage you cause to someone elses property or injury during your trip. Trip cancellation Coverage for trip cancellation costs due to unforeseen circumstances like illness, job loss, or natural disasters. Political unrest or natural disasters Some plans offer coverage for trip interruptions due to political unrest, natural disasters, or other unforeseen events. International Travel Considerations Unfamiliar healthcare systems Navigating foreign healthcare systems can be challenging. Travel insurance can provide assistance with finding medical facilities, translation services, and communication with healthcare providers. Language barriers Communicating effectively in a foreign language can be difficult, especially during emergencies. Travel insurance can offer assistance with communication and translation services. Limited knowledge of local laws and customs Travel insurance can provide access to legal assistance and emergency support in case you encounter unfamiliar legal situations or cultural misunderstandings. Remember While travel insurance cant prevent unexpected events, it can significantly reduce their financial impact and ensure you have access to support and resources when you need them most. Consider the potential risks and costs associated with your specific travel plans before making a decision. By investing in travel insurance, you can enjoy your international adventure with greater peace of mind and financial security."

Roths dont generally care about RMDs at first, but are still subject to them once the person that created the Roth has passed. Having fewer accounts will simplify the RMD stuff, but thats really only a factor in terms of being forced to sell something in each account in order to make the RMD. Other than that, its just a matter of remembering to check each account if you come to a decision that its time to liquidate holdings in a given security, lest you sell some but forget about the rest of it in another account. and perhaps as Chris pointed out, maybe having to pay fees on each account for the sale Where this really can come into play is if you choose to load up each individual account with a given kind of investment, instead of spreading them across the accounts. In that case RMDs could force you into selling something that is currently down when you want to hold onto it, because that is your only choice in order to meet RMDs for account X. So if you have multiple accounts, its a good idea to not silo particular vehicles into a single account, but spread similar ivestments across multiple accounts, so you always have the choice in each account of what to sell in order to meet an RMD. If you have fewer accounts, its thus a lot easier to avoid the siloing effect"

In the first case, investors are bearish because they anticipate selling in the future because all the interested buyers have bought, so all that remains in the short run are people willing to sell and therefore drive down the price. In the second case, the trend is strengthened because the increase in volume indicates that the price movement interested a lot of traders. The trend could be bullish or bearish. The statements arent contradictory because the second case could very well lead to the first case. For example, if an increase in price is coupled with an increase in volume, this could indicate that the positive trend is strengthening second case. Traders are becoming more interested in the price move, so they buy. However, once all of the traders who are willing to enter the market long do so, were in the first case. Investors realize that all of the traders who were interested in buying have bought, so they become bearish because they expect selling to start soon."

Another way to think of it by paying off the debt you are getting a guaranteed 5 return because thats the rate youd have paid if you kept the debt. Be wary of your assumption of getting a 10 return in the SP 500. Nothing is guaranteed, even over the long term. Actual results may well be less, and you could lose money. It doesnt have to be allornothing why not pay off the higher rate debt at 5 and keep the 3 debt? Thats a guaranteed 5 return by paying off the NSLSC loan. And 3 is a pretty low interest rate.

The point is that \"Dollar\" and \"cent\" are not directly related, many currencies that are not called \"Dollar\" are using cents as well Euro, among others.

If you cannot sell your contract then you have to let it expire worthless or you have to exercise it. Those are your three options let it expire, sell it perhaps at a loss, and exercise it.

Like you mentioned, unqualified covered calls suspend the holding period of your stock. For example you sell a deep in the money call sometimes called the last write on a stock you have held for 5 years, the covered call is classified as unqualified, the holding period is suspened and the gain or loss on the stock will be treated as shortterm. Selling out of the money calls or trading in an IRA account keeps things simple. The details below have been summarized from an article I found at investorsguide.com. The article also talks about the implications of rolling a call forward and tax situations where it may be advantageous to write unqualified covered calls basically when you have a large deferred long term loss. httpwww.investorguide.comarticle12618qualifiedcoveredcallsspecialruleswo Two criterion must be met for a covered call to be considered a qualified covered call QCC. 1 days to expiration must be greater than 30 2 strike price must be greater than or equal to the first available in the money strike price below the previous days closing price for a particular stock. Additionally, if the previous days closing price is 25 or less, the strike price of the call being sold must be greater than 85 of yesterdays closing price. 2a If the previous days closing price is greater than 60.01 and less than or equal to 150, days to experation is between 6090, as long as the strike price of the call is greater than 85 of the previous days close and less than 10 points in the money, you can write a covered call two strikes in the money 2c If the previous days closing price is greater than 150 and days till expiration is greater than 90, you can write a covered call two strikes in the money."

    "topic": "If stock price drops by the amount of dividend paid, what is the use of a dividend",
    "content": "Im not a financial expert, but saying that paying a 1 dividend will reduce the value of the stock by 1 sounds like awfully simpleminded reasoning to me. It appears to be based on the assumption that the price of a stock is equal to the value of the assets of a company divided by the total number of shares. But that simply isnt true. You dont even need to do any indepth analysis to prove it. Just look at share prices over a few days. You should easily be able to find stocks whose price varied wildly. If, say, a company becomes the target of a federal investigation, the share price will plummet the day the announcement is made. Did the companys assets really disappear that day? No. Whats happened is that the companys long term prospects are now in doubt. Or a company announces a promising new product. The share price shoots up. They may not have sold a single unit of the new product yet, they havent made a dollar. But their future prospects now look improved. Many factors go into determining a stock price. Sure, total assets is a factor. But more important is anticipated future earning. I think a very simple case could be made that if a stock never paid any dividends, and if everyone knew it would never pay any dividends, that stock is worthless. The stock will never produce any profit to the owner. So why should you be willing to pay anything for it? One could say, The value could go up and you could sell at a profit. But on what basis would the value go up? Why would investors be willing to pay larger and larger amounts of money for an asset that produces zero income? Update I think I understand the source of the confusion now, so let me add to my answer. Suppose that a companys stock is selling for, say, 10. And to simplify the discussion lets suppose that there is absolutely nothing affecting the value of that stock except an expected dividend. The company plans to pay a dividend on a specific date of 1 per share. This dividend is announced well in advance. Everyone knows that it will be paid, and everyone is extremely confidant that in fact the company really will pay it  they wont run out of money or any such. Then in a pure market, we would expect that as the date of that dividend approaches, the price of the stock would rise until the day before the dividend is paid, it is 11. Then the day after the dividend is paid the price would fall back to 10. Why? Because the person who owns the stock on the \"dividend day\" will get that 1. So if you bought the stock the day before the dividend, the next day you would immediately receive 1. If without the dividend the stock is worth 10, then the day before the dividend the stock is worth 11 because you know that the next day you will get a 1 \"refund\". If you buy the stock the day after the dividend is paid, you will not get the 1  it will go to the person who had the stock yesterday  so the value of the stock falls back to the \"normal\" 10. So if you look at the value of a stock immediately after a dividend is paid, yes, it will be less than it was the day before by an amount equal to the dividend. Plus or minus all the other things that affect the value of a stock, which in many cases would totally mask this effect. But this does not mean that the dividend is worthless. Just the opposite. The reason the stock price fell was precisely because the dividend has value. BUT IT ONLY HAS VALUE TO THE PERSON WHO GETS IT. It does me no good that YOU get a 1 dividend. I want ME to get the money. So if I buy the stock after the dividend was paid, I missed my chance. So sure, in the very short term, a stock loses value after paying a dividend. But this does not mean that dividends in general reduce the value of a stock. Just the opposite. The price fell because it had gone up in anticipation of the dividend and is now returning to the \"normal\" level. Without the dividend, the price would never have gone up in the first place. Imagine you had a company with negligible assets. For example, an accounting firm that rents office space so it doesnt own a building, its only tangible assets are some office supplies and the like. So if the company liquidates, it would be worth pretty much zero. Everybody knows that if liquidated, the company would be worth zero. Further suppose that everyone somehow knows that this company will never, ever again pay a dividend. Maybe federal regulators are shutting the company down because its products were declared unacceptably hazardous, or the company was built around one genius who just died, etc. What is the stock worth? Zero. It is an investment that you KNOW has a zero return. Why would anyone be willing to pay anything for it? Its no answer to say that you might buy the stock in the hope that the price of the stock will go up and you can sell at a profit even with no dividends. Why would anyone else pay anything for this stock? Well, unless their stock certificates are pretty and people like to collect them or something like that. Otherwise youre supposing that people would knowingly buy into a pyramid scheme. Of course in real life there are usually uncertainties. If a company is dying, some people may believe, rightly or wrongly, that there is still hope of reviving it. Etc. Dont confuse the value of the assets of a company with the value of its stock. They are related, of course  all else being equal, a company with a billion dollars in assets will have a higher market capitalization than a company with ten dollars in assets. But you cant calculate the price of a companys stock by adding up the value of all its assets, subtracting liabilities, and dividing by the number of shares. Thats just not how it works. Long term, the value of any stock is not the value of the assets but the net present value of the total future expected dividends. Subject to all sorts of complexities in real life."

    "topic": "How are people able to spend more than what they make, without going into debt?",
    "content": "If you make 10 in salary, 5 in interest on savings, and 10 in dividends, your income is 25, not 10. If you have a billion dollars in wellinvested assets, you can take a loan against those assets and the interest payment on the loan will be smaller than the interest you earn on the assets. That means your investment will grow faster than your debt and you have a net positive gain. It makes no sense to do this if the value of your asset is static. In that case, you would be better off just to withdraw from the asset and spend it directly, since a loan against that static asset will result in you spending your asset plus interest charges. If you have a good enough rate of return on your investment, you may actually be able to do this in perpetuity, taking out loan after loan, making the loan payments from the loan proceeds, while the value of your original asset pool continues to grow. At any given time, though, a severe downturn in the market could potentially leave you with large debts and insufficient value in your assets to back the debt. If that happens, you wont be getting another loan and the merrygoround will stop spinning. Its a bit of a Ponzi scheme, in a way. The U.S. government has done exactly this for a long time and has gotten away with it because the dollar has been the worlds reserve currency. You could always get a loan against the value of the U.S. currency in the past. Those days may be dwindling, with more countries choosing alternative currencies to conduct business with and the dollar becoming comparatively weaker into the foreseeable future. If you have savings, you can spend more than you make, which will put you into debt, then you can draw down your savings to pay that debt, and at the end of the month you will be out of debt, but have less in savings. You cannot do this forever. Eventually, you run out of savings. If you have no savings, you immediately go into debt and stay there when you spend more than you make. This is simple arithmetic. If you have no savings, but you own assets real estate, securities, a collection of neveropened Beatles vinyl records, a bicycle, then you could spend more than you make, and be in debt, but have the potential to liquidate assets to pay off all or part of the debt. This depends on finding a buyer and negotiating a price that helps you enough to make a real difference. If you have a car, and you owe 10 on it, but you can only find a buyer willing to pay 8 for the car, that doesnt help you unless you can refinance the 2 and your new payment amount is lower than the old payment amount. But then youre still 2 in debt on the car even though you no longer possess it, and youve still increased your debt by spending more than you made. If you stay on this path, sooner or later you will not have any assets left and you will be in debt, plain and simple. As a wrinkle in the concrete example, lets say you have stock options with your employer. This is a form of a \"call.\" You could also purchase a call through a broker in the stock market, or for a commodity in the futures market. That means you pay up front for the right to buy a specific amount of an asset at a fixed price usually with an expiration date. You dont own the stock, you just have the right to buy it at the call price, regardless of the current market value when you buy it. In the case of employee stock options, your upfront cost is in the form of a vesting schedule. You have to remain employed for a set time before a specific number of stocks become eligible for you to purchase at your option price the stocks \"vest\" on a certain date. Remain employed longer, and more stocks may vest, depending on your contract. If you quit or are terminated before that date, you forfeit your options. If you stick around through your vesting schedule, you pay real money to buy the stock at your option price. It only makes sense to do this if the market value of the stock is higher than your option price. If the current market value is lower than your option price, youre better off just buying the asset at the current market value, or waiting and hoping that the value increases before your contract expires. You could drive yourself into debt by spending more than you make, but still have a chance to eliminate your debt by exercising your calloption and then reselling the asset if it is worth more than what you pay for it. But you may have to wait for a vesting period to elapse before you can exercise your option depending on the nature of your contract. During this waiting period, you are in debt, and if you cant service your debt i.e. make payments acceptable to your creditors your things could get repossessed. Oh, dont forget that youll also pay a brokerage fee to sell the asset after you exercise your option. Further, if you have exhausted your savings and nobody will give you a loan to exercise your stock or futures options, then in the end you would be even further in debt because you already paid for the call, but you are unable to capitalize it and youll lose what you already paid. If you can get a loan to exercise your option, but youre a bad credit risk, chances are good that the lender will draft a contract requiring you to immediately pay back the loan proceeds plus a fee out of the proceeds of reselling the stock or other asset. In fact the lender might even draft a contract assigning ownership of your options to them, and stipulating that theyll pay you whats left after they subtract their fee. Even if you can get a traditional loan, you will pay interest over time. The end result is that your debt has still cost you very real money beyond the face value of the debt. Finally, if the asset for which you have a call has decreased in value lower than the current market value, you would be better off buying it directly in the market instead of exercising your option. But youll pay transaction fees to do that, and the entire action would be pure speculation or \"investment\", but not an immediate means to pay off your debt. Unless you have reliable insider trading information. But then you risk running afoul of the law. Frankly it might be better to get a loan to pay off your debt than to buy an \"investment\" hoping the value will increase, unless you could guarantee that the return on your investment would be bigger than the cumulative interest and late fees on your debt or the risk of repossession of your belongings. Remember that nothing you owe a debt on is actually yours, not your house, not your car, not your bicycle, not your smartphone. Most of the time, your best course of action is to make minimum payments on your lowestinterest debts and make extra payments on your highest interest debt, up to the highest total payment you can tolerate set something aside in a rainy day fund just in case. As you pay off the highestinterest debt, shift the amount you were paying on that debt to make extra payments on your next highestinterest debt until that one is paid off, and repeat on down the line until youre out of debt, then live within your means so that you dont find yourself working at McDonalds because you dont have a choice when youre in your 80s."

Even if your investment strategy makes money, earning what the SP 500 has averaged over multiple decades around 10 with an index fund means a lot more money than a 5 return with an actively managed portfolio especially when you consider factors like compound interest and inflation. I use the SP 500 as one of my criteria for judging how well or poorly my financial adviser is doing for me. If his recommendations or trading activity on my behalf, if authorized are inferior to the SP 500, for too long, then I have a basis to discontinue the relationship. Check out this Wikipedia entry on stock market indices. There are legitimate criticisms, but on the whole I think they are useful. As an aside, the reason I point to index funds specifically is that they are the one of the lowestcost, fireandforget investment strategies around. If you compare the return of the SP 500 index over multiple decades with most actively managed mutual funds, the SP 500 index comes out ahead."

    "topic": "How to sell a stock in a crashing market?",
    "content": "Your question contains a faulty assumption During crashes and corrections the amount of sellers is of course higher than the amount of buyers, making it difficult to sell stocks. This simply isnt true. Every trade has two sides thus, by definition, for every seller there is buyer and vice versa. Even if we broaden the definition of \"buyers\" and \"sellers\" to mean \"people willing to buy or sell at some price\", the assumption still isnt true. When a stock is falling it is generally not because potential buyers are exiting the market it is because they are revising the prices they are willing to buy at downward. For example, say there are a bunch of orders to buy Frobnitz Consolidated DUMB at 5. Suppose DUMB announces a downward revision to its earnings guidance. Those people might not be willing to buy at 50 anymore, so theyll probably cancel their 50 buy orders. However, just because DUMB isnt worth as much as they thought it was, that doesnt mean its completely worthless. So, those prospective buyers will likely enter new orders at some lower value, say, 45. With that, the value of DUMB has just dropped by 5, a 10 correction. However, there are still plenty of buyers, and you can still sell your DUMB holdings, if youre willing to take 45 for them. In other words, the value of a security is not determined by the relative numbers of buyers and sellers. It is determined by the prices those buyers and sellers are willing to pay to buy or accept to sell. Except for cases of massive IT disruptions, such as we saw in the \"flash crash\", there is always somebody willing to buy or sell at some price."

As the owner of a business you get hopefully business profits as well. And, in general, you often have other sources of income from investments, etc. Your estimated tax payments are based on the difference between what was withheld from your salary and what you will owe, based on salary, business income, and other sources. So, in essence, you just add up all the income you expect, estimate what the tax bill will be, and subtract whats been withheld. Thats your estimated tax payment."

    "content": "Prior to 1975, commissions for trading stock on the NYSE were fixed at 1 of the amount of the trade. In 1975, the SEC made fixed commission rates illegal, giving rise to discount brokers offering much reduced commission rates. Simultaneously, Electronic Communications Networks ECNs gained market share as alternative venues for executing trades. The increased competition led to further declines in commissions. Finally, as technology was widely adopted on Wall Street and human beings were largely taken out of the order execution process, commissions fell further. This had the effect of both drawing in new participants and increasing the rate of transactions of the existing participants see Day Trading, which was largely unheard of prior to the technology revolution of the 1990s. Most recently, the exchanges themselves have shifted their business model to depend on high frequency traders, and the proportion of trades accounted for by HFT firms ballooned from under 10 in the early 2000s to over 50 today."

    "content": "There are no \"online\" banks in Israel. There were various attempts to create something that would look like an online bank HaYashir HaRishon comes to mind, Mizrahi did something similar recently, but that essentially is a branch of a brick and mortar bank Leumi and Mizrahi, respectively that allows you online management and phone service instead of walking into a branch, not a replacement for a traditional bank. Thus there are no significant operational savings for the banks through which they could have afforded higher savings rates. I agree with the other responder that the banking system in Israel is very well regulated, but I agree with you also  it is not competitive at all. That said, at the current inflation rate and the current strength of the currency, the 2.02 that you have is actually pretty good. Israel has no interest in paying high rates on incoming money since its currency is too strong and it hurts exports, so dont expect much at home on this issue. Opening an account outside of Israel poses a different problem  tax reporting. Youll have to file an annual tax return and pay your taxes on the interest you earn, something most Israelis never have to do. That will cost you and will probably eat up much, if not all, of the gain. Also, currency fluctuations will hurt you, as noone will open an account in Shekels outside of Israel and youll have to convert back and forth. In fact, the first thing to happen when the rates in Israel go up would be for the currency to go down, so whatever you might gain abroad will disappear when you actually decide to move the money back. And you will still be taxed on the interest income cant deduct capital loss from interest income. Your options, as I see them, are either the stock market or the bonds market or, more likely, a mix. In Israel, the bonds similar to the US TBills short term bonds are called \"makam\" and you can either invest in them directly or through mutual funds. These are traded at TASE and can be held for free banks are not allowed to charge you for holding them. Theyre taxed at lower rates than capital gains 15 vs 25. During the times of low interest these may provide much better alternative than bank savings pakam."

    "content": "First of all, bear in mind that theres no such thing as a riskfree investment. If you keep your money in the bank, youll struggle to get a return that keeps up with inflation. The same is true for other \"safe\" investments like government bonds. Gold and silver are essentially completely speculative investments over the years their price tends to vary quite wildly, so unless you really understand how those markets work you should steer well clear. Theyre certainly not low risk. Repeatedly buying a property to sell in a couple of years time is almost certainly a bad idea youll end up paying substantial transaction fees each time that would wipe out a lot of the possible profit, and of course theres always the risk that prices would go down not up. Buying a property to keep  and preferably live in  might be a decent option once you have a good deposit saved up. Its very hard to say where prices will go in future, on the one hand London prices are very high by historical standards, but on the other hand supply is likely to remain severely constrained for years to come. I tend to think of a house as something that I need one of for the rest of my life, and so in one sense not owning a house to live in is a gamble that house prices and rents wont go up substantially. If you own a house, youre insulated from changes in rent etc and even if prices crash at least you still have somewhere to live. However that argument only works really well if you expect to keep living in the same area under most circumstances  house prices might crash in your area but not elsewhere."

    "content": "First In most cases when you inherit stocks the cost basis is stepped up to the date of the death of the person you inherited them from. So the capital gainloss is likely reset to zero. The rules vary a bit for joint accounts, but retirement accounts 401kROTH are considered individual accounts by the IRS. The rules on this have changed a lot in recent history, so it may depend on when he died. Update As JoeTaxpayer pointed out and I confirmed via this site , the gains are NOT stepped up for retirement accounts, so this is a moot point anyway. Further evidence that retirement accounts can be complicated and seeking professional guidance is a good idea. ...[T]here is no stepup in cost basis upon the death of the IRA owner. Most other assets owned by an individual receive a stepup in cost basis upon the death of the person, eliminating all capital gains on those assets up to that point in time. Second Even if you can deduct an investment capital loss, you can only deduct it to offset capital gains on another investments. Also you can only do this up to 3k per year, though you can roll over excess capital losses into future years. Bottom line I really doubt you are going to be able to claim a deduction. However, due to the complexity of the situation and the amount of money involved. I strongly suggest you talk to a qualified tax adviser and not rely solely on information you gather through this site."

    "topic": "Why not just invest in the market?",
    "content": "Let me start by giving you a snippet of a report that will floor you. Beat the market? Investors lag the market by so much that many call the industry a scam. This is the 2015 year end data from a report titled Quantitive Analysis of Investor Behavior by a firm, Dalbar. It boggles the mind that the disparity could be this bad. A mix of stocks and bonds over 30 years should average 8.5 or so. Take out fees, and even 7.5 would be the result I expect. The average investor return was less than half of this. Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard, and considered the father of the index fund, was ridiculed. A pamphlet I got from Vanguard decades ago quoted fund managers as saying that \"indexing is a path to mediocrity.\" Fortunately, I was a numbers guy, read all I could that Jack wrote and got most of that 10.35, less .05, down to .02 over the years. To answer the question psychology. People are easily scammed as they want to believe they can beat the market. Or that theyll somehow find a fund that does it for them. Im tempted to say ignorance or some other hint at lack of intelligence, but that would be unfair to the professionals, all of which were scammed by Madoff. Individual funds may not be scams, but investors are partly to blame, buy high, sell low, and you get the results above, I dare say, an investor claiming to use index funds might not fare much better than the 3.66 30 year return above, if they follow that path, buying high, selling low. Edit  I am adding this line to be clear  My conclusion, if any, is that the huge disparity cannot be attributed to management, a 6.7 lag from the SP return to what the average investor sees likely comes from bad trading. To the comments by Dave, we have a manager that consistently beats the market over any 23 year period. You have been with him 30 years and are clearly smiling about your relationship and investing decision. Yet, he still has flows in and out. People buy at the top when reading how good he is, and selling right after a 30 drop even when he actually beat by dropping just 22. By getting in and out, he has a set of clients with a 30 year record of 6 returns, while you have just over 11. This paragraph speaks to the behavior of the investor, not managed vs indexed."

    "content": "There are two things I can think of that might be different in other countries Until 2013, American Express, Visa and MasterCard prevented businesses from charging extra for credit card usage, and credit card surcharges still illegal in several states. Since credit card companies add a surcharge to credit card purchases, and merchants cant pass that onto credit card users, they just make everyone pay extra instead. Since everyone gets charged the credit card surcharge, you might as well use a credit card and recoup some of that via \"rewards\" points. Almost all credit cards here have grace periods, where you wont be charged interest if you pay back your loans in full within some period of time at least 21 days. This makes credit cards attractive to people who dont need a loan, but like the convenience that credit cards provide not carrying cash, extra insurance, better fraud protection. Apparently grace periods arent required by law here, so this might be common in other countries as well."

    "content": "Investors who are themselves Canadian and already hold Canadian dollars CAD would be more likely to purchase the TSXlisted shares that are quoted in CAD, thus avoiding the currency exchange fees that would be required to buy USDquoted shares listed on the NYSE. Assuming Shopify is only offering a single class of shares to the public in the IPO and Shopifys form F1 only mentions Class A subordinate voting shares as being offered then the shares that will trade on the TSX and NYSE will be the same class, i.e. identical. Consequently, the primary difference will be the currency in which they are quoted and trade. This adds another dimension to possible arbitrage, where not only the bare price could deviate between exchanges, but also due to currency fluctuation. An additional implication for a company to maintain such a dual listing is that theyll need to adhere to the requirements of both the TSX and NYSE. While this may have a hard cost in terms of additional filing requirements etc., in theory they will benefit from the additional liquidity provided by having the multiple listings. Canadians, in particular, are more likely to invest in a Canadian company when it has a TSX listing quoted in CAD. Also, for a company listed on both the TSX and NYSE, I would expect the TSX listing would be more likely to yield inclusion in a significant market indexsay, one based on market capitalization, and thus benefit the company by having its shares purchased by index ETFs and index mutual funds that track the index. Ill also remark that this dual U.S.Canadian exchange listing is not uncommon when it comes to Canadian companies that have significant business outside of Canada."

Once it matures, if there is nothing good to reinvest in, then it can go back into the offset mortgage. Once you have had money in the offset account, even if you take it out, you have already irreversibly saved money on your mortgage. Right now you would be pressed to find an instant access ISA with a rate higher than 1.5, so if you need immediate access, then the offset account seems good. On the other hand, for retirement, you might be saving longer term, and then you can get an ISA rate of 3, currently, which may be better for a part of the money or perhaps the upcoming Lifetime ISA with 25 yearly bonus may make sense for part of the money, if you do not need easy access to all of it.

Now for every new expiry they engage a long term commitment and it might take years for an option chain to be widely accepted and hence before theyre profitable. Compare the volumes and open interests of big chains versus the weeklies and youll find that weeklies can still be considered illiquid compared to their monthly cousins.

Or you could invest that money in the stock market, and get a lot more back.... and if thats too risky for you, just start a savings account and earn interest. And finally, in 30 years, the value of the dollar will be lower because of inflation, so it wont buy as much now as it will then. Thats the time value of money. Its the opportunity cost of the best of the things that you could have done with that money during the time it was gone. When you take out a loan, your interest payments will depend in part on the time value of the money youre borrowing the people making the loan could be investing that money somewhere else, like government bonds. It will also depend on factors like the risk of default on the loan  this is why credit card debt is more expensive than debt like a mortgage thats backed by a big fat asset like a house which can be seized and sold if you happen to default. This is how the Federal Reserve can affect interest rates across the economy by just buying or selling government bonds."

As I understand it there is a critical difference between supplying zerorated goodsservices and supplying exempt goodsservices. If the goodsservices are zerorated then the normal VAT rules apply, you charge VAT on your outputs at a rate of 0 and can claim back VAT on your inputs at whatever rate it was charged at, depending on the type of goods.. If the goodsservices are exempt you dont charge and VAT on your outputs and cant claim back any VAT on your inputs. Things get complicated if you have a mixture of exempt and nonexempt outputs According to httpoko.ukblogadsensevatexplained adsense income is a buisness to buisness transaction with a company in another EU country and so from a supplier point of view you are the supplier, google is the customer it counts as a zerorated transaction."

In actual fact the U.K. housing market is probably approaching a low, and you have a job that is paying you well enough. BUT the lesson I learned wasnt about buying at a high or a low, it was about the need never to let external factors rush your decision making. Your decisions have to make sense for your own unique situation. If youre living at home and you have domestic bliss, mum and dad arent crimping your style if you know what I mean, then, enjoy it. Your credit balance sounds understandable. Its not fatal. But its a budget killer. Make adjustments somehowanyhow so that you are paying it down month by month. Take it down to 0. You will feel amazing once you do it. After that, use the money that you were paying onto your credit card and start saving it. Whether you ultimately use the money for a house downpayment or your retirement, doesnt matter. Just get into the situation where youre saving."

    "content": "US checking accounts are not really secure, though many people use them. One form of check fraud has been highlighted by Prof. Donald Knuth and carried out by Frank Abagnale, as portrayed in the film Catch Me If You Can. Basically, anyone can write a check that would draw from your account merely by knowing your account number and your banks ABA routing number. With those two pieces of information which are revealed on every check that you write, anyone can print a working check, either using a laser printer with MICR magnetic ink character recognition toner, or by placing an order with a checkprinting company. The only other missing element is a signature, which is a pretty weak form of authentication. When presented with such a check, your bank would probably honor it before finding out, too late, that it is fraudulent. A variant of this vulnerability is ACH funds transfers. This is the mechanism through which you could have, say, your utility company automatically withdraw money from your account to pay your bill. Unfortunately, the transfer is initiated by the recipient, and the system relies largely on trust with some statistical monitoring for suspicious patterns. Basically, the whole US checking system is built with convenience rather than security in mind, since other institutions are able to initiate withdrawal transactions by knowing just the ABA number and account number. In practice, it works well enough for most people, but if you are paranoid about security, as you seem to be, you dont want to be using checks. The European system, which has largely eliminated checks in favor of payerinitiated push transactions, is safer by design."

Others have answered why a company may or may not pay a dividend, but I think glossed over the central question. A stock has value because it is ownership of a piece of the company. The company itself has value, in the form of You get the idea. A companys value is based on things it owns or things that can be monetized. By extension, a share is a piece of all that. Some of these things dont have clear cut values, and this can result in differing opinions on what a company is worth.

    "content": "This entirely depends on two factors Now lets look at what AppleCare gives you What it covers is any manufacturing defect. It also covers you for phone support, as otherwise its a 49perincident charge even for simple issues. It also covers any software issues that you may come across as long as the issues pertain to Apple software or the operating system itself. What it doesnt cover is any damage caused by the user. If you snap the corner of the screen, drop it, spill liquid on it, modify it, etc... then youre responsible for paying the repair costs. If youre outside of phone support, then youre going to have to pay someone to fix any problems you come across. Now if were to trust this handy study done in 2009, then we can say that the 3year failure rate for Macbooks and Macbook Pros is 17.4. We could go ahead and say that 350  2000  17.5 so the chances match up, but whats the likelihood that Apple is going to cover the full 2000? Only under extreme cases are you losing the full 2000 theft, shock damage, etc..., and those are all cases that Apple wont cover anyways. Instead were looking at cases such as Please keep in mind it has been several years since I worked for Apple, so these figures may be off So this reduces our possible savings significantly. Lets then also look at what the warranty becomes after they fixed a part A replacement part or Apple Product, including a userinstallable part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by Apple, assumes the remaining term of the Warranty or ninety 90 days from the date of replacement or repair, whichever provides longer coverage for you. Which means in this case that you have a 90day warranty after theyve fixed an issue. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a same part going bad multiple times in a row. Therefore the chances of that 350 being worthwhile are very much against you. Even if the system does fail in some way, it is likely that the repair would be cheaper than the AppleCare. The chances of running into a repair or series of repairs that pays for the AppleCare and then some are astonishingly low. I would still get it if you were giving it to someone who was significantly lacking in any technology concepts such as a parent or grandparent as they are more likely to utilize the extended phone support, especially for smaller things that they might nag you about!"

    "topic": "Would open source credit score formulas be feasible?",
    "content": "The major bureaus use the Fair Isaac scoring model, for the most part. Heres an excerpt from a web site Versions of the FICO scoring model to explain One of the first things a newcomer to this board learns is the difference between FICO and FAKO scores. FAKO refers to the nonFICO scores offered by various companies. FAKO scores have little value since few of them are used by lenders and they do not match closely to FICO scores. But even when you stick with FICO scores, confusion can ensue because FICO scores have many different editions, versions, and variations. On a single day, a consumer could theoretically have dozens of different FICO scores, depending on which version and credit agency is used to produce the score. This post provides a summary of the various FICO versions. Please offer any corrections or updates, and they will be edited in. The FICO scoring model with its familiar range of 300 to 850 was first introduced in 1989. Since then, FICO has released five major revisions 1995, 1998, 2004, 2008, and 2014. Each \"edition\" uses a different formula and produces a different score. When a new FICO edition is released, many lenders continue using an older version for years before \"upgrading.\" The 1995 revision is no longer in common use, but later editions are still used by lenders. Most FICO editions are commonly known by the year of introduction FICO 98, FICO 04, and FICO 08 although FICO now calls it FICO Score 8, without the zero. The most recent edition is FICO Score 9 introduced in 2014. As of 2014, FICO Score 8 is the most commonly used. However, most mortgage lenders use FICO 04 for Equifax and Transunion, and FICO 98 for Experian. In addition to the \"classic\" version, FICO offers \"Industry Option\" versions customized for auto loans, credit cards, installment loans, personal finance loans, and insurance. These have a score range of 250 to 900, so the scores are not fully comparable with \"classic\" versions. As of 2015, Auto and Bankcard scores are available from myFICO as described here. Citibank provides the Equifax FICO 8 Bankcard score free each month to credit cards holders. Each credit agency Transunion, Equifax, and Experian uses a customized version of each FICO edition. As a result, a consumers FICO scores from each agency may differ even when all credit information is identical among the agencies. Because there are many FICO versions, when a score is received, its helpful to know which version it is. If a lender provides a credit score, ask for details such as which credit agency was used, which FICO edition was used, and whether the score is an Industry Option version. The lender may not always be willing or able to provide the answers, but it doesnt hurt to ask. Transunion Official name FICO Risk Score Classic 98 Common name TU98 Available directly to consumers No Realworld score range 336 to 843 as shown on page 16 of this Transunion document Equifax Official name Equifax FICO Score 4 also known as Equifax Beacon 96 Common name EQ98 This version appears to be seldom used, but a poster reported it used on a mortgage application in 2014.

Realworld score range 316 to 850 as shown on this Experian document How FICO Score 8 differs from previous versions is explained here. In May 2014, a poster named android01 received 850 scores from all three credit agencies, as described in this post. In June 2014, a poster named fused received 850 scores from all three credit agencies, as described in this post. This 2011 press release describes a study of FICO Score 8 scores. From a sample of 250,000 credit reports, it found 0.02 had a score of 850, or about 1 out of every 5000 persons. In 2014, FICO announced a new version called FICO Score 9. More info here. As of February 2016, the score is now available directly to consumers, as described here. This New York Times article says FICO 9 includes two important changes unpaid debts that result in collection actions will no longer have a negative effect on a score if the debt has been paid. unpaid medical debts will have less negative effect on scores. In 2001, FICO released a new scoring model called NextGen. It is claimed to be an improvement over \"classic\" FICO models because it tracks more factors. But it has failed to catch on with lenders because its score range of 150 to 950 is incompatible with the familiar 300 to 850 range, requiring lenders to recalculate cutoff scores and revise many rules and policies. Only a small percentage of lenders reportedly use NextGen. Transunion Official name Precision Available directly to consumers No Equifax Official name Pinnacle Available directly to consumers In 2014, Pentagon Federal Credit Union PenFed began to provide this score free to its credit card holders, as discussed in this post. Experian Official name FICO Advanced Risk Score Available directly to consumers No I included all of this to make the point that there are many variations of the scoring models, and all of them are customized to one degree or another by each of the major bureaus as a means of giving their models more credibility, as far as theyre concerned. To your question about coming up with a \"fair\" scoring model, can you propose what makes current scoring models unfair? I think its a safe assumption to make that the financial community has already had a substantial amount of input into how the current scoring models work. To think otherwise implies that the credit bureaus are just kinda \"winging it\" with whatever they think is best. Their models are designed to give their client creditors the best scoring model possible based on what those creditors have stated is important to them. There isnt a unified single scoring model out there, and the bureaus definitely wont share the details of their modifications. You can always come up with your own custom model, but how it compares to whats widely used, thats anyones guess. I hope this helps. Good luck!"

    "content": "Now, if Im not mistaken, tracking a valueweighted index is extremely easy  just buy the shares in the exact amount they are in the index and wait. Yes in theory. In practise this is difficult. Most funds that track SP do it on sample basis. This is to maintain the fund size. Although I dont have  know the exact number ... if one wants to replicate the 500 stocks in the same , one would need close to billion in fund size. As funds are not this large, there are various strategies adopted, including sampling of companies [i.e. dont buy all] select a set of companies that mimic the SP behaviour, etc. All these strategies result in tracking errors. There are algorithms to reduce this. The only time you would need to rebalance your holdings is when there is a change in the index, i.e. a company is dropped and a new one is added, right? So essentially rebalance is done to If so, why do passive ETFs require frequent rebalancing and generally lose to their benchmark index? lets take an Index with just 3 companies, with below price. The total Market cap is 1000 The Minimum required to mimic this index is 200 or Multiples of 200. If so you are fine. More Often, funds cant be this large. For example approx 100 funds track the SP Index. Together they hold around 810 of Market Cap. Few large funds like Vangaurd, etc may hold around 2. But most of the 100 SP funds hold something in 0.1 to 0.5 range. So lets say a fund only has 100. To maintain same proportion it has to buy shares in fraction. But it can only buy shares in whole numbers. This would then force the fund manager to allocate out of proportion, some may remain cash, etc. As you can see below illustrative, there is a tracking error. The fund is not truly able to mimic the index. Now lets say after 1st April, the share price moved, now this would mean more tracking error if no action is taken [block 2] ... and less tracking error if one share of company B is sold and one share of company C is purchased. Again the above is a very simplified view. Tracking error computation is involved mathematics. Now that we have the basic concepts, more often funds tracking SP Thus they need to rebalance."

    "content": "It sounds to me like you may not be defining fundamental investing very well, which is why it may seem like it doesnt matter. Fundamental investing means valuing a stock based on your estimate of its future profitability and thus cash flows and dividends. One way to do this is to look at the multiples you have described. But multiples are inherently backwardlooking so for firms with good growth prospects, they can be very poor estimates of future profitability. When you see a firm with ratios way out of whack with other firms, you can conclude that the market thinks that firm has a lot of future growth possibilities. Thats all. It could be that the market is overestimating that growth, but you would need more information in order to conclude that. We call Warren Buffet a fundamental investor because he tends to think the market has made a mistake and overvalued many firms with crazy ratios. That may be in many cases, but it doesnt necessarily mean those investors are not using fundamental analysis to come up with their valuations. Fundamental investing is still very much relevant and is probably the primary determinant of stock prices. Its just that fundamental investing encompasses estimating things like future growth and innovation, which is a lot more than just looking at the ratios you have described."

There are people from Canada, US, and many other countries here so \"mutual funds\" that mean one thing to you may be a bit different for someone in a foreign country for one point. Thanks for stating that point in a tag. Second, mutual funds are merely a type of investment vehicle, there is something to be said for what is in the fund which could be an investment company, trust or a few other possibilities. Within North America there are money market mutual funds, bond mutual funds, stock mutual funds, mutual funds of other mutual funds and funds that are a combination of any and all of the former choices. Thus, something like a money market mutual fund would be low risk but quite likely low return as well. Shortterm bond funds would bring up the risk a tick though this depends on how you handle the volatility of the funds NAV changing. There is also something to be said for openend, ETF and closedend funds that are a few types to consider as well. Third, taxes are something not even mentioned here which could impact which kinds of funds make sense as some funds may invest in instruments with favorable taxtreatment. Aside from funds, Id look at CDs and Treasuries would be my suggestion. With a rather short time frame, stocks could be quite dangerous to my mind. Id only suggest stocks if you are investing for at least 5 years. In 2 years there is a lot that can happen with stocks where if you look at history there was a record of stocks going down about 1 in every 4 years on average. Something to consider is what kind of downside would you accept here? Are you OK if what you save gets cut in half? This is what can happen with some growth funds in the shortterm which is what a 2 year time horizon looks like. If you do with a stock mutual fund, it would be a gamble to my mind.

Ive always been a bit surprised when people ascribe some sort of sixth sense to Warren Buffets success. He just works hard and doesnt deviate from a sound strategy. \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\" And of course, rule one \"Dont lose money.\" Its not a joke. How many people buy high and sell low because of fear and greed? When the market tanks, buy more. Finally, anyone can invest with Buffet without all the work.

If I knew the maturity date, or current yield to maturity Id be able to calculate the other number and advise how much rates need to rise to cause the value to drop from 18 to 17. For a 10 year bond, a rise today of .1 will cause the bond to drop about 1 in value. This is a back of napkin calculation, finance calculators offer precision. edit  when I calculate present value with 34 years to go, and 5.832 yield to maturity, I get 14.55. At 5.932, the value drops to 14.09, a drop of 3.1. Edit  Geo asked me to show calculations. Here it goes  A The simplest way to calculate present value for a zero coupon bond is to take the rate 5.832, convert it to 1.05832 and divide into the face value, 100. I offer this as the \"four function calculator\" approach, so one enters 100 divided by 1.05832 and repeat for the number of years left. A bit of precision is lost if theres a fractional year involved, but its close. The bidask will be wider than this error introduced. B Next  If youve never read my open declaration of love for my Texas Instruments BA35 calculator, here it is, again. One enters N34 for the years FV  100, Rate  5.832, and then CPT PV. It will give the result, 14.56. C Here is how to do it in Excel  The numbers in lines 13 are self evident, the equation in cell B4 is PVB3100,B1,0,B2  please note there are tiny differences in the way to calculate in excel vs a calculator. Excel wants the rate to be .05832, so I divided by 100 in the equation cell. Thats the best 3 ways I know to calculate present value. Geo, if youve not noticed, the time value of money is near and dear to me. It comes into play for bonds, mortgages, and many aspect of investing. The equations get more complex if there are payments each year, but both the BA35 and excel are up to it."

    "topic": "Currency exchange problem",
    "content": "For the purposes of report generation, I would recommend that you present the data in the currency of the users home country. You could present another indicator, if needed, to indicate that a specific transaction was denominated in a foreign currency, where the amount represents the value of the foreigndenominated transaction in the users home country Currency. For example Airfare from USA to London 1,000.00 Taxi from airport to hotel 100.00 in  In terms of your database design, I would recommend not storing the data in any one denomination or reference currency. This would require you to do many more conversions between currencies that is likely to be necessary, and will create additional complexity where in some cases, you will need to do multiple conversions per transaction in and out of your reference currency. I think it will be easier for you to store multiple currencies as themselves, and not in a separate reference currency. I would recommend storing several pieces of information separately for each transaction This way, you can create a calculated Amount for each transaction that is not in the users \"home\" currency, whereas you would need to calculate this for all transactions if you used a universal reference currency. You could also get data from an external source if the user has forgotten the conversion rate. Remember that there are always fees and variations in the exchange rate that a user will get for their home countrys currency, even if they change money at the same place at two different times on the same day. As a result, I would recommend building in a simple form that allows a user to enter how much they exchanged and how much they got back to calculate the exchange rate. So for example, lets say I have  200.00 USD and I exchanged  100.00 USD for  60.00, and there was a  3.00 fee for the exchange. The exchange rate would be 0.6, and when the user enters a currency conversion, your site could create three separate transactions such as USD Converted to  100.00  Received from Exchange  60.00 Exchange Fee  3.00 So if the user exchanged currency and then ran a balance report by Currency, you could either show them that they now have  100.00 USD and  57.00, or you could alternatively choose to show the  57.00 that they have as 95.00 USD instead. If you were showing them a transaction report, you could also show the fee denominated in dollars as well. I would recommend storing your balances and transactions in their own currencies, as you will run into some very interesting problems otherwise. For example, lets say you used a reference currency tied to the dollar. So one day I exchange  100.00 USD for  60.00. In this system I would still have 100 of my reference currency. However, if the next day, the exchange rate falls and  1.00 USD is only worth  0.55, and I change my  60.00 back into USD, I will get approxiamately  109.09 USD back for my  60.00. If I then go and buy something for  100.00 USD, the balance of the reference currency would be at 0, but I will still have  9.09 USD in my pocket as a result of the fluctuating currency values! That is why Id recommend storing currencies as themselves, and only showing them in another currency for convenience using calculations done \"on the fly\" at report runtime. Best of luck with your site!"

Conversely zillions in \"cash settled\" contracts play out each day. Both are totally commonplace. Different businesses or entities or traders would use the two \"varieties\" for sundry reasons. The different exchanges offer the different varieties, ultimately I guess because they happen to think that niche will be profitable. Theres no \"galactic council\" or something that enforces which mode of settlement is available on a given offering  ! Recall that \"a given futures contracts market\" is nothing more than a product offered by a certain exchange company just like Burger King sells different products. I believe in another aspect of the question, OP is asking basically \"Why is there not, a futures contract, of the mini or micro variety for extremely small amounts, of currency futures, which, is physically settled rather than cash settled ..?\" If thats the question the answer is just \"whatever, nobodys done it yet\".

The third column is the category Ive assigned in my spreadsheet  its how I manage my rebalancing among different classes. \"USLC\" is large cap, MC is mid cap, SC is small cap. \"IntlDev\" is international stocks from developed economies, \"Emer\" is emerging economies. These have some overlap. I dont have a specific way to handle this, I just keep an eye on the overall picture. E.g. I dont overdo it on, say, BRIC  Brazil or SPY  SP500 Growth. The main reason for each selection is that they provide exposure to a certain batch of securities that I was looking for. In each type, I was also aiming for cheap andor liquid like you. If there are substitutes I should be looking at for any of these that are cheaper andor more liquid, a comment would be great. High Volume Mid Volume 1mil sharesday Low Volume 50k sharesday These provide enough variety to cover the target allocation below. That allocation is just for retirement accounts I dont consider any other savings when I rebalance against this allocation. When its time to rebalance i.e. a couple of times a year when I realize that I havent done it in several months, I update quotes, look at the percentages assigned to each category, and if anything is off the target by more than 1 point I will buysell to adjust. I.e. if USLC is 23, I sell enough to get back to 20, then use the cash to buy more of something else that is under the target. But if USMC is 7.2 I dont worry about it. The 1 threshold prevents unnecessary trading costs sometimes if everything is just over 1 off Ill let it slide. I generally try to stay away from timing, but I do use some of that extra cash when theres a panic after JanFeb 09 I had very little cash in the retirement accounts. I dont have the source for this allocation any more, but it is the result of combining a half dozen or so sample allocations that I saw and tailoring it for my goals."

Good luck achieving the 10 return, and in knowing your mortality down to the exact year. Unless this is a homework assignment, which need not reflect real life. Edit  as indicated above, the first step is to get that value in 20 years The image is the userfriendly entry screen for the PV calculation. It walks you though the need to enter rate as per period, therefore I enter .112 as the rate. The payment you desire is 50Kyr, and since its a payment, its a negative number. The equation in excel that results is PV0.112,240,5000012,0 and the sum calculated is 431,769 Next you wish to know the payments to make to arrive at this number In this case, you start at zero PV with a known FV calculated above, and known rate. This solves for the payment needed to get this number, 568.59 The excel equation is PMT0.112,240,0,431769 Most people have access to excel or a public domain spreadsheet application e.g. Openoffice. If you are often needing to perform such calculations, a business finance calculator is recommended. TI used to make a model BA35 finance calculator, no longer in production, still on eBay, used. One more update these equations whether in excel or a calculator are geared toward per period interest, i.e. when you state 10, they assume a monthly 1012.

The equation to calculate deposit required becomes  4166.671.00833333240 568.59 HA! Exact same answer, far less work.

You said that all you need to do is beat the 0.9 interest rate with your investment to come out ahead. That doesnt take into account the discount you would have gotten by paying cash. 30,000 invested for 5 years at 1.6 rough estimate would get you 2,500 the discount, so the rate you need to beat to come out ahead is actually 2.5. Still doable, but it is much less of a sure thing on a 5 year investment, and much less worth the trouble. New cars are an expensive luxury. If you are wealthy enough, a new car certainly can be appropriate for you. However, if you dont like the idea of paying 30k in cash all at once, that is a strong indication that perhaps the new car is a luxury you arent in a position to buy at this time.

It seems like a good place to start would be an index fund, which invests in the general stock market. When the gold market falls, this would mainly affect gold mining companies. These do not make up a sizable portion of any index fund, which is invested broadly in the market. Unfortunately, in order to act on this, you would also have to believe that the stock market was a good investment. To test this theory, I looked at an ETF index fund which tracks the SP 500, and compared it to an ETF which invests in gold. I found that the daily price movements of the stock market were positively correlated with the price of gold. This result was statistically significant. The weekly price movements of the stock market were also correlated with the price of gold. This result was also statistically significant. When the holding period was stretched to one month, there was still a positive relationship between the stock markets price moves and the price of gold. This result was not statistically significant. When the holding period was stretched to one year, there was a negative relationship between the price changes in the stock market and the price of gold.

    "topic": "Is 401k as good as it sounds given the way it is taxed?",
    "content": "Dont forget inflation. With a Roth 401k or IRA, you dont pay any taxes on inflationary or real gains. You pay taxes at the beginning and then no more taxes unless you invest money after you distributed from it. With a regular, taxable investment account not a 401k or IRA, you pay taxes on the initial amount. And then you pay taxes on the gains, both inflationary and real. So you effectively pay taxes on the inflated principal twice. Once at initial earning and once when it shows up as inflationary gains. Ill give an example later. With a traditional 401k or IRA, you pay no taxes on the initial amount. You pay taxes on the distributed amount. That includes taxes on gains, but it only taxes them once, not twice. All the taxes are paid at distribution time. Heres a semirealistic example. This is not a real example with real numbers, but the numbers shouldnt be ridiculously off. They could happen. Im going to ignore variation and pretend that all the numbers will be the same each year so as to simplify the math. So you pay a 25 marginal tax rate and want to invest 12,000 plus any tax savings. Roth 12,000 principal Traditional IRA Trad 16,000 principal with 4000 in tax savings Taxable Investment Account TIA 12,000 principal Lets assume that you make an 8 rate of return and inflation is 3. Both numbers are possible, although higher and lower numbers have occurred in the past. That gives you returns of 960 for the Roth and TIA cases and a return of 1280 for the Trad case. Pay no annual taxes on the Roth or Trad cases. Pay 25 marginal tax on the TIA case, thats 240. Balances after one year Roth 12,960 Trad 17,280 TIA 12,720 Inflation decreases the value of the Roth and TIA cases by 360 in the Roth and TIA cases. And by 480 in the Trad case. Ten years of inflationary gains cumulative Roth 5354 Trad 7138 TIA 4872 Net buildup including inflationary gains Roth 25,907 Trad 34,543 TIA 23,168 Real value minus inflation to maintain spending power Roth 20,554 Trad 27,405 TIA 18,109 Now take out 3000 per year, after taxes. Thats 3000 in the the Roth and TIA cases, as you already paid the taxes. In the Trad case, thats 4000 because you have to pay 25 tax which will cost 1000. Do that for five years and the new balances are Roth 9931 Trad 13,241 TIA 5973 The TIA will run out in the 8th year. The Roth and Trad will both run out in the 9th year. So to summarize. The Traditional IRA initially grows the most. The TIA grows the least. The TIA is taxadvantaged over the Traditional IRA at that point, but it still runs out first. The Roth IRA grows about the same as the Traditional after taxes are included. Note that I left out the matching contribution from a 401k. That would help both those options. I assumed that the marginal tax rate would be 25 on the Traditional IRA distributions. It might be only 15, which would increase the advantage of the Traditional IRA. I assumed that the 15 rate on capital returns would still be true for the entire period. If that is increased, the TIA option gets a lot worse. Inflation could be higher or lower. As stated earlier, the TIA account is hit the worst by inflation."

Lets say they pay the 60 [either to you or to the seller] The title is still with Seller as full payment is not made. Now if you default, the Bank has no recourse against the seller [who still owns the title] and you are not paying. Some Banks may allow a schedule where the 6040 may be applied to every payment made.

The lending company is offering you 1.1 million assuming that you are paying 700K and the title will be yours. This would safeguard the Banks interest. Now if you default, the Bank can take possession of the house and recover the funds, a distress sale may be mean the house goes for less than 1.8 M say for 1.4 million. The Bank would take back the 1.1 million plus interest and other closing costs. So if you can close the deal by paying only 20, Bank would ask you to close this first and then lend you any money.

    "topic": "When investing, is the riskreward tradeoff linear?",
    "content": "Ditto Bill and I upvoted his answer. But let me add a bit. If everyone knew exactly what the risk was for every investment, then prices would be bid up or down until every stock or bond or derivative or whatever was valued at exactly risk times potential profit. Or more precisely, integral of risk times potential profit. If company A was 100 guaranteed to make 1 million profit this year, while company B had 50 change to make a 2 million profit and 50 to make 0, and every investor in the world knew that, then Id expect the total price of all shares of the two stocks to stabilize at the same value. The catch to that, though, is that no one really knows the risk. The risk isnt like, were going to roll a die and if it comes up even the company makes 1 million and if it comes up odd the company makes 0, so we could calculate the exact probability. The risk comes from lack of information. Will consumers want to buy this new product? How many? What are they willing to pay? How capable is the new CEO? Etc. Its very hard to calculate probabilities on these things. How can you precisely calculate the probability that unforeseen events will occur? So in real life prices are muddled. The riskreward ratio should be roughly sort of approximately linear, but thats about the most one can say."

    "content": "This is the sad state of US stock markets and Regulation T. Yes, while options have cleared  settled for t1 trade 1 day for years and now actually clear \"instantly\" on some exchanges, stocks still clear  settle in t3. There really is no excuse for it. If you are in a margin account, regulations permit the trading of unsettled funds without affecting margin requirements, so your funds in effect are available immediately after trading but arent considered margin loans. Some strict brokers will even restrict the amount of uncleared margin funds you can trade with Scottrade used to be hyper safe and was the only online discount broker that did this years ago others will allow you to withdraw a large percentage of your funds immediately I think ETrade lets you withdraw up to 90 of unsettled funds immediately. If you are in a cash account, you are authorized to buy with unsettled funds, but you cant sell purchases made on unsettled funds until such funds clear, or youll be barred for 90 days from trading as your letter threatened besides, most brokers dont allow this. You certainly arent allowed to withdraw unsettled funds by your broker in such an account as it would technically constitute a loan for which you arent even liable since youve agreed to no loan contract, a margin agreement. I cant be sure if that actually violates Reg T, but when I am, Ill edit. While it is true that all marketable options are cleared through one central entity, the Options Clearing Corporation, with stocks, clearing  settling still occurs between brokers, netting their transactions between each other electronically. All financial products could clear  settle immediately imo, and Id rather not start a firestorm by giving my opinion why not. Dont even get me started on the bond market... As to the actual process, its called \"clearing  settling\". The general process which can generally be applied to all financial instruments from cash deposits to derivatives trading is The reason why all of the old financial companies were grouped on Wall St. is because theyd have runners physically carting all of the certificates from building to building. Then, they discovered netting so slowed down the process to balance the accounts and only cart the net amounts of certificates they owed each other. This is how we get the term \"bankers hours\" where financial firms would close to the public early to account for the days trading. While this is all really done instantly behind your back at your broker, theyve conveniently kept the short hours."

This Investorplace article on the subject describes what youre seeing, and recommends the strategy youre describing precisely. Instead of a market order, take advantage of the fact that the options world truly is a marketplace  one where you can possibly get a better price just by asking. How does that work? If you use a limit order instead of a market order when opening a position, you can tell your broker how much you are willing to pay to enter a trade. For example, if you enter a limit price of 1.15, you can see whether the marketmaker will bite. You will be surprised at how many times you will get your price i.e., 1.15 instead of the ask price of 1.30. If your order at 1.15 is not filled after a few minutes, you can modify your order and pay the ask price by entering a market order or limit order at the ask price that is, you can tell your broker to pay no more than 1.30."

They show that theres a tradeoff between liquidating your portfolio faster and knowing the value with more certainty, versus liquidating more slowly and likely for a higher price but with less certainty. So for example, if you sold your entire position right now, you would know almost certainly how much you would get for the position. Or, you could sell off your position more slowly, and likely get more money, but you would have less certainty about how much you would get.

His point is that, due to low inflation, the returns on almost all asset classes should be less than they have been historically, so we shouldnt rebalance our portfolio or withdraw from the market and hold cash based on the assumption that stocks or any other asset seem to be underperforming relative to historical trends. His last paragraph is written in case someone might misunderstand him, he is not advocating to hold cash, just that investors should not expect as good returns as has happened historically, since those happened in higher inflation environments. To explain If the inflation rate historically has been 5 and now its 2, and the riskfreemarket return should be about 2, then historically the return on a riskfree asset would be 7 25, and now it should be expected to be 4 22. So, if you have had a portfolio over some time you might be concerned that the rate of return is worsening, but Simons point is that before you sell off your stocks  switch investment brokers, you should try to figure out if inflation is the cause of the performance loss. On the subject of cash cash always loses value over time from inflation, since inflation is a measure of the increase in prices over time its a part of the definition of what inflation is. That said, cash holdings lose value more slowly when inflation is lower, so they are relatively less worse than before. The future value of cash doesnt go up in low inflation youd need deflation for that, it just decreases at a lower rate, that is, it becomes less expensive to hold but there still is a price. As an addendum, unless a completely new economic paradigm is adopted by world leaders, we will always see cash holdings decrease in value over time, since modern economics holds that deflation is one of the worst things that can happen to an economy."

    "topic": "What is a reasonable salary for the owner and sole member of a small SCorp?",
    "content": "The answer depends on this If you had to hire someone to do what you are doing in the Scorp, what would you pay them? If you are doing semiunskilled work parttime, then 20k might be reasonable. If you are a professional working full time, its too low. Dont forget that, in addition to \"billable\" work, you are also doing office tasks, such as invoicing and bookkeeping, that the IRS will also want to see you getting paid for. There was an important court ruling on this subject recently Watson v. Commissioner. Watson owned an SCorp where he was the sole employee. The SCorp itself was a 25 owner in a very successful accounting firm that Watson worked through. All of the revenue that Watson generated at the accounting firm was paid to the SCorp, which then paid Watson through salary and distributions. Watson was paying himself 24k a year in salary and taking over 175k a year in distributions. For comparison, even firstyear accountants at the firm were making more than 24k a year in salary. The IRS determined that this salary amount was too low. To determine an appropriate amount for Watsons salary, the IRS did a study of the salaries of peers in firms of the same size as the firm Watson was working with, taking into account that owners of firms earn a higher salary than nonowners. The number that the IRS arrived at was 93k. Watson was allowed to take the rest 80k each year as distributions. Again, this number was based on a study of the salaries of peers. It was far short of the 200k that the SCorp was pulling in from the accounting firm. Clearly, Watson was paying himself far too low of a salary. But even at this extreme example, where Watsons SCorp was directly getting all of its revenue from one accounting firm in which Watson was an owner, the IRS still did not conclude that all of the revenue should have been salary and subject to payroll taxes. You should ask an accountant or attorney for advice. They can help you determine an appropriate amount for your salary. Dont be afraid of an audit, but make sure that you can defend your choices if you do get audited. If your choices are based on professional advice, that will help your case.

If you instead do something like, look at what Warren Buffets fund boughtsold yesterday or even 60 minutes ago, and buysell it yourself, you will face 2 obstacles to achieving their returns 1 The timing difference will mean that the value of the stock purchased by Warren Buffet will be different for your purchase and for his purchase. Because these investors often buy large swathes of stock at once, this may create large variances for 2 reasons a simply buying a large volume of a stock will naturally increase the price, as the lowest sell orders are taken up, and fewer willing sellers remain and b many people including institutional investors may be watching what someone like Warren Buffet does, and will want to follow suit, chasing the same pricing problem. 2 You cannot buy multiple stocks as efficiently as a fund can. If Warren Buffets fund holds, say, 50 stocks, and he trades 1 stock per day [I have absolutely no idea about what diversification exists within his fund], his pershare transaction costs will be quite low, due to share volume. Whereas for you to follow him, you would need 50 transactions upfront,  1 per day. This may appear to be a small cost, but it could be substantial. Imagine if you wanted to invest 50k using this method  thats 1k for each of 50 companies. A 5 transaction fee would equal 1 of the value of each company invested [5 to buy, and 5 to sell]. How does that 1 compare to the management fee charged by the actual fund available to you? In short, if you feel that a particular investor has a sound strategy, I suggest that you consider investing with them directly, instead of attempting to recreate their portfolio."

    "content": "An option gives you the option rather than the obligation to buy or sell the underlying so you dont have to exercise you can just let the option expire so long it doesnt have an automatic expiry. After expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover. Option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays. An option has two values associated with it time value and exercise value. Far out of the money when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side options only have time value whereas deep in the money options as yours seems to be has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy sell at a low high price and then sell buy the underlying. The time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move further in your favour and make you more money at expiry. As expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no revaluing. Up to now what I have said applies to both OTC and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower. On the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price, on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds. If these are European style options which sounds likely and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money. Their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money. They have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying. If I am not correct in my excise style assumption European I may need more details on the trade as it seems like you should just exercise now and take the profit if it is that far into the money."

    "content": "To add to michaels solid answer, I would suggest sitting down and analyzing what your priorities are about paying off the student loan debt versus investing that money immediately. Regardless, the first thing you should do is, as michael suggested, pay off the credit card debt Since it looks like you will be having some new expenses coming up soon rent, possibly a new car, as part of that prioritization you should calculate what your rent and associated bills will cost you on a monthly basis including saving a bit each month! and see if you can afford to pay everything without incurring new debt. Id recommend trying to come up with several scenarios to see how cheaply you can live roommates, maybe you can figure out a way to go without a car, etc. If, for whatever reason, you find you cant afford everything, then I would suggest taking a portion of your inheritance to at least pay off enough of your student loans so that you can afford all of your costs per month, and then save or invest the rest. You can invest all you like, but if you dont live within your means, it wont do you any good. Finally  be aware that you may have other factors that come into play that may override financial considerations. I found myself in a situation similar to yours, and in my case, I chose to pay off my debts, not because it necessarily made the best financial sense, but that because of those other considerations, paying off that debt meant I had a significant level of stress removed from my life, and a lot more peace of mind."

Having said that, we are currently in a mature bull market having experienced over seven years without encountering a bear market.

    "content": "As a TLDR version of JAGAnalysts excellent answer the buying company doesnt need every last share all they need is to get 51 of the voting bloc to agree to the merger, and to vote that way at a shareholder meeting. Or, if they can get a supermajority 90 in the US, they dont even need a vote. Usually, a buying companys first option is a \"friendly merger\" they approach the board of directors or the direct owners of a private company and make a \"tender offer\" to buy the company by purchasing their controlling interest. The board, if they find the offer attractive enough, will agree, and usually their support or the outright sale of shares will get the company the 51 they need. Failing the first option, the buying companys next strategy is to make the same tender offer on the open market. This must be a public declaration and there must be time for the market to absorb the news before the company can begin purchasing shares on the open market. The goal is to acquire 51 of the total shares in existence. Not 51 of market cap thats the number or value of shares offered for public trading. You could buy 100 of Facebooks market cap and not be anywhere close to a majority holding Zuckerberg himself owns 51 of the company, and other VCs still have closelyheld shares not available for public trading. That means that a company that doesnt have 51 of its shares on the open market is pretty much unbuyable without getting at least some of those private shareholders to cash out. But, thats actually pretty rare some of your larger multinationals may have as little as 10 of their equity in the hands of the upper management who would be trying to resist such a takeover.

When the card is physically present and the charge is low, the burden of keeping the signed receipts and of additional delays at the cash register is not worth the potential risk of fraud.

In one supermarket in the area I live they require signatures only on charges above 50. In another, 10 miles away from the first one, they require signatures on charges above 25."

There are pitfalls in communicating with them which restart the clock on bad debt aging off the credit report, and which can be used to say that you agreed to pay a debt. For instance, if you make any sort of payment on any debt, a case can be made that you have assumed the debt. Once you are aware of the pitfalls, contact the collection agency in writing and dispute the debt. Force them to prove that it is your debt. Force them to prove that they have the right to collect it. Force them to prove the amount. Dispute the fairness of the amount. Doubling your principal in 6 years is a bit flagrant. So, work with the collectors, establish that the debt is valid and negotiate a settlement. Or let it stay in default. Your credit report in the US is shot. It will be a long time before the default ages off your report. This is important if you try to open a bank account, rent an apartment, or get a job in the US.

You might be unreachable for a court summons, but AWG only requires that the collectors be able to confirm that you work for a company that is subject to US laws.

Why do I start here, because this author isnt telling you that the more people take his advice, the more their earnings will regress to the mean or below. In fact, most of my entrepreneur friends have to go back to work when their reality fails after they burn through their savings. 401ks are not a perfect system, but there are more 401k millionaires now than ever before this, and people who give the authors advice are always looking to avoid doing what they need to do  save for retirement. Most people I know sadly realize this in their 50s, when its too late, and start trying to \"catch up.\" I dont blame the author for this, as he knows his article will appeal to younger people who dont have the wisdom to see that his advice hasnt been great for most. The reality is that for most people 401ks will provide tax advantaged savings that you can use when youre older taxes will eat at your earnings, so these accounts really help. Finally, look at the article again especially the part you quote. He says inflation will carve out what you save, yet inflation is less than 2. Where is he getting this from? In the past decade, weve seen numerous deflationary spirals and the market overall has come back from the fall in 2009.

According to multiple sources online, including the thread referenced by MDTechs answer, OkPay either cannot or will not get a license, so they are out. I dug on this a bit more because I thought it was interesting, and OkPay has other issues with U.S. and other regulators related to its interaction with Bitcoins, which themselves are a hot potato for regulation right now and may explain the licensing problem. It seems to also be facing regulatory pressure in other countries, by the way, so its not strictly a problem they face in the U.S. Just for whatever reason, the problem is greater here. Some interesting summary points With mounting pressure on online money exchanges from US regulators, payments processor OKPay has announced that it is suspending processing for all Bitcoin exchanges, including industry leader Mt. Gox. ... Earlier this month, the US Department of Homeland Security seized Mt. Goxs account with mobile payment processor Dwolla, on allegations that the account was in violation of US Code 18 USC  1960 by operating an \"unlicensed money transmitting business.\" Just where the Bitcoin market falls under US law is unclear, because the legality of Bitcoin transactions has yet to be tried in court and law enforcement has refused to comment on ongoing investigations, such as the Dwolla case. httpwww.theregister.co.uk20130529okpaysuspendsbitcoinprocessing In March, the US Treasury said any firms dealing in the virtual currency would be considered \"money services businesses\" just like any other, which means they must hand over transaction information to the government and work to prevent money laundering. httpwww.theregister.co.uk20130515mtgoxuscourt In the UK, it apparently has also had trouble with banking partners quoting a OkPay official regarding changing bank providers The UK bank that we used before did not make a final decision on whether to handle transactions in favour of cryptocurrencies or not. Therefore the compliance department of the bank asked us to restrict such transfers. This apparently allowed them to reverse a policy in the UK OKPAYs policy shift comes just months after it stipulated that GBP users check a box, verifying that their funds would not be spent on cryptocurrency, a feature that further incited users. httpwww.coindesk.comokpaygbpbitcointransactions I hadnt heard of this company prior to your question, but having done some research, I tend to think that at least the part of this quote about language, attributed to a user, is true OKPAY are quite paranoid about AML and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at English, so their replies are often hard to understand. Their support are also slow [sic]. However in my experience they are an honest company. I found at least one case where rumors that the entire company were going to shut down were traced back to a poorly translated message issued by the company.

    "topic": "Why do people always talk about stocks that pay high dividends?",
    "content": "Someone who buys a stock is fundamentally buying a share of all future dividends, plus the future liquidation value of the company in the event that it is liquidated. While some investors may buy stocks in the hope that they will be able to find other people willing to pay more for the stock than they did, thats a zero sum game. The only way investors can make money in the aggregate is if either stocks pay dividends or if the money paid for company assets at liquidation exceeds total net price for which the company sold shares. One advantage of dividends from a marketrationality perspective is that dividend payments are easy to evaluate than company value. Ideally, the share price of a company should match the present pershare cash value of all future dividends and liquidation, but its generally impossible to know in advance what that value will be. Stock prices may sometimes rise because of factors which increase the expected pershare cash value of future dividends and liquidations. In a sane market, rising prices on an item will reduce peoples eagerness to buy and increase peoples eagerness to sell. Unfortunately, in a marketplace where steady price appreciation is expected the feedback mechanisms responsible for stability get reversed. Rapidly rising prices act as a red flag to buyersunfortunately, bulls dont see red flags as signal to stop, but rather as a signal to charge ahead. For a variety of reasons including the disparate treatment of dividends and capital gains, its often not practical for a company to try to stabilize stock prices through dividends and stock sales. Nonetheless, dividends are in a sense far more \"real\" than stock price appreciation, since paying dividends generally requires that companies actually have sources of revenues and profits. By contrast, its possible for stock prices to go through the roof for companies which have relatively few assets of value and no real expectation of becoming profitable businesses, simply because investors see rising stock prices as a \"buy\" signal independent of any real worth."

These expenses are payed from the asset gained and has no effect to the liability. When the company then makes a profit it is taxable. How ever this taxable profit may be deducted from from a tax reserve accumulated over the last loss periods up to ten years. When the company then pays the loan back it is divided in principal and interest. The principal payment is a deduction in the companys liabilities and has no tax effect. The interest payment the again does have effect in taxes in the way of decreasing them. On your personal side giving loan has no effect. Getting the principal back has no effect.

Submit the receipt for reimbursement and follow the employers procedure on its approval. When income tax agent looks at your data, he actually will ask about the 1500 tab. You and youll employer will have to do some explaining about the business activity that caused it. If the revenue agent is not satisfied, the 750 that is paid to you will be declared as your income.

    "content": "In this type of strategy profit is made when the shares go down as your main position is the short trade of the common stock. The convertible instruments will tend to move in about the same direction as the underlying what it can be converted to but less violently as they are traded less lower volatility and lower volume in the market on both sides, however, they are not being used to make a profit so much as to hedge against the stock going up. Since both the bonds and the preference shares are higher on the list to be repaid if the company declares bankruptcy and the bonds pay out a fixed amount of interest as well, both also help protect against problems that may occur with a long position in the common stock. Essentially the plan with this strategy is to earn fixed income on the bonds whilst the stock price drops and then to sell both the bonds and buy the stock back on the market to cover the short position. If the prediction that the stock will fall is wrong then you are still earning fixed income on the debt and are able to convert it into stock at the higher price to cover the short sale eliminating, or reducing, the loss made on the short sale. Effectively the profit here is made on the spread between the price of the bond, accounting for the conversion price, and the price of the stock and that fixed income is less volatile except usually in the junk market than stock."

That means either increasing your income or reducing your total expenses. Either take effort. Basically, you need a plan. If your plan is to increase income, work out how. If the plan is to increase hours in your current, you need to allow for your needs sleep, rest, etc and also convince your employer they will benefit by paying you to work more hours. If your intent is to increase your hourly rate, you need to convince a current or prospective employer that you have the capacity, skills, etc to deliver more on the job, so you are worth paying more. If your intent is to get qualifications so you can get a better paying job, work out how much effort studying, etc you will apply, over how long, what expenses you will carry fees, textbooks, etc, and how long you will carry them for will you accept working some years in a higher paying job, to clear the debt?. Most of those options involve a lot of work, take time, and often mean carrying debt until you are in a position to pay it off. There is nothing wrong with getting a job while studying, but you have to be realistic about the demands. There is nothing sacrosanct about studying that means you shouldnt have a job. However, you need to be clear how many hours you can work in a job before your studies will suffer unnecessarily, and possibly accept the need to study part time so you can work which means the study will take longer, but you wont struggle as much financially. If your plan is to reduce expenses, you need a budget. Itemize all of your spend. Dont hide anything from that list, no matter how small. Work out which of the things you need paying off debt is one, which you can get rid of, which you need to reduce  and by how much. Be brutal with reducing or eliminating the nonessentials no matter how much you would prefer otherwise. Keep going until you have a budget in which your expenses are less than your income. Then stick to it  there is no other answer. Revisit your budget regularly, so you can handle things you havent previously planned for say, rent increase, increase fees for something you need, etc. If your income increases or you have a windfall, dont simply drop the budget  the best way to get in trouble is to neglect the budget, and get into a pattern of spending more than you have. Instead, incorporate the changes into your budget  and plan how you will use the extra income. There is nothing wrong with increasing your spend on nonessentials, but the purpose of the budget is to keep control of how you do that, by keeping track of what you can afford."

    "topic": "Calculating pay off for credit card with multiple APRs",
    "content": "The first thing you need to do is look at your terms and conditions of your credit card, or ask your bank, how they will apply the payments. As Dilip notes in his answer, in the US, they will likely apply the minimum payment to the lower rate balance, and then must apply the rest above the minimum to the higher rate balance. In other countries, this will vary by law and custom. Do not assume it will pay off the higher balance, or proportionally, without asking. Lets take the following example. You owe 6000. 5000 is at 13.5 normal purchase rate and 1000 is at 22 cash advance rate. If your bank applies payments to both balances proportionally, then a payment of 600 will reduce your purchase balance by 500 and your cash advance balance by 100. The average APR, then, is simply sum of the product of the APR times balance. So here, .1355000  .22510006000  15. This is called a weighted average. If the bank applies the payment differently  such as to the lower rate first, or some specified part to the lower rate and the rest to the higher rate  then this will be misleading if you enter it into a calculator, because your average APR will rise over time as you pay off the purchase balance but dont pay off the cash advance balance, or may decrease if the opposite happens. The weighted average is probably reasonably close in the circumstance that you describe, even if you have rules applying the balance differently, so long as they dont 100 pay down the lower rate  so it may be the simplest option for you in terms of rough calculations where its not critical to be correct, just close. One approach using the online calculators that might be better, is to treat these like two separate loanscards. Many calculators exist for multiple balances. Then you can allocate funds differently to the two cards. This would allow you to see how long you will need until youve paid off the higher balance, for example, although it probably wont perfectly match things  unless you find a site that has this specific option available you probably will have to either live with a small error in your calculations or do the math by hand."

The time may come when you really need to spend a little more than you have, and a credit card will let you do that, at a very modest cost if you pay it off promptly no cost, if paid within 30 days. I learned this when I was traveling and stranded due to bad weather. I had almost nothing in my bank account at the time, and while I actually did have a small studenttype credit card, I came really close to having to sleep at the train station when I didnt have enough for another night in a hotel. As an example, if you have close friends or family living across the country, and something tragic were to happen, would you be able to pay for a flight to attend the funeral? What if youd recently had an accident and a big medical bill it doesnt take much, a broken arm can cost 10,000? Perhaps you have a solid nest egg, but breaking a CD ahead of schedule or taking shortterm capital gains on a mutual fund will usually cost more than one or two months of interest payments."

    "content": "Insurance isnt a product designed to protect against financial loss. The product is designed to allow people to pay a small fee the premium for peace of mind. This allows the insured to feel as if their purchase was worthy they see the potential of loss as a concern and the premiums small enough to allow them to not worry about having a loss. Insurance companies will then seek out insurable risks where the perceived losses far out weight the actual losses risk assessment. So, you answer is that your friends are paying for peace of mind."

    "topic": "Pay for a cheap car or take out a loan?",
    "content": "If you buy a new car, the odds that it will require repairs are fairly low, and if it does, they should be covered by the warranty. If you buy a used car, there is a fair chance that it will need some sort of repairs, and there probably is no warranty. But think about how much repairs are likely to cost. A new car these days costs like 25,000 or more. You can find reasonably decent used cars for a few thousand dollars. Say you bought a used car for 2,000. Is it likely that it will need 23,000 in repairs? No way. Even if you had to make thousands of dollars worth of repairs to the used car, it would almost certainly be cheaper than buying a new car. Ive bought three used vehicles in the last few years, one for me, one for my son, and one for my daughter. I paid, lets see, I think between 4,000 and 6,000 each. Weve had my sons car for about 9 months and to date had 40 in repairs. My daughters car turned out to have a bunch of problems I ended up putting maybe another 2,000 into it. But now shes got a car shes very happy with that cost me maybe 6,000 between purchase and repairs, still way less than a new car. My pickup had big time problems, including needing a new transmission and a new engine. Ive put, hmm, maybe 7,000 into it. Its definitely debatable if it was worth replacing the engine. But even at all that, if I had bought that truck new it would have cost over 30,000. Presumably if I bought new I would have had a nicer vehicle and I could have gotten exactly the options I wanted, so Im not entirely happy with how this one turned out, but I still saved money by buying used. Heres what I do when I buy a used car I go into it expecting that there will be repairs. Depending on the age and condition of the car, I plan on about 1000 within the first few months, probably another 1000 stretched out over the next year or so. I plan for this both financially and emotionally. By financially I mean that I have money set aside for repairs or have available credit or one way or another have planned for it in my budget. By emotionally I mean, I have told myself that I expect there to be problems, so I dont get all upset when there are and start screaming and crying about how I was ripped off. When you buy a used car, take it for granted that there will be problems, but youre still saving money over buying new. Sure, its painful when the repair bills hit. But if you buy a new car, youll have a monthly loan payment EVERY MONTH. Oh, and if you have a little mechanical aptitude and can do at least some of the maintenance yourself, the savings are bigger. Bear in mind that while you are saving money, you are paying for it in uncertainty and aggravation. With a new car, you can be reasonably confidant that it will indeed start and get you to work each day. With a used car, theres a much bigger chance that it wont start or will leave you stranded. 2,000 is definitely the low end, and you say that that would leave you no reserve for repairs. I dont know where you live or what used cars prices are like in your area. Where I live, in Michigan, you can get a pretty decent used car for about 5,000. If I were you Id at least look into whether I could get a loan for 4,000 or 5,000 to maybe get a better used car. Of course that all depends on how much money you will be making and what your other expenses are. When youre a little richer and better established, then if a shiny new car is important to you, you can do that. Me, Im 56 years old, Ive bought new cars and Ive bought used cars and Ive concluded that having a fancy new car just isnt something that I care about, so these days I buy used."

    "topic": "What does net selling or buying of a stock mean?",
    "content": "Im not sure the term actually has a clear meaning. We can think of \"what does this mean\" in two ways its broad semanticmetaphorical meaning, and its mechanical \"what actual variables in the market represent this quantity\". Net buyingselling have a clear meaning in the former sense by analogy to the basic concept of supply and demand in equilibrium markets. Its not as clear what their meaning should be in the latter sense. Roughly, as the top comment notes, you could say that a price decrease is because of net selling at the previous price level, while a price rise is driven by net buying at the previous price level. But in terms of actual market mechanics, the only way prices move is by matching of a buyer and a seller, so every market transaction inherently represents an instantaneous balance across the bidask spread. So then we could think about the notion of orders. Actual transactions only occur in balance, but there is a whole book of standing orders at various prices. So maybe we could use some measure of the volume at various price levels in each of the bidask books to decide some notion of net buyingselling. But again, actual transactions occur only when matched across the spread. If a significant order volume is added on one side or the other, but at a price far away from the bidoffer  far enough that an actual trade at that price is unlikely to occur  should that be included in the notion of net buyingselling? Presumably there is some price distance from the bidoffer where the orders dont matter for net buyingselling. Im sure youd find a lot of buyers for BRK.A at 1, but thats completely irrelevant to the notion of net buyingselling in BRK.A. Maybe the closest thing I can think of in terms of actual market mechanics is the comparative total volumes during the period that would still have been executed if forced to execute at the end of period price. Assuming that traders valuations are fixed through the period in question, and trading occurs on the basis of fundamentals which I know isnt a good assumption in practice, but the impact of price history upon future price is too complex for this analysis, we have two cases. If price falls, we can assume all buyers who executed above the last price in the period would have happily bought at the last price saving money, while all sellers who executed below the last price in the period would also be happy to sell for more. The former will be larger than the latter. If the price rises, the reverse is true."

    "content": "An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest, as Ben Franklin said. However, this is not a question I can answer for you, as it depends on the opportunities that are specifically available to you as an individual. Sometimes opportunities will knock on your door and you can take advantage, other times you have to create that door to allow opportunities to knock. Maybe you have a friend that is opening a side business, maybe there is a class you can get into at a trivial cost. What I suggest is to start investing just to get into the habit of it, not so much for the returns. Before you do, however, any financial advisor will advise you to begin with a emergency fund, worth about 36 months of your expenses for that time. I wanted to hit the ground running and start investing in stocks, but first things first I guess. \"Millionaire Next Door\" will help you get into a saving mindset, \"I will teach you to be rich\" is ok, plenty of other books. My advice is keep doing what youre doing, learn to start saving, and once you have obtained an emergency fund of the amount of your choosing, start looking to invest in Index Funds or ETFs through any platform that has LOW FEES!! I use Betterment, but Vanguard is good too, as they allow you to get your feet wet and its passive. Hope this helps."

Tell the bank, in writing that you were not expecting to receive this money and are a bit surprised to receive it. Preferably in a way that creates a paper trail. And then stop talking. Why? Because you honestly dont know. This puts you at arms length to the money disavowing it, but not refusing it. Wildest dreams nobody wants it back ever. As for the person bugging you for the cash, tell them nothing except work with their own bank. Then ignore them completely. He probably hacked someone else, diverted their money into your account, and hes conning you into transferring it to a third location him. Leaving you holding the bag when the reversals hit months later. He doesnt want you reversing that would return the money to the rightful owner! He works this scam on dozens of people, and he wins if some cooperate. Now heres the hard part. Wait. This is not drama or gossip, you do not need to keep people updated. You are not a bank fraud officer who deals with the latest scams everyday, you dont know what the heck you are doing in this area of practice. In fact, playing amateur sleuth will make you suspicious. There is nothing for you to do. That urge to \"do something\" is how scammers work on you. And these things take time. Not everyone banks in real time on smartphone apps. Of course scammers target those whod be slow to notice this game is all about velocity. Eventually months, one of two things is likely to happen. The transfer is found to be fraudulent and the bank reverses it, and they slap you with penalties andor the cops come knockin. You refer them to the letter you sent, explaining your surprise at receiving it. That letter is your \"get out of jail free\" card. The other person works with their bank and claws back the money. One day it just disappears. not that this is your problem, but theyd file a dispute with their bank, their bank talks to your bank, your bank finds your letter, oh, ok. If a year goes by and neither of these things happens, youre probably in the clear. Dont get greedy and try to manipulate circumstances so you are more likely to keep the money.

    "content": "Not to detract from the other answers at all which are each excellent and useful in their own right, but heres my interpretation of the ideas Equity is the answer to the question \"Where is the value of the company coming from?\" This might include owner stakes, shareholder stock investments, or outside investments. In the current moment, it can also be defined as \"Equity  X  Current Income  Current Expenses\" Ill come back to X. This fits into the standard accounting model of \"Assets  Liabilities  Value Equity\", where Assets includes not only bank accounts, but also warehouse inventory, raw materials, etc. Liabilities are debts, loans, shortfalls in inventory, etc. Both are abstract categories, whereas Income and Expense are hard dollar amounts. At the end of the year when the books balance, they should all equal out. Equity up until this point has been an abstract concept, and its not an account in the traditional gnucash sense. However, its common practice for businesses to close the books once a year, and to consolidate outstanding balances. When this happens, Equity ceases to be abstract and becomes a hard value \"How much is the company worth at this moment?\", which has a definite, numeric value. When the books are opened fresh for a new business year, the Current Income and Current Expense amounts are zeroed out. In this situation, in order for the big equation to equal out Assets  Liabilities  X  Income  Expeneses the previous net value of the company must be accounted for. This is where X comes in, the starting previous years equity. This allows the Assets and Liabilities to be nonzero, while the current Income and Expenses are both still zeroed out. The account which represents X in gnucash is called \"Equity\", and encompasses not only initial investments, but also the net increase  decreases from previous years. While the name would more accurately be called \"Starting Equity\", the only problem caused by the naming convention is the confusion of the concept Equity X  Income  Expenses with the account X, named \"Equity\"."

    "content": "The Fed doesnt exactly have a specific schedule when they decide to create a new dollar. Instead, they engage in open market operations, creating and destroying money as is necessary to preserve a certain interest rate for lending and borrowing. Its an ongoing process. When the Fed meets periodically and they see that inflation is getting out of hand, they will raise that rate when they see that the economy is weak, they will lower it. They change the target rate from time to time, but they seldom tell people exactly what theyll do in advance, aside from them recently saying that rates will remain incredibly low \"for an extended period of time\". There are people who trade futures contracts based on what they think these rates will be, and the Fed does publish information on what the market thinks the probabilities are. Thats probably the closest thing to telling you \"how much and when\". If you want to know about the size of the money supply, ask the Federal Reserve you probably want series H.6, Money Stock Measures. For an explanation of what the data series there means, ask Wikipedia youre probably interested in M2, because thats what actually affects the economy, though M0 is closer to what they actually \"print\" currency, bills and coins, and deposits at the central bank. If youre concerned about the actual real value of your dollar dropping, the actual value drop is better understood by looking at either the inflation rate, or an exchange rate against a foreign currency and depending on what you were hoping to use that dollar for, there are a couple of different inflation rates. The standard inflation rate which measures what happens in your day to day life is the consumer price index, published by the BLS.

    "topic": "At what point do index funds become unreliable?",
    "content": "The argument you are making here is similar to the problem I have with the stronger forms of the efficient market hypothesis. That is if the market already has incorporated all of the information about the correct prices, then theres no reason to question any prices and then the prices never change. However, the mechanism through which the market incorporates this information is via the actors buying an selling based on what they see as the market being incorrect. The most basic concept of this problem I think starts with the idea that every investor is passive and they simply buy the market as one basket. So every paycheck, the index fund buys some more stock in the market in a completely static way. This means the demand for each stock is the same. No one is paying attention to the actual companies performance so a poor performers stock price never moves. The same for the high performer. The only thing moving prices is demand but thats always up at a more or less constant rate. This is a topic that has a lot of discussion lately in financial circles. Here are two articles about this topic but Im not convinced the author is completely serious hence the \"worstcase scenario\" title. These are interesting reads but again, take this with a grain of salt. You should follow the links in the articles because they give a more nuanced understanding of each potential issue. One thing thats important is that the reality is nothing like what I outline above. One of the links in these articles that is interesting is the one that talks about how we now have more indexes than stocks on the US markets. The writer points to this as a problem in the first article, but think for a moment why that is. There are many different types of strategies that active managers follow in how they determine what goes in a fund based on different stock metrics. If a stocks PE ratio drops below a critical level, for example, a number of indexes are going to sell it. Some might buy it. Its up to the investors you and me to pick which of these strategies we believe in. Another thing to consider is that active managers are losing their clients to the passive funds. They have a vested interest in attacking passive management."

You, as a person, are a legal entity, and so you can have them pay you directly, by name. This is in effect a \"sole proprietorship\" arrangement and it is the situation of most independent contractors youre working for yourself, and you get all the money, but you also have all the responsibility. You can also set up a legal alias, or a \"Doing Business As\" DBA name. The only thing that changes versus using your own name is... well... that you arent using your own name, to be honest. You pay some trivial fee for the paperwork to the county clerk or other office of record, and youre now not only John Doe, youre \"Zolani Enterprises\", and your business checks can be written out to that name and the bank who will want a copy of the DBA paperwork to file when you set the name up as a payable entity on the account will cash them for you. An LLC, since it was mentioned, is a \"Limited Liability Company\". It is a legal entity, incorporeal, that is your \"avatar\" in the business world. It, not you, is the entity that primarily faces anyone else in that world. You become, for legal purposes, an agent of that company, authorized to make decisions on its behalf. You can do all the same things, make all the same money, but if things go pearshaped, the company is the one liable, not you. Sounds great, right? Well, theres a downside, and thats taxes and the increased complexity thereof. Depending on the exact structure of the company, the IRS will treat the LLC either as a corporation, a partnership, or as a \"disregarded entity\". Most oneman LLCs are typically \"disregarded\", meaning that for tax purposes, all the money the company makes is treated as if it were made by you as a sole proprietor, as in the above cases and with the associated increased FICA and lack of tax deductions that an \"employee\" would get. Nothing can be \"retained\" by the company, because as far as the IRS is concerned it doesnt exist, so whether the money from the profits of the company actually made it into your personal checking account or not, it has to be reported by you on the Schedule C. You can elect, if you wish, to have the LLC treated as a corporation this allows the corporation to retain earnings and thus to \"own\" liquid assets like cash, as opposed to only fixed assets like land, cars etc. It also allows you to be an \"employee\" of your own company, and pay yourself a true \"salary\", with all the applicable tax rules including pretax healthcare, employerpaid FICA, etc. However, the downside here is that some money is subject to double taxation any monies \"retained\" by the company, or paid out to members as \"dividends\", is \"profit\" of the company for which the company is taxed at the corporate rate. Then, the money from that dividend you receive from the company is taxed again at the capital gains rate on your own 1040 return. This also means that you have to file taxes twice once for the corporation, once for you as the individual. You cant, of course, have it both ways with an LLC you cant pay yourself a true \"salary\" and get the associated tax breaks, then receive leftover profits as a \"distribution\" and avoid double taxation. It takes multiple \"members\" owners to have the LLC treated like a partnership, and there are specific types of LLCs set up to handle investments, where some of what Ive said above doesnt apply. I wont get into that because the question inferred a singleowner situation, but the tax rules in these additional situations are again different."

    "content": "I had an HSA for two or three years. I found very routinely that my insurance company had negotiated rates with innetwork providers. So as I never hit the deductible, I always had to pay 100 of the negotiated rate, but it was still much less than the providers general rate. Sometimes dramatically so. Like I had some blood and urine tests done and the general rate was 450 but the negotiated rate was only 40. I had laser eye surgery and the general rate was something like 1500 but the negotiated rate was more like 500. Et cetera. Other times it was the same or trivially different, like routine office visits it made no difference. I found that I could call the insurance company and ask for the negotiated rate and they would tell me. When I asked the doctor or the hospital, they either couldnt tell me or they wouldnt. Its possible that the doctors office doesnt really know what rates theyve agreed to, they might have just signed some contract with the insurance company that says, yes, well accept whatever you give us. But either way, I had to go to the insurance company to find out. Youd think theyd just publish the list on a web site or something. After all, its to the insurance companys advantage if you go to the cheapest provider. With a \"regular\" nonHSA plan, theyre share of the total is less. Even with an HSA plan if you go to a cheaper provider you are less likely to hit the deductible. Yes, medical care in the U.S. is rather bizarre in that providers routinely expect you to commit to paying for their services before they will tell you the price. Can you imagine any other industry working this way? Can you imagine buying a car and the dealer saying, \"I have no idea what this car costs. If you like it, great, take it and drive it home, and in a few weeks well send you a bill. And of course whatever amount we put on that bill you are legally obligated to pay, but we refuse to tell you what that amount will be.\" The American Medical Association used to have a policy that they considered it \"unethical\" for doctors to tell patients the price of treatment in advance.

    "topic": "Why is there inconsistent returns difference between direct and regular Mutual Funds?",
    "content": "This answer refers to the US investment landscape Im not sure your classification of funds as direct and regular accurately reflects the nature of the mutual fund industry. Its not the funds themselves that are \"direct\" or \"regular.\" Rather its the way an investor chooses to invest in them. If you make the investment yourself through your brokerage account, you may say its a direct investment. If you pay a financial advisor to do this for you, its \"regular.\" For a given fund, you could make the investment yourself or you could use an advisor. Note that many funds have various share classes. Share classes may be accessed in different ways. The institutional class may be accessible through your 401k or perhaps not even there, for example. The premium class may require a certain minimum investment. Some classes will have a frontendload or backendload. Each of these will have a different expense ratio and fees even though the money ends up in the same portfolio. These expenses are, by law, publicly available in the prospectus and in numerous other places. Share classes with higher fees will earn less each year after fees, just as you suggest. Your intuition is correct on this point. Now, there is one fee to be aware of that funds either have or do not have. Thats a 12b1 fee. This fee is a kickback to financial advisors who funnel your money into their fund. If you use a financial advisor, he or she will likely put your money into these funds because they have a financial incentive to do so. That way they get paid twice once by you and once by the mutual fund. It has been robustly shown in the finance academic literature that funds without this fee dominate are better in some ways and in no ways worse than funds with this fee. I suppose you could say that funds and share classes with a 12b1 fee were designed for \"regular\" investment and those without were designed for \"direct\" but that doesnt mean you cant invest in a 12b1 fee fund directly nor that you cant twist your advisors arm into getting you into a good fund without a 12b1. Unfortunately, if you have this level of knowledge, then you probably dont need a financial advisor."

    "content": "For Canada No distinction is made in the regulation between naked or covered short sales. However, the practice of naked short selling, while not specifically enumerated or proscribed as such, may violate other provisions of securities legislation or selfregulatory organization rules where the transaction fails to settle. Specifically, section 126.1 of the Securities Act prohibits activities that result or contribute to a misleading appearance of trading activity in, or an artificial price for, a security or derivative of a security or that perpetrate a fraud on any person or company. Part 3 of National Instrument 23101 Trading Rules contains similar prohibitions against manipulation and fraud, although a person or company that complies with similar requirements established by a recognized exchange, quotation and trade reporting system or regulation services provider is exempt from their application. Under section 1271 of the Securities Act, the OSC also has a public interest jurisdiction to make a wide range of orders that, in its opinion, are in the public interest in light of the purposes of the Securities Act notwithstanding that the subject activity is not specifically proscribed by legislation. The TSX Rule Book also imposes certain obligations on its participating organizations in connection with trades that fail to settle see, for example, Rule 5301 BuyIns. In other words, shares must be located by the broker before they can be sold short. A share may not be locatable because there are none available in the brokers inventory, that it cannot lend more than what it has on the books for trade. A share may not be available because the interest rate that brokers are charging to borrow the share is considered too high by that broker, usually if it doesnt pass on borrowing costs to the customer. There could be other reasons as well. If one broker doesnt have inventory, another might. I recommend checking in on IBs list. If they cant get it, my guess would be that no one can since IB passes on the cost to finance short sales."

That variation might go for you or against you. Depending on your situation, you might prefer to take a determined rate to the variations. In addition, some bond types provide tax benefits e.g. treasuries and municipal bonds that change the effective return  You cannot just compare the interest rates. Finally, the bonds have \"resale\" value on the secondary market like stock  Depending on your outlook and strategy, you might by the bond for its value as a security rather than for the interest specifically just like youd could buy a dividendpaying stock for its value as a security rather than for the dividend. In other words, you might think that bond values are going up, so you buy bonds with the intent of making a capital gain rather than counting on the interest returned. The bond market does depend on the interest rate, so these are not independent factors. I see the other answer that mentions the potential for your bank busting and you losing money beyond the FDIC insurance limit. The question doesnt specify U.S. Government bonds though, so I dont think that answer is generally good. It would be good in the case that you had a lot of money especially an institution or foreign government and you were specifically interested in U.S. Treasury bonds. Not so much if you invest in corporate bonds where you have no government insurance  assurance of any sort.

    "topic": "How effective are hotel condos for investment properties?",
    "content": "I agree with Joe Taxpayer that a lot of details are missing to really evaluate it as an investment... for context, I own a few investment properties including a small 10 unit apartment complex. My answer might be more than you really wantneed, it kind of turned into Real Estate Investing 101, but to be fair youre really asking 3 different questions here your headline asks \"how effective are CondoHotel developments as investments?\" An answer to that is... sometimes, very. These are a way for youthe investorto get higher rents per sq. ft. as an owner, and for the hotel to limit its risks and access additional development funding. By your description, it sounds like this particular company is taking a substantial cut of rents. I dont know this property segment specifically, but I can give you my insight for longerterm apartment rentals... the numbers are the same at heart. The other two questions youre implying are \"How effective is THIS condohotel development?\" and \"Should you buy into it?\" If you have the funds and the financial wherewithal to honestly consider this, then I am sure that you dont need your hand held for the investment proscons warnings of the last question. But let me give you some of my insight as far as the way to evaluate an investment property, and a few other questions you might ask yourself before you make the decision to buy or perhaps to invest somewhere else. The finance side of real estate can be simple, or complicated. It sounds like you have a good start evaluating it, but heres what I would do Start with figuring out how much revenue you will actually see Gross Potential Income 365 days x Average Rent for the Room  GPI minus Vacancy... youll have to figure this out... youll actually do the math as Vacancy Rate  x GPI equals Effective Potential Income  EPI Then find out how much you will actually pocket at the end of the day as operating income Take EPI minus Operating expenses ... Utilities ... Maintenace ... HOA ... Marketing if you do this yourself minus Management Expenses ... 40 of EPI ... any other fees they may charge if you manage it yourself. ... Extra tax help? minus Debt Service ... Mortgage payment ... include Insurances property, PMI, etc  Net Operating Income NOI Now NOI minus Taxes  Net Income Net Income add back Depreciation add back sometimes Mortgage Interest  Aftertax Cash Flows There are two \"quickie\" numbers real estate investors can spout off. One is the NOI, the other is the Cap Rate. In order to answer \"How effective is THIS development?\" youll have to run the numbers yourself and decide. The NOI will be based on any assumptions you choose to make for vacancy rates, actual revenue from hotel room bookings, etc. But it will show you how much you should bring in before taxes each year. If you divide the NOI by the asking price of your unit and then multiply by 100, youll get the \"Cap Rate\". This is a rough estimate of the rate of return you can expect for your unit... if you buy in. If you come back and say \"well I found out it has a XX cap rate\", we wont really be qualified to help you out. Well established mega investment properties think shopping centers, office buildings, etc. can be as low as 35 cap rates, and as high as 1012. The more risky the property, the higher your return should be. But if its something you like, and the chance to make a 6 return feels right, then thats your choice. Or if you have something like a 15 cap rate... thats not necessarily outstanding given the level of risk uncertain vacancies involved in a hotel. Some other questions you should ask yourself include How much competition is there in the area for shortterm lodging? This could drive vacancies up or down... and rents up or down as well How liquid will the property room be as an asset? If you can just break even on operating expense, then it might still make sense as an investment if you think that it might appreciate in value AND you would be able to sell the unit to someone else. How much experience does this property management company have... a in general, b running hotels, and c running these kinds of condohotel combination projects? I would be especially interested in what exactly youre getting in return for paying them 40 of every booking. Seasonality? This will play into Joe Taxpayers question about Vacancy Rates. Your profile says youre from TX... which hints that you probably arent looking at a condo on ski slopes or anything, but if youre looking at something thats a spring breakesque destination, then you might still have a great run of high o during MarchAprilMayJune, but be nearly empty during OctoberNovemberDecember. I hope that helps. There is plenty of room to make a more \"exact\" model of what your cash flows might look like, but that will be based on assumptions and research youre probably not making at this time."

If you max out tax advantaged retirement accounts that would reduce the upfront taxes you are paying on your savings. Is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor? The best time to see a financial advisor is any time that your situation changes. New job? Getting married? Having a child? Got a big promotion or raise? Suddenly thinking about buying a house? Is it worth the money? How would shehe help me? If you pick an advisor who has incentive to help you rather than just pad hisher own pockets with commissions, then the advice is usually worth the money. If there is someone whose time is already paid for, that may be better. For example, if you get an accountant to help you with your taxes and ask himher how to best reduce your taxes the next year, the advice is already paidfor in the fee you for the tax help. An advisor should help you minimize the high taxes you are almost certainly paying as a single earner, and minimize the stealth taxes you are paying in inflation on that 100k sitting in the bank."

    "topic": "How to start personal finances?",
    "content": "Personal finances are not intuitive for everyone, and it can be a challenge to know what to do when you havent been taught. Congratulations on recognizing that you need to make a change. The first step that I would recommend is what youve already done Assemble your bank statements so you can get an accurate picture of what money you currently have. Keep organized folders so you can find your bank statements when you need them. In addition to the bank statements for your checking and savings accounts, you also need to assess any debt that you have. Have you taken out any loans that need to be paid back? Do you have any credit card debt? Make a list of all your debts, and make sure that you have folders for these statements as well. Hopefully, you dont have any debts. But if you are like most people, you owe money to someone, and you may even owe more money than you currently have in your bank accounts. If you have debts, fixing this problem will be one of your goals. No matter what your debt is, you need to make sure that from now on, you dont spend more money than you take in as income. To do this, you need to make a budget. A budget is a plan for spending your money. To get started with a budget, make a list of all the income you will receive this month. Add it up, and write that amount at the top of a page. Next, you want to make a list of all the expenses you will have this month. Some of these expenses are more or less fixed rent, utility bills, etc. Write those down first. Some of the expenses you have more control over, such as food and entertainment. Give yourself some money to spend on each of these. You may also have some larger expenses that will happen in the future, such as a tuition or insurance payment. Allocate some money to those, so that by the time that payment comes around, you will have saved enough to pay for those expenses. If you find that you dont have enough income to cover all of your expenses in a month, you need to either reduce your expenses somewhere or increase your income until your budget is at a point where you have money left over at the end of each month. After youve gotten to this point, the next step is figuring out what to do with that extra money left over. This is where your goals come into play. If you have debt, I recommend that one of your first goals is to eliminate that debt as fast as possible. If you have no money saved, you should make one of your goals saving some money as an emergency fund. See the question Oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing for some ideas on what order you should place your goals. Doing the budget and tracking all of your spending on paper is possible, but many people find that using the right software to help you do this is much easier. I have written before on choosing budgeting software. All of the budgeting software packages I mentioned in that post are from the U.S., but many of them can successfully be used in Europe. YNAB, the program I use, even has an unofficial German users community that you might find useful. One of the things that budgeting software will help you with is the process of reconciling your bank statements. This is where you go through the bank statement each month and compare it to your own record of spending transactions in your budget. If there are any transactions that appear in the statement that you dont have recorded, you need to figure out why. Either it is an expense that you forgot to record, or it is a charge that you did not make. Record it if it is legitimate, or dispute the expense if it is fraudulent. For more information, look around at some of the questions tagged budget. I also recommend the book The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, which will provide more help in making a budget and getting out of debt."

    "topic": "Is a property that comes with tenants a risk?",
    "content": "The perceived risk depends on the entire situation, but often it is considered more risk, especially if you want to occupy yourself. Things you need to consider It can be very difficult to show a property with tenants occupying it. There are many reasons for this and most homes show  sell better empty. I have found many tenants make it difficult on the seller. Leaving their areas a mess, being unaccommodating and especially in markets that are flooded with options, a lot of buyers just wont bother with the difficulty of scheduling a showing in occupied properties. Ive tried to purchase many properties where the renter insists on being there during a showing, but wont open the door and theres no recourse for the landlord because his lease or laws in the area dont allow you to enter without permission. Also, it can be difficult to look past a lot of clutter and other peoples decorating and aroma \"preferences\" to be kind.  Is the property currently under lease and what is the period of that lease? It could be that the lease is month to month, or it could be years remaining on the lease period. It is likely a legal requirement in most areas that you honor the existing lease. I would never buy a property that has multiple years remaining. While some amateur landlords will allow 2 or even 5 year leases, this is a very bad idea for many reasons! What are laws like in your area for evicting tenants? You should know this regardless of whether or not you intend to occupy or keep it a rental. It can be a very difficult process evicting tenants and this process is vastly different from country to country and state to state here in the USA. Look into the security deposit  assuming there is one. How much is the deposit? Will it cover damage that may not exist yet? Dont think that just because you plan on evicting them soon, it isnt important. People can trash a place on the way out and an expensive lawsuit could be your only recourse. It is far easier to take a deposit than sue. I would absolutely demand that the deposit transfer to you upon sale. View the current renters with a fresh eye. Especially if you are considering leave it a rental, look into all of the typical requirements Their monthly income, their credit history, their criminal record, their payment history, their references. Are they likely to be good or terrible renters? If youre interested in the property, consider an offer which requires the current landlord to evict within the timeframe of the buysell agreement. This isnt an uncommon requirement. I think the first thing to do is go look at the property and see if you can determine for yourself why it hasnt sold yet. Properties all have different reasons for not selling in a reasonable time to the local market. Having renters alone in most markets shouldnt be that big of a factor. I would suspect bad smells, nasty renters, or an unfavorable lease agreement exists."

Likewise, it may seem everyones driving a nicer car, but Im going to predict thats based on area and a few other factors for instance, my used car feels like riches in a college town. The behavior of why people would pay money, especially with high interest debt, for something is a little different. To explain the behavior behind people who purchase luxury cars for some people, a car is a purchase that they value, similar to a person valuing the clothes they wear, the house they live in, or the equipment they buy and either borrowing or paying full price on an expensive car is worth it to them. We can call it a status symbol dismissively and criticize the financial waste without realizing, \"Wait, this is something they value\" like a rare book collector likes rare books would a rare book collector pass on borrowing money if it meant a onceinalifetime rare book purchase opportunity?. Have you ever felt, \"Wow this is coolawesomeamazing\" with something? Basically, thats how many of them feel toward these cars. As much as Id love to say theyre only doing it for status because Im not a car person, thats actually somewhat dehumanizing and the more Ive met people like this, the more Ive realized this is their \"thing\" and to them its totally worth it even with all the debt. I have no doubt that theres a percentage of them who truly may be misled  maybe they dont realize the full cost of borrowing money or leasing. Still, for those who dont care the full cost, thats because its their thing.

    "topic": "Whens the best time to sell the stock of a company that is being acquiredsold?",
    "content": "Im not sure what you expect in terms of answers, but it depends on personal factors. It pretty well has to depend on personal factors, since otherwise everyone would want to do the same thing either everyone thinks the current price is one to sell at, or everyone thinks its one to buy at, and there would be no trades. You wouldnt be able to do what you want, except on the liquidity provided by market makers. Once thats hit, the price is shifting quickly, so your calculation will change quickly too. Purely in terms of maximising expected value taking into account the time value of money, its all about the same. The market \"should\" already know everything you know, which means that one time to sell is as good as any other. The current price is generally below the expected acquisition price because theres a chance the deal will fall through and the stock price will plummet. Thats not to say there arent clever \"surefire\" trading strategies around acquisitions, but theyre certain to be based on more than just timing when to sell an existing holding of stock. If you have information that the market doesnt and assuming it is legal to do so then you trade based on that information. If you know something the market doesnt thats going to be good for price, hold. If you know something that will reduce the price, sell now. And \"know\" can be used in a loose sense, if you have a strong opinion against the market then you might like to invest based on that. Nothing beats being paid for being right. Finally, bear in mind that expected return is not the same as utility. You have your own investment goals and your own view of risk. If youre more riskaverse than the market then you might prefer to sell now rather than wait for the acquisition. If youre more riskprone than the market then you might prefer a 90 chance of 1 to 90c. Thats fine, hold the stock. The extreme case of this is that you might have a fixed sum at which you will definitely sell up, put everything into the most secure investments you can find, and retire to the Caribbean. If thats the case then you become totally riskaverse the instant your holding crosses that line. Sell and order cocktails."

If you could successfully market time successfully, then that would make a difference even at smaller time scales. But you probably cant, so there is no point in worrying about that either. As BrenBarn points out, your statement about not regaining their net worth until 2013 applies to someone who invested a lump sum at the 2007 peak, not to someone who invested continuously throughout. By my calculation, if you started continuously investing in a broad market index at the peak around Jun 4, 2007, you would have recovered your net worth relative to investing in a safe instrument that merely kept up with inflation, a hard thing to find these days around April 12, 2010. Ive done the computation on each business day because that is easier, so it might be slightly worse if do the periodic investment on each payday which is much more realist for a 401k.

    "topic": "What is the cause of sudden price spikes in the FOREX market?",
    "content": "If you do not understand the volatility of the fx market, you need to stop trading it, immediately. There are many reasons that fx is riskier than other types of investing, and you bear those risks whether you understand them or not. Below are a number of reasons why fx trading has high levels of risk 1 FX trades on the relative exchange rate between currencies. That means it is a zerosum game. Over time, the global fx market cannot grow. If the US economy doubles in size, and the European economy doubles in size, then the exchange rate between the USD and the EUR will be the same as it is today in an extreme example, all else being equal, yes I know that value of currency  value of total economy, but the general point stands. Compare that with the stock market  if the US economy doubles in size, then effectively the value of your stock investments will double in size. That means that stocks, bonds, etc. tied to real world economies generally increase when the global economy increases  it is a positive sum game, where many players can be winners. On the long term, on average, most people earn value, without needing to get into timing of trades. This allows many people to consider longterm equity investing to be lower risk than daytrading. With FX, because the value of a currency is in its relative position compared with another currency, 1 player is a winner, 1 player is a loser. By this token, most fx trading is necessarily shortterm daytrading, which by itself carries inherent risk. 2 Fx markets are insanely efficient I will lightly state that this is my opinion, but one that I am not alone in holding firmly. This means that public information about a currency [ie economic news, political news, etc.] is nearly immediately acted upon by many, many people, so that the revised fx price of that currency will quickly adjust. The more efficient a market is, the harder it is to time a trade. As an example, if you see on a news feed that the head of a central bank authority made an announcement about interest rates in that country [a common driver of fx prices], you have only moments to make a trade before the large institutional investors already factor it into their bidask prices. Keep in mind that the large fx players are dealing with millions and billions of dollars markets can move very quickly because of this. Note that some currencies trade more frequently than others. The main currency pairs are typically between USD and  or other G10 countrycurrencies [JPY, EUR, etc.]. As you get into currencies of smaller countries, trading of those currencies happens less frequently. This means that there may be some additional time before public information is priced in to the market value of that currency, making that currency less efficient. On the flip side, if something is infrequently traded, pricing can be more volatile, as a few relatively smaller trades can have a big impact on the market. 3 Uncertainty of political news. If you make an fx trade based on what you believe will happen after an expected political event, you are taking risk that the event actually happens. Politics and world events can be very hard to predict, and there is a high element of chance involved [see recent expected election results across the world for evidence of this]. For something like the stock market, a particular industry may get hit every once in a while with unexpected news, but the fx market is inherently tied to politics in a way that may impact exchange rates multiple times a day. 4 Leveraging. It is very common for fx traders to borrow money to invest in fx. This creates additional risk because it amplifies the impact of your positive or negative returns. This applies to other investments as well, but I mention it because high degrees of debt leveraging is extremely common in FX. To answer your direct question There are no single individual traders who spike fx prices  that is the impact you see of a very efficient market, with large value traders, reacting to frequent, surprising news. I reiterate If you do not understand the risks associated with fx trade, I recommend that you stop this activity immediately, at least until you understand it better [and I would recommend personally that any amateur investor never get involved in fx at all, regardless of how informed you believe you are]."

    "topic": "Renting or Buying an House",
    "content": "Some pros and cons to renting vs buying Some advantages of buying When you rent, the money you pay is gone. When you buy, assuming you dont have the cash to buy outright but get a mortgage, some of the payment goes to interest, but you are building equity. Ultimately you pay off the mortgage and you can then live rentfree. When you buy, you can alter your home to your liking. You can paint in the colors you like, put in the carpet or flooring you like, heck, tear down walls and alter the floor plan subject to building codes and safety consideration, of course. If you rent, you are usually sharply limited in what alterations you can make. In the U.S., mortgage interest is tax deductible. Rent is not. Property taxes are deductible from your federal income tax. So if you have, say, 1000 mortgage vs 1000 rent, the mortgage is actually cheaper. Advantages of renting There are a lot of transaction costs involved in buying a house. You have to pay a realtors commission, various legal fees, usually \"loan origination fees\" to the bank, etc. Plus the way mortgages are designed, your total payment is the same throughout the life of the loan. But for the first payment you owe interest on the total balance of the loan, while the last payment you only owe interest on a small amount. So early payments are mostly interest. This leads to the conventional advice that you should not buy unless you plan to live in the house for some reasonably long period of time, exact amount varying with whose giving the advice, but I think 3 to 5 years is common. One mitigating factor Bear in mind that if you buy a house, and then after 2 years sell it, and you discover that the sale price minus purchase price minus closing costs ends up a net minus, say, 20,000, its not entirely fair to say \"zounds! I lost 20,000 by buying\". If you had not bought this house, presumably you would have been renting. So the fair comparison is, mortgage payments plus losses on the resale compared to likely rental payments for the same period."

My claim is that if one starts at 21, and deposits 10 of their income each year, they will likely hit a good retirement nest egg. At an 8 return each year Keep in mind, the last 40 years produced 10, even with the lost decade the 10 saver has just over 15X their final income as a retirement account. At 4 withdrawal, this replaces 60 of their income, with social security the rest, to get to nearly 100 or so replacement. Note  I wrote an article about Social Security Benefits, showing the benefit as a percent of final income. At 50K its 42, its a higher replacement rate for lower income, but the replacement rate drops as income rises. So, the 5000 question. For an individual earning 50K or less, this amount is enough to fund their retirement. For those earning more, it will be one of the components, but not the full savings needed. By the way, a single person has a standard deduction and exemption totaling 10150 in 2014. I refer to this as the zero bracket. The next 8800 is taxed at 10. Why go 100 Roth and miss the opportunity to fund these low or no tax withdrawals?"

    "content": "tldr The CNN Money and Yahoo Finance charts are wildly inaccurate. The TD Ameritrade chart appears to be accurate and shows returns with reinvested dividends. Ignoring buggy data, CNN most likely shows reinvested dividends for quoted securities but not for the SP 500 index. Yahoo most likely shows all returns without reinvested dividends. Thanks to a tip from Grade Eh Bacon, I was able to determine that TD Ameritrade reports returns with reinvested dividends as it claims to do. Eyeballing the chart, it appears that SP 500 grew by 90 over the five year period the chart covers. Meanwhile, according to this SP 500 return estimator, the five year return of SP 500, with reinvested dividends, was 97.1 between July 2012 to July 2017 vs. 78.4 raw returns. I have no idea what numbers CNN Money is working from, because it claims SP 500 only grew about 35 over the last five years, which is less than half of the raw return. Ditto for Yahoo, which claims 45 growth. Even stranger still, the CNN chart for VFINX an SP 500 index fund clearly shows the correct market growth without reinvesting dividends from the SP 500 index, so whatever problem exists is inconsistent Yahoo also agrees with itself for VFINX, but comes in a bit low even if your assume no reinvestment of dividends 68 vs. 78 expected Im not sure if its ever right. By way of comparison, TDs chart for VFINX seems to be consistent with its ABALX chart and with reality As a final sanity check, I pulled historical GSPC prices from Yahoo Finance. It closed at 1406.58 on 27 Aug 2012 and 2477.55 on 28 Aug 2017, or 76.1 growth overall. That agrees with TD and the return calculator above, and disagrees with CNN Money on ABALX. Worse, Yahoos own charts both ABALX and VFINX disagree with Yahoos own historical data."

    "content": "If you exceed the income limit for deducting a traditional IRA which is very low if you are covered by a 401k , then your IRA options are basically limited to a Roth IRA. The Cramer person probably meant to compare 401k and IRA from the same preposttaxness, so i.e. Traditional 401k vs. Traditional IRA, or Roth 401k vs. Roth IRA. Comparing a Roth investment against a Traditional investment goes into a whole other topic that only confuses what is being discussed here. So if deducting a traditional IRA is ruled out, then I dont think Cramers advice can be as simply applied regarding a Traditional 401k. However, by that logic, and since most people on 401k have Traditional 401k, and if you are covered by a 401k then you cannot deduct a Traditional IRA unless you are super low income, that would mean Cramers advice is not applicable in most situations. So I dont really know what to think here."

Keep in mind, some companies go public in a way that takes the shares that are held by the investment VCs venture capitalists and cashes them out of their positions, i.e. most if not all shares are made public. In that case, the day after IPO, the original investors have their money, and, short of the risk of being sued for fraud, could not care less what the stock does. Other companies float a small portion up front, and retain the rest. This is a way of creating a market and valuing the company, but not floating so many shares the market has trouble absorbing it. This stock has a \"Shares Outstanding\" of 2.74B but has only floated 757.21M. The nearly 2 billion shares held by the original investors certainly impact their wallets with how this IPO went.

Earnings are not subject to federal tax and generally not subject to state tax when used for the qualified education expenses of the designated beneficiary, such as tuition, fees, books, as well as room and board. Contributions to a 529 plan, however, are not deductible. If it is a 529 associated with your state you can also save on state taxes. You can make contributions on a regular basis, or ad hoc. Accounts can even be setup by other relatives. I have used a 529 to fund two kids education. It takes care of most of your education expenses. 529 programs are available from most states, and even some of the big mutual fund companies. Many have the option of shifting the risk level of the investments to be more conservative as the kids hit high school. Some states have an option to have you pay a large sum when the child is small to buy semesters of college. The deal is worth considering if you know they will be going to a state school, the deal is less good if they will go out of state or to a private college. The IRS does limit the maximum amount that you can contribute in a year an amount that exceeds the 14,000 annual gift limit If in 2014, you contributed more than 14,000 to a Qualified Tuition Plan QTP on behalf of any one person, you may elect to treat up to 70,000 of the contribution for that person as if you had made it ratably over a 5year period. The election allows you to apply the annual exclusion to a portion of the contribution in each of the 5 years, beginning in 2014. You can make this election for as many separate people as you made QTP contributions One option at the end is to take any extra money at graduation and give it to the child so that it can be used for graduate school, or if the taxes and penalties are paid it can be used for that first car.

So, to determine what you have earned on the 40K you leveraged 5x, wouldnt it be a matter of computing a CAGR that gets you from 40K to 200K in 30 years?

However, in this case, we must also factor in how much your contracting brings in since you must pay income tax on that, as well as Medicare and, probably, Social Security, whether you are filing jointly or separately, and your wifes income from her business. There are also other factors such as whether youll be claiming certain child care expenses, and certain tax credits which may phase out depending on your income. If you can accurately estimate your total household income for the year, and separate that into income from wages, contracting, and your wifes business, as well as your expenses for things like state and local income and property taxes, then you can make a very reasonable estimate about your total tax burden including the selfemployment taxes on your nonwage income and then determine whether you are having enough tax withheld from your paycheck.

You say \"more shares\", so it sounds like youve already invested some money and need to inject another round. If you make a loan to the company, make sure everything is done at arms length  youll need to wear the hat of the Company Management and sign a contract with yourself, use a marketbased interest rate, and make sure the company is paying you back with interest. An alternative which may work if you expect cash flow soon is to pay for certain expenses personally and then submit an expense report to the company, which will pay you back.

Pro tip Its actually quite easy to outdo the market at large over the short term just by getting lucky or investing in risky askets in a good year. Earning this sort of return consistently over many years, though, is stupidly hard. Usually youll wipe out your gains several years into the process, instead. The stock market fluctuates like crazy, which is why they tell you not to invest any money youre likely to need sooner than about 5 years out and you switch your portfolio from stocks to bonds as you approach and enter retirement. The traditional benchmark for comparison, as others have mentioned, is the rate of return including dividends from the Standard and Poors 500 Index.

Of course, over the rest of your working life your salary will likely increase due to inflation too, so that will help. In 1980 the average US income was around 19Kyear.

If the nonprofit doesnt want to accept the money with those strings they can refuse. Generally these specific projects are initiated by the nonprofit. But there is no requirement that the idea originate with the nonprofit. It is also up to the nonprofit and their legal advisers regarding how strictly they view those strings. If you donate money for web design and they dont spend it all, can they pay net years hosting bill with the money, or must they hold it for a few years for when they need a designer again? If the company wants to provide the service, they can structure the project to pay their employees for their time. They pay employees for 100 of labor while deigning the website. The pay and benefits reduce profit thus lowering taxes. Donating money to the nonprofit to be given back to the company doesnt seem to be the best way to structure transaction. At best it is a wash.

If they are, would this mean that stock prices completely depend on HOW the public FEELSTHINKS about the stock instead of what it is actually worth? This is a question people have argued for decades. Literature in behavioral finance suggests that investors are not rational and thus markets are subject to wild fluctuation based on investor sentiment. The efficient market theory EMT argues that the stock market is efficient and that a stocks price is an accurate reflection of its underlying or intrinsic value. This philosophy took birth with Harry Markovitzs efficient frontier, and Eugene Fama is generally seen as the champion of EMT in the 1960s and onward. Most investors today would agree that the markets are not perfectly efficient, and that a stocks price does not always reflect its value. The renowned professor Benjamin Graham once wrote In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine. This suggests that prices in the short term are mainly influenced by how people feel about the stock, while in the long run the price reflects what its actually worth. For example, people are really big fans of tech stocks right now, which suggests why LinkedIn stock LNKD has such a high share price despite its modest earnings relative to valuation. People feel really good about it, and the price might sustain if LinkedIn becomes more and more profitable, but its also possible that their results wont be absolutely stellar, so the stock price will fall until it reflects the companys fundamentals."

So your net loss or gain is the rental income minus the interest youre paying on your home. From a cash flow perspective, youd gain the difference between the rental income and your total payment. Any excess proceeds from selling the flat and paying off the mortgage could be saved and use later to buy another rental for \"retirement income\". Or just invest in a retirement account and leave it alone. Selling the flat also gets rid of any extra time spent managing the property. If you keep the flat, youll need a mortgage of 105K to 150K plus closing costs depending on the cost of the house you buy, so your mortgage payment will increase by 25100. My fist choice would be to sell the flat and buy your new house debtfree or with a very small mortgage. Youre only making 6 on it, and your mortgage payment is going to be higher since youll need to borrow about 160k if you want to keep the flat and buy a 450K house, so youre no longer cashflow neutral.

Whatever you do, dont assume they have your best interests at heart. Do not assume that \"no news is good news\" and that if you arent hearing of problems and are just collecting rent checks, everything must be fine. You can easily end up with tenants you would never have allowed yourself, or tenants with pets that you would not have allowed, etc. Especially if the manager doesnt want you to have a vacancy and potentially lose you as a client, they may very well lower their standards just to get the place occupied. And a year or two or three later, you may find yourself looking at a very large repair bill and wonder how on earth it could have happened when you supposedly had someone looking out for your property! There are quality, ethical property managers out there. They are not all bad to be certain. But whatever you do, check up on them. And with multiple properties  especially if in multiple areasstates etc.  this can be nearly a full time job in itself. As the saying goes, \"Trust, but verify\". I have never found this to apply more than with rental properties and property management. Dont leave anything significant to them 100. You cant even assume that a rule like \"all expenses over 50 must be cleared by me first\", as that can simply mean that they dont bother to come to you for certain kinds of repairs that would cost more than that, or that they just get them \"taken care of\" by their own person done poorly, illegally, etc. and never tell you. Never trust their choice of tenants blindly. Visit the place yourself at least every few months  a quick driveby at a minimum or better if you can, arrange a reason to walk through the house personally. Check the back yard, never assume that the front yard is indicative of anything else. Never assume that a \"no pets\" rule will be followed, or that tenants wouldnt lie to the management about having pets. Never assume that the tenants wont move additional people into the property as well. Always expect a bare minimum of 1 month vacancy every year, and an additional minimum of 1 months rental revenue in unexpected maintenancerepairs every year. This is at a minimum! You might do much better than this, and have a high quality tenant in place for years who costs next to nothing in extra maintenance. But do not count on it. Rental real estate investing looks so simple on paper, where its just numbers. But reality has a very rude habit of surprising you when you least expect it.

Why are there people who cant contribute to a Roth IRA directly but can contribute to a Traditional and then immediately convert it to Roth? Why are maximum limits for 401k plans and IRAs separate rather than being one combined \"retirement\" savings maximum? In the absence of some specific legislative statements saying that it was set up this way for some specific purpose, one must assume that it was written with the some goals as all tax law As a compromise between various ideas, trying to accomplish some specific purpose. Feel free to add in some level of inefficiency and it being hard to completely understand the entirely of the tax law, which leads to things perhaps not being as \"tidy\" as one might hope for.

A family that has only one son and any number of daughters, or a family that has only one daughter and any number of sons, stands to lose an obvious part of their genetic and cultural legacy if they lose that son or daughter. It is expensive to conceive, bear, and raise a child to a particular age. This cost increases as the child ages. The number of years of childraising cost obviously increases.

If youre feeling insecure about your shortterm job longevity and midcareer prospects, you will likely benefit from a thoughtful and robust emergency fund plan. Your retirement plan is really designed to fund your life after work, so the usual advice to contribute as much as you can as early as you can applies either way. While a wellfunded retirement portfolio will help you feel generally more secure in the long run and worst case can be used earlier, a good emergency fund will do more to address your nearterm concerns. Both retirement and emergency fund planning are fundamental to a comprehensive personal finance plan. This post on StackExchange has some basic info about your retirement options. Given your spare income, you should be able to fully fund an IRA and your 401K every year with some left over. Check the fees in your 401K to determine if you really want to fully fund the 401K past employer matching. There are several good answers and info about that here. Lowcost mutual funds are a good choice for starting your IRA. There is a lot of different advice about emergency funds check here ranging from x months salary in savings to detailed planning for each of your expenses. Regardless of which method you chose, it is important to think about your personal risk tolerance and create a plan that addresses your personal needs. Its difficult to live life and perform well at work if youre always worried about your situation. A good emergency plan should go a long way toward calming those fears. Your concern about reaching midlife and becoming obsolete or unable to keep up in your career may be premature. Of course your mind, body, and your abilities will change over the years, but it is very difficult to predict where you will be, what you will be doing, and whether your experience will offset any potential decrease in your ability to keep up. Its good to think ahead and consider the \"whatifs\", but keep in mind that those scenarios are not preordained. There isnt anything special about being 40 that will force you into a different line of work if you dont want to switch."

Unless you already have some kind of substantial track record of successful investing to show potential investors, what you want to do will never happen, and thats just giving you the honest truth. There are extensive regulatory requirements for starting any kind of public investment vehicle, and meeting them costs money. You can be your own hedge fund with your own money and avoid all of this if you like. Keep in mind that a \"hedge fund\" is little more than someone who is contrarian to the market and puts their money where their mouth is. I know, some of you will argue this is simplistic, and youd be right, but Im deliberately avoiding complexity for the moment The simple truth is that nobody is going to just give you their money to invest unless, for starters, you can show that youre any good at it and for the sake of it well assume youve had success in the markets, and perhaps most importantly you have \"skin in the game\", meaning you have a substantial investment of your own in the fund too. You might have a chance at creating something if you can show that whatever your hedge fund proposes to invest in isnt already overrun by other hedge funds. At the moment, there are more mutual and hedge funds out there than there are securities for them to invest in, so theyre basically all fighting over the same pie. You must have some fairly unique opportunity or approach that nobody else has or has even considered in order to begin attracting money to a new fund these days. And thats not easy, trust me. There is no short or easy path to what you want to do, and perhaps if you want to toy around with it a bit, find some friends who are willing to invest based on your advice andor picks. If you develop a track record of success then perhaps you could more seriously consider doing what you propose, and in the meanwhile you can look into the requirements for laying the foundations toward your goal. I hope you dont find my answer cruel, because it isnt meant to be. I am all about encouraging people to succeed, but it has to start with a realistic expectation. You have a great thought, but theres a wide gulf from concept to market and no quick or simple way to bridge it.

Rolling them over is not hard, if you have paperwork from each of the 401ks. You might be able to DIY online, but I found it helpful to call and talk to a person when I did this.

In this case, the corporation is offering new ownership in exchange for a price set the corporation or a broker hired by the corporation. The price used for a public offering is the highest amount that the company believes it can get  this is a very complicated field, and involves many different methods of evaluating what the company should be worth. If the company sets the price too low, then they have missed out on possible value which would be earned by the previous, private shareholders they would have gotten the same share  of a corporation which would now have more cash to spend, because of increased money paid by new shareholders. If the company sets the price too high, then the share subscription might only be partially filled, so there might not be enough cash to do what the company wanted. You can buy a share from another shareholder. This is more common  when you see the companys share price on the stock exchange, it is this type of transaction  buying out other current shareholders. The price here is simply set based on what current owners are willing to sell at. The \"Bid Price\" listed by an exchange is the current highest bid that a purchaser is offering for a single share. The \"Ask Price\" is the current lowest offer that a seller is offering to sell a single share they currently own.

    "topic": "Why are bank transactions not instant?",
    "content": "It is a rather complex system, but here is a rough summary. Interbank tranfers ultimately require a transfer of reserves at the central bank. As a concrete example, the bank of england system is the rtgs. Only the clearing banks and similar e.g. bacs have access to rtgs. You can send a chaps payment fairly quickly, but that costs. Chaps immediately triggers an rtgs transfer once the sending bank agrees and so you can be certain that the money is being paid. Hence its use for large amounts. Bacs also sits on the rtgs but to keep costs down it batches tranfers up. Because we are talking about bank reserve movements, checks have to be in place and that can take time. Furthermore the potential for fraud is higher than chaps since these are aggregrated transactions a layer removed, so a delay reduces the chance of payment failing after apparently being sent. Faster payments is a new product by bacs that speeds up the bacs process by doing a number of transfers per day. Hence the two hour clearing. For safety it can only be used for up to 10k. Second tier banks will hold accounts with clearing banks so they are another step down. Foreign currency transfers require the foreign Central Bank reserve somewhere, and so must be mediated by at least one clearing bank in that country. Different countries are at different stages in their technology. Uk clearing is 2h standard now but US is a little behind I believe. Much of Europe is speeding up. Rather like bitcoin clearing, you have a choice between speed and safety. If you wait you are more certain the transaction is sound and have more time to bust the transfer."

Depending on the specifics, they may also make buying small amounts practical buying small amounts of physical precious metals usually comes with a large markup over the spot price, sometimes to the tune of a 50 or so immediate loss if you buy and then immediately sell. Do note that, as pointed out by John Bensin, buying gold gets you an amount of metal, the local currency value of which will vary over time, sometimes wildly, so it is not the same thing as depositing the original amount of money in a bank account.

Very often, employees with lower income save overproportionally less in their 401k, and there is a line where the 401k plan is no longer acceptable to the IRS. HCE is a way for companies to ensure this forced balance by limiting the amount of 401k savings for HCE, the companies ensure that the share of all contributions by belowHCE is appropriate. They will calculatedefine the HCE cutoff point so that the required distribution is surely achieved. One of the consequences is that when you move over the HCE cutoff point, you can suddenly save a lot less in your 401k. Nothing can be done about that.

Some of it might be buying bonds. The exact mix of stocks and bonds depends on the mutual fund. But a mutual fund is just a basket of stocks andor bonds andor other, more exotic investments. At 25, you probably should just be investing your Roth IRA in index stock mutual funds and index bond mutual funds. You probably shouldnt even be doing peertopeer lending unless youre willing to think of any losses as the cost of a hobby the higher interest rate youre getting is a reflection of the risk that your borrowers will default. Im not even sure if peertopeer lending is allowed in Roth IRAs. Investing in just stocks, bonds, and cast is boring, but these are easy investments to understand. The harder the investment is to understand, the easier it is for it to be a scam or just a bad investment. Theres not necessarily anything wrong with boring."

If you have 2 bonds maturing in 3 years of the same face value and same risk categories though one is paying 5 and the other is paying 10 then it may be that the 5 sells at a discount to bring the yield up some while the other sells at a premium to bring the yield down.

These stockholders then receive the declared dividend on date C, the socalled payment date. All of these dates are announced on the first declaration date. If there is no announcement, no dividend will be paid. The stock typically goes down in price by approximately the amount of the dividend on the date it \"goes ex,\" but then moves in price to reflect other developments, including the possibility of another declarationpayment, three months hence. Dividends are important to some investors, especially those who live on the income. They are less important to investors who are out for capital gains and who may prefer that the company reinvest its money to seek such gains instead of paying dividends. In actual fact, dividends are one component of \"total\" or overall return. The other component is capital gains, and the sum of the two represents your return."

Note that you will have to sell the future at some day before it runs out, or you get real oil in some harbor somewhere for it, which might not be very useful to you. As most traders dont want really any oil, that might happen automatically or by default, but you need to make sure of that. Note also that worst case you could lose a lot more money than you put in  if you buy a future to deliver oil for 50 , and the oil price runs, you will have to procure the oil for new price, meaning pay the current price for it.

I wrote a lengthy article on this in response to a friend who had a loan, but was also pondering a home purchase in the future. Student Loans and Your First Mortgage discusses the math behind ones ability to put a downpayment on a house vs having that monthly cash to pay towards the mortgage. In your case, the question is whether, in 5 years, the 8500 would be best spent as a home down payment or to pay off the 6.8 loan. If you specifically had plans toward home ownership, the timing of that plan would affect my answer here, as I discuss in the article. The right answer to your question can only come by knowing far more of your personal situation. Meanwhile, the plan comes at a cost. Your plan will get rid of the loan in about 5 years, but if you simply double up the payments, advising the servicing company to apply the extra to principal, it would drop to just a couple month over over 4. As you read more about personal finance, youll find a lot of different views. Some people are fixated on having zero debt, others will focus on liquidity.

MMs price spread can be larger than bidask spread only when there are multiple market makers and different market makers are providing different bidasks. As long as the MM under question gives bid and ask within exchanges rules, it can be fine. These are usually rare situations. One advice please carefully check the timestamps. I have seen many occasions when tick data timestamps between different vendors are mismatched in databases whereas in real life it isnt. MMs profits not just from spreads, but also from short term meanreversion fading.

If Person A buys 100 shares of a stock with the intent of selling them in a few hours, and Person B buys 100 shares of the same stock with the intent of holding on to it for a year, then obviously at that point they both have the same risk. The difference comes over the course of the year. First, Person B is going to be making money from the economic value the company provides over the whole year, while the only way Person A can make money is from market fluctuation the economic value the company provides over the course of an hour is unlikely to be significant. Person B is exposed to the risk of buying the stock, but thats counterbalanced by the profit from holding the stock for a year, while Person A just has the risk. Second, if Person A is buying a new stock every hour, then theyre going to have thousands of transactions. So even though Person B assumed just as much risk as Person A for that one transaction, Person A has more total risk."

    "content": "One reason why you can get a better rate with a CD compared to a regular savings account is that they lock you into that account for the period of the CD. You can get out of the CD early, but you will forfeit some of the interest. You also generally cant move a portion of the money out of the CD, you have to pull it all out, and then start a new CD with the portion you dont spend. You have to check the terms and conditions for that particular CD. Some people use them to hold their emergency fund. This is the 36 months of expenses you set aside in case of a major problem such as a medical emergency or a job loss. The rate is better than the regular savings account, so it can come closer to inflation. The goal is preservation of capital, not investing for the future. So if you understand the risks, and the CD is backed with the same guarantees as the savings account, then it is a viable way to store some or all of the emergency fund."

    "content": "Im going to start with your title question How can home buying be considered a sound investment with all of that interest that needs to be paid? If taken literally, this is a loaded question because if you pay cash for a home, you dont pay any interest. Furthermore, if your interest rate is 3 for 10 years you wont pay nearly as much interest as you will if your rate is 10 for 30 years, so \"all of that interest\" is relative to your personal situation. Having said that, of course I understand what you mean. Most people pay interest, and interest is expensive, so how do you calculate if its worth it? That question has been asked and answered, but for your particular situation, you really have two separate questions I believe you should answer these questions independently. If you move far away, its probably the case that you can save a lot of money by either renting or buying in that location. So you should first consider if its worth it to move, and then if it is, decide if its worth it to rent or buy. If you decide not to move far away, then decide if maybe you can save money by renting somewhere near your current home. Since it sounds like if you move you may have to become a landlord, living close by to your tenant may also make it easier to deal with problems when they arise."

You are correct though Pfizer might be considered \"more growth.\" A more drastic example would be the difference between Target and Amazon. Both are retail companies that sell a wide variety of products. Target is a value company a established company with stable revenues that uses its income to give a fairly stable dividend. Amazon is a growth company that is reinvesting its revenues back into the corporation to grow itself as fast as possible. The price of the Amazon stock reflects what people think will be future growth future income for the company. Whereas Targets price appears to be based on the idea that future income will be similar to current income. You can see why growth companies like Amazon might be more risky as that growth you paid a high price for may not be realized, but the payout may be much higher as well."

    "topic": "Why are the administrative fees for the three biggest donoradvised funds identical?",
    "content": "The commenters who referred you to the prisoners dilemma are exactly correct, but I wanted to give a more detailed explanation because I find game theory quite interesting. The prisoners dilemma is a classic scenario in game theory where even though its in the best interests of two or more players to cooperate, they fail to do so. Wikipedia has a simple example using prisoners, but Ill use a simple example using Fidel and Charles, who are fund managers at Fidelity and Charles Schwab, respectively. To make the table shorter, I abbreviated a bit INC  increase fees, KEEPkeep fees the same, DECdecrease fees. Here is the dilemma itself, in the table that shows the resulting market shares if each fund manager follows the course of action in question. While this example isnt mathematically rigorous because I completely fabricated the numbers, it makes a good example. The most profitable course of action would be both fund managers agreeing to increase their fees, which would keep their market shares the same but increase their profits as they earn more fees. However, this wont happen for several reasons. Because economies of scale exist in the market for investment funds, its reasonable to assume in a simple example that as funds grow larger, their costs decrease, so even though a fund manager decreases his fees betraying the other players, this decrease wont be enough to reduce their profits. In fact, the increased market share resulting from such a decrease may well dominate the decreased fees and lead to higher profits. The prisoners dilemma is highly applicable to markets such as these because they exist as oligopolies, i.e. markets where a relatively small number of established sellers possess considerable market power. If you actually wanted to model the market for donoradvised funds using game theory, you need to take a few more things into account. Obviously there are more than two firms. Its probably a valid assumption that the market is an oligopoly with significant economies of scale, but I havent researched this extensively. There is more than one time period, so some form of the iterated prisoners dilemma is needed. The market for donoradvised funds is also complicated by the fact that these are philanthropic funds. This may introduce tax implications or the problem of goodwill and institutional opinion of these funds. Although both funds increasing their fees may increase their profits in theory, institutional investors may look on this as a pure profitseeking and take their funds elsewhere. For example, they may choose to invest in smaller funds with higher fees but better reputations. While reputation is important for any company, it might make more of a difference when the fundinvestment vehicle is philanthropic in nature. I am by no means an expert on game theory, so Im sure there are other nuances to the situation that Im unaware of."

    "topic": "Is there a good strategy to invest when two stock companies either merge or acquisition?",
    "content": "Theres an old adage in the equities business  \"buy on rumor, sell on fact\". Sometimes the strategy is to buy as soon as the rumor is out about a potential merger and then sell off into the news when it is actually announced, since this is normally when the biggest bounce occurs as part of a merger. The other part of the analysis you should do is to understand which of the companies benefits most or is hurt the worst by the merger and then make your play accordingly. Sometimes the company being acquired will see a bounce while the acquiring firm takes a hit, which is an indication the experts think the acquisition will be a drag on the acquiring company perhaps because it is taking on a great deal of debt to make the acquisition, or because the acquiring firm is paying too much of a premium for what its getting in return. Other times the exact opposite is true, where the company being acquired takes a hit while the buyer bounces, and again, the reasons for this can vary widely. If you wait until the merger is actually announced then by the time you get in, most of the premium from the announcement will likely have already been realized, and youll be buying near the top of the market for the stock. The key is to be ahead of the other sellers by seeing the opportunities before they do and then knowing when to get out before everyone else does. Not an easy thing to pull off when youre trying to anticipate the markets, but it can be done if you do the right research and have patience. Good luck!"

    "content": "I think you should really start a limited company for this. Itll be a lot simpler to spread the income over multiple years if your business and you have completely separate identities. You should also consult an accountant, if only once to understand the basics of how to approach this. Having a limited company would also mean that if it has financial problems, you dont end up having to pay the debts yourself. With a separate company, you would keep any money raised within the company initially and only pay it to yourself as salary over the three years, so from an income tax point of view youd only be taxed on it as you received it. The company would also pay for project expenses directly and there wouldnt be any income tax to pay on them at all. You would have to pay other taxes like VAT, but you could choose to register for VAT and then youd be able to reclaim VAT on the companys expenses but would have to charge VAT to your customers. If you start making enough money currently 82,000year you have to register for VAT whether you want to or not. The only slight complication might be that you could be subject to corporation tax on the surplus money in the first year because it might seem like a profit. However, given that you would presumably have promised something to the funders over a three year period, it should be possible to record your promises as a \"liability\" for \"unearned income\" in the company accounts. In effect youd be saying \"although theres still 60,000 in the bank, I have promised to spend it on the crowdfunded thing so its not profit\".

If you know why the numbers are weird and you feel that the reason for it bodes ill about the future, and if you think theres a reason this has not been accounted for by the market, then you might think about selling. The stocks performance will depend on what happens in the future. Financials just document the past, and are subject to all kinds of lumpiness, seasonality, and manipulation. You might benefit from posting a link to where you got your financials. Whenever one computes something like a dividend payout ratio, one must select a time period over which to measure. If the company had a rough quarter in terms of earnings but chose not to reduce dividends because they dont expect the future to be rough, that would explain a crazy high dividend ratio. Or if they were changing their capital structure. Or one of many other potentially benign things. Accounting numbers summarize a ton of complex workings of the company and many ratios we look at could be defined in several different ways.

For example if you have a Fidelity brokerage account, they may let you buy certain ETFs commission free. Okay then either ETFs make great sense. It would not make sense to buy ones that they charge 35 per transaction if you have regular transactions that are smallish. The last two questions seem to be asking if you should buy MF or buy stocks directly. For most people the later is a losing proposition.

    "topic": "If I were to get into a life situation where I would not be able to make regular payments, do lenders typically provide options other than default?",
    "content": "For insight on what will happen, I suggest looking at the situation from the lenders perspective If your setbacks are temporary, and you are likely to get back on your feet again, they will protect their investment by making accommodations, and probably charging you extra fees along the way. If your financial hardship seems irredeemable, they probably try to squeeze you for as much as possible, and then eventually take your house, protecting their investment as best they can. If they are going to foreclose, they may be reluctant to do it quickly, as foreclosure is expensive, takes man power, and looks bad on their books. So it may get pushed off for a Quarter, or a fiscal year. But if you are asking if theyll help you out from the goodness of their heart, well, a bank has no heart, and creditors are interested in ROI. Theyll take the easiest path to profit, or failing that, the path to minimum financial losses. The personal consequences to you are not their concern. Once you realize this, it may change your thinking about your own situation. If you think you have a path to financial recovery, then you need to make that clear to them, in writing, with details. Make a business case that working with you is in their own best interests. If you cannot make such a case, recognize that theyll likely squeeze you for as much as possible in penalties, fees, interest payments, etc, before eventually foreclosing on you anyway. Dont play that game. If your home is a lost cause financially, plan how to get out from it with the smallest losses possible. Dont pay more than you need to, and dont throw good money after bad."

I wouldnt be surprised if some medical professionals such as surgeons check it also. Obviously if you have a mortgage and car loan this doesnt apply, but Id be curious how you acquired those unless you have substantial income andor assets. Combine this with the fact that certain things like renting a car essentially require a credit card because they need to put a hold on more money than they are actually going to take out of your card, so they can take that money if you dont bring the car back, and I think you should have a credit card unless you and your wife are individuals with zero impulse control, which sounds highly improbable. If your concern is the financial liability of the credit line, just keep the credit line low."

After discussing with many in the real estate world, I counted the average and learned that most averaged about 6  8 on real estate after taxes. This does not include anything else like Dilip mentions maintenance, insurance, etc. For those who want to avoid that route, you can buy some companies that invest in real estate or REIT funds like Dilip mentions. However, they are also susceptible to the problems mentioned above this. In terms of other investment opportunities like stocks or funds, think about businesses that will always be around and will always be needed.

    "topic": "Whats the best way to make money from a market correction?",
    "content": "There are several ways to protect against or even profit from a market correction. Hedge funds do this by hedging, that is, buying a stock that they think is strong and selling short a paired stock that is weak. If you hold, say, a strong retail company in your portfolio, you might sell short an equal weight of a weak retail company. These are like buying insurance on your portfolio. If you own 300 shares of XYZ, currently trading at 68, you buy puts at a level at a strike price that lets you sleep at night. For example, you might buy 3 XYZ 6month puts with a strike price of 60. A disadvantage is that the puts are wasting assets, that is, their time premium which you paid for at the outset becomes zero at expiration. This is why it is like insurance. You wouldnt complain that your insurance premium was lost when you purchase insurance on your house and the house doesnt burn down, would you? Of course not. The purpose of the insurance is to protect your investment. Note that as these puts are married, they only protect your portfolio. Instead of profiting from a correction, you would merely protect your portfolio during a correction. No small feat! If your portfolio is similar to the market, you can buy SP index puts. If your market reflects a lot of technology, you can buy technology sector puts. Say you have a portfolio of 80K that reflects the market. You could buy outofthemarket puts again reflecting your tolerance for loss. Any losses in your portfolio after the puts go inthemoney would be more or less offset by gains in the puts. An advantage is that the bidask spread is smaller for the SP. You would pay less for the protection. Also, the SP puts are cash settled meaning you get money put in your account on the business day after expiration day. A disadvantage is that the puts do not linearly go up as the market drops. Delta hedging is a big deal in and of itself. Another disadvantage is that they are wasting assets see the Married puts section, previous. While the SP puts can be used to maintain your market portfolio in the midst of a correction, you could purchase more puts than needed. If you had correctly timed the market, then your portfolio with puts would increase. Your mileage may vary some have predicted an imminent market crash way too often. Collars involve selling outofthemoney calls and using the premiums to buy outofthemoney puts. There are many varieties of collars, but the most straightforward is to sell 1 call and buy 1 put for every 100 shares. This can also be done for index puts and calls. This has the effect of simultaneously You get your insurance for almost free. But again, it is protecting your portfolio. As the name implies, you make money when the market goes bearish. Bear put spreads involve buying puts at a close strike price and selling an equal number of puts at a lower strike price than the first. You have a defined maximum loss the premium you paid for the higher put minus the premium you received for the lower put. You have a defined maximum gain the difference between strikes minus the defined maximum loss. Buy SP 500 index puts. If you buy deep outofthemoney puts, it wont cost much, but you have little probability of it paying off. But if they go inthemoney, there could be a sizable payoff. This is similar to putting one chip on red 18 on the roulette wheel. But rather than paying off 351, it is a variable payoff. If youre 1 in the money, you just get 100. If youre 12 in the money, you have a 1200 payoff. If you buy atthemoney puts, it will cost a lot, and your probability will be about 1 in 2 that you will pay off. In our roulette analogy, this is like putting 30 chips on the Even bet of the roulette wheel. The variable payoff is as in the previous paragraph. But youre more likely to get a payoff. And you will lose it all of the roulette ball lands on an Odd number, 0, or 00. That is, the underlying of your put goes up or stays the same. If your research shows you what good stocks to buy, it may also tell you which stocks are ripe for a fall. You could shortsell these stocks or buy puts on them. Similar to shortselling stocks or buying puts, you could sell short overpriced sectors or buy puts on them. There are ETFs that will allow you benefit from falling prices without needing to have a margin agreement or options agreement in place. Sorry to have a lengthy answer. Many other answers emphasize that one shouldnt try to time the market. But that is not the OPs question. Provided here are both"

That means Buy something where it is likely that you can resell it at the same price or even higher  or, at the least for significantly more than \"total cost of ownership  rent payed elsewhere\". For example, if it is in an area where you have good reasons to assume that prices will go up in the future. Or if the object needs refurbishing and you are sure that you can do it yourself. You will, no doubt, sell it later. You will near certainly not live in such a small house for all time. So the question of \"whether\" you will sell it is moot. So, when you have a potential house to buy, you will have to calculate everything very carefully, with an estimate of how long you will stay. You need to make your calculation as optimisticpessimistic as you like this is more a question of your character. Whatever calculation comes out better, wins. It goes without saying that if you miscalculate for example, overestimating your ability or time to refurbish forgetting to calculate nonobvious costs of refurbishing being surprised by hidden damage to the object misjudging the price development in the area you run a considerable risk. So, the question of whether you are able to calculate the risks correctly will need to influence the calculation itself add 20 or whatever risk buffer if you are not sure, etc.. But the potential is for you to have a very good start in the whole financial game of your life. Your house will likely be for a considerable time the biggest single part of costs in your life, and getting that under control from the getgo is a huge benefit."

Examples If you can find partners with the money to make the deals happen, then your job is to put the deal together. Find the properties, negotiate the price, even get the property under contract all without any obligation or cost on your part... yes it absolutely can be done. Then your partners will fund the deal if its good enough and their terms are met, etc. In some areas you can put a property on a credit card. If you find a house say for 25,000 that will rent for 300month, and you can put it on a credit card especially at zero percent for a year or something similar, then you can generate cashflow as a landlord without putting up any cash of your own on the purchase. Of course there are many risks associated with landlording and i could tell you horror stories... but were not addressing that here. You can negotiate a sale with an owner who agrees to finance the entire purchase for you. I once purchased 3 properties at once this way from a seller who financed the entire sale, all closing costs, everything, this way. Of course they needed a lot of repair and such so I had to fund that another way, but at least the purchase itself cost me no money out of pocket. So these infomercialscourses are not inherently scams in the sense that what they are teaching is usually... Im sure there are exceptions true.

Second, if your assumption is valid, here are a few ideas how it might work Accumulate slowly, exit slowly. This wont work for shortterm swings, but if you feel like a lowvolume stock will be a longerterm winner, you can accumulate a sizable portion in small enough chunks not to swing the price and then slowly unwind your position when the price has increased sufficiently. Create additional buyerssellers. Your frustration may be one of the reasons lowvolume stock is so full of scammers pumping and dumping read any investing message board to see examples of this. If you can scare holders of the stock into selling, you can buy significant portions without driving the stock price up. Similarly, if you can convince people to buy the stock, you can unload without destroying the price. This is of course morally and legally dubious, so I would not recommend this practice."

    "topic": "How much do large sell orders affect stock price?",
    "content": "Most of the investors who have large holdings in a particular stock have pretty good exit strategies for those positions to ensure they are getting the best price they can by selling gradually into the volume over time. Putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason Lets say you have 100,000 shares of a stock, and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them, take your profits, and ride off into the sunset. So you call your broker or log into your brokerage account and put them up for sale. He puts in an order somewhere, the stock is sold, and your account is credited. Seems simple, right? Well...not so fast. Professionals  Im keeping this simple, so please dont beat me up for it! The way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as \"market makers\". These are entities which sit between the markets and you and your broker, and when you want to buy or sell a stock, most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker. If you work with a large brokerage firm, sometimes theyll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts, but thats another story. It is normal for there to be many, sometimes hundreds, of market makers who are all trading in the same equity. The bigger the stock, the more market makers it attracts. They all compete with each other for business, and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it. Given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock Google, Apple, and Microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks, it is very competitive. The way the makers compete is on price. It might surprise you to know that it is the market makers, not the markets, that decide what a stock will buy or sell for. Each market maker sets their own prices for what theyll pay to buy from sellers for, and what theyll sell it to buyers for. This is called, respectively, the \"bid\" and the \"ask\" prices. So, if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock. The prices you see for stocks are what are called the \"best bid and best ask\" prices. What that means is, you are being shown the highest \"bid\" price what you can sell your shares for and the best \"ask\" price what you can buy those shares for because thats what is required. That being said, there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher. Many times there will be a big clump of market makers all at the same bidask, or within fractions of a cent of each other, all competing for business. Trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can. The point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at. They adjust those prices based among other factors on how much buying and selling volume theyre seeing. If they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then theyll start marking down their bid prices. This keeps them from paying too much for shares theyre going to have to find a buyer for eventually, and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell. Conversely, if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system, theyll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains, since theyre selling you shares they bought from someone else, presumably at a lower price. But they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades. sneaky, eh? Depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company youre selling, and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment, your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the shares price. If the block is large enough then its possible it will not all sell to one market maker, or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price. This is a pretty complex subject, as you can see, and Ive cut a LOT of corners and oversimplified much to keep it comprehensible. But the short answer to your question is  it depends. Hope this helps. Good luck!"

    "topic": "How are bonds affected by the Federal Funds Rate?",
    "content": "Ill answer your question, but first a comment about your intended strategy. Buying government bonds in a retirement account is probably not a good idea. Government bonds generally are tax advantaged themselves, so they offer a lower interest rate than other types of bonds. At no tax or reduced tax, many people will accept the lower interest rate because their effective return may be similar or better depending, for example, on their own marginal tax rate. In a taxadvantaged retirement account, however, youll be getting the lower interest without any additional benefit because that account itself is already taxadvantaged. Buying bonds generally may be a good idea or not  I wont comment on that  but choose a different category of bonds. For the general question about the relationship between the Fed rate and the bond rate, they are positively correlated. Theres not direct causal relationship in the sense that the Fed is not setting the bond rate directly, but other interest bearing investment options are tied to the Fed rate and many of those interestbearing options compete for the same investor dollars as the bonds that youre reviewing. Thats at a whole market level. Individual bonds, however, may not be so tightly coupled since the creditworthiness of the issuing entity matters a lot too, so it could be that \"bond rates\" generally are going up but some specific bonds are going down based on something happening with the issuer, just like the stock market might be generally going up even as specific stocks are dropping. Also keep in mind that many bonds trade as securities on a secondary market much like stocks. So Ive talked about the bond rate. The price of the bonds themselves on the secondary market generally move opposite to the rate. The reason is that, for example, if you buy a bond at less than face value, youre getting an effective interest rate thats higher because you get the same sized incremental payments of interest but put less money into the investment. And vice versa."

    "topic": "Whats are the differences between defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans?",
    "content": "As others have explained defined contribution is when you or your employer contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns. Defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount benefit and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it. Is one better than the other? We can argue this either way. Defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured. The problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount. If the employer fails in that responsibility, then the only fallback is government guarantees. And of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee. For example, from Wikipedia The maximum pension benefit guaranteed by PBGC is set by law and adjusted yearly. For plans that end in 2016, workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to 5,011.36 per month or 60,136 per year under PBGCs insurance program for singleemployer plans. Benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted actuarially, which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor, and higher for those who retire after age 65. Additionally, the PBGC will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the fiveyear period prior to a plans termination or benefits that are not payable over a retirees lifetime. Other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits, benefit increases within the last five years before a plans termination, and benefits earned after a plan sponsors bankruptcy. By contrast, people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts. So they control how much gets invested and where. Defined contribution accounts are always 100 funded. Defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded. They expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short. This allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement. But it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later, when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee. If you want someone else to make promises to you and arent worried that they wont keep them, you probably prefer defined benefit. If you want to have personal control over the money, you probably prefer defined contribution. My personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse. They encourage risky behavior and false promises. Defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation. Others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions."

In general if a lender gives you a GFE the numbers on it are going to be pretty accurate and there isnt a great deal of wiggle room for the lender so the concerns with reputation should focus on is this outfit some type of scam and then reviews on how good or bad their customer service is. Chances of running into a scam seem pretty low but the costs could be really high. As far as checking if an unknown lender is any good it is kind of tough to do.

    "topic": "If I put a large down payment over 50 towards a car loan, can I reduce my interest rate and is it smart to even put that much down?",
    "content": "The real answer is to talk to the bank. In the case of the last car loan I got, the answer is \"no\". When I asked them about rates, they gave me a printed sheet that listed the loan rates they offered based on how old the car was, period. I forget the exact numbers but it was like New car 4, 1 year old 4.5, 23 years old 5, etc. I suspect that at most banks these days, its not up to the loan officer to come up with what he considers reasonable terms for a loan based on whatever factors you may bring up and he agrees are relevant. The bank is going to have a set policy, under these conditions, this is the rate, and thats what you get. So if the bank includes the size of the down payment in their calculations, then yes, it will be relevant. If they dont, than it wont. The thing to do would be to ask your bank. If youre only borrowing 2000, and youve managed to save up 11,000, Id guess you can pay off the 2,000 pretty quickly. So as Keshlam says, the interest rate probably isnt all that important. If you can pay it off in a year, then the difference between 5 and 1 is only 80. If youre buying a 13,000 car, I cant imagine youre going to agonize over 80. BTW Ive bought two cars in the last few years with about half the cost in cash and putting the rest on my credit card. One for me and one for my daughter. Then I paid off the credit card in a couple of months. Sure, the interest rate on a credit card is much higher than a car loan, but as it was only for a few months, it made very little real difference, and it took zero effort to arrange the loan and gave me total flexibility in the repayment schedule. Credit card companies often offer convenience checks where you pay like 3 or so transaction fee and then 0 interest for a year or more, so it would just cost the 3 up front fee."

The recipient isnt required to be in the network, though if they are it makes things easier, as no setup is required on the recipients end in that case. Otherwise, they must sign up on the clearXchange site directly. From what I can tell, most payments are feefree within the network. I have repeating payments set up with Chases QuickPay, and they do not charge fees."

    "content": "You may have to both save your windfall in a savings account and use it to pay down your mortgage. Almost every mortgage has some sort of paydown option that allows you to pay off a percentage of the original principal without penalty. Any amounts above that will be penalized, most likely by the amount of interest the lending institution would have collected. Ask your lender what the penalties are and what penaltyfree paydown options you have. Knowing that and how much you will receive each quarter by selling the company stock will tell you how much of your money you need to put against your house and your savings account."

    "topic": "Mortgage refinancing",
    "content": "Check the terms of your mortgage. If you are in a fixedterm mortgage, you can likely \"overpay\" a fixed amount of the capital each year typically 10. Eg if you owe 300,000 on the mortgage, you can pay off an additional 30,000 this year. Next year youd owe something like 260,000 so could pay off 26,000. Youd need to check the terms of your mortgage to see what this limit is. You can actually pay off more than this, but would become liable to pay an \"early repayment fee\" or similar, which is usually something like 35 of the mortgage amount. Note that this usually means you would need to refinance the mortgage anyway If you are not on a fixedterm mortgage than, in the UK at least, you are pretty much free to overpay as much as you would like or refinance the mortgage. If you are in a fixedterm mortgage, it is usually better to simply overpay by that maximum allowed amount until the fixed period ends, at which point you can refinance onto a mortgage that allows higher overpayments. This isnt always the case, though, depending on your interest rate, how high the early repayment charge is, and how much you are able to overpay. At the very least, youre going to need to do some sums! If you do choose to overpay up to the limit, then youd want to overpay as much as you can at the start of the year ie dont divide the overpayment by 12, pay it all as early as you can to reduce interest payments. Then once you hit the limit, put the rest into a savings account once you are out of the fixed term you can then pay the rest as a lump sum when refinancing."

I then buy the 1 share and sell it to you for 90. You made 500 on the sale of the put, but lost 8900 when it went bad. You dont win either way, there is a chart you can construct or a table showing your profit or loss for every price of the underlying stock. When selling a put, you need to know what happens if the stock goes to zero since the odds of such an occurrence is nontrivial. A LEAP is already an option. With the new coding scheme for options, Im not sure theres really any distinction between a LEAP and standard option, the LEAP just starts with a longtillexpiration time.

Think about it logically. Take 2011 for example. The Govt spent 1.7 trillion more than it took in. This is real money that gets credited in to peoples bank accounts to purchase real goods and services. Now who purchases the majority of treasuries? The Primary Dealers. What are the Primary Dealers? They are banks. Where do banks get their money? From us. So now put two and two together. When the Govt spends 1.7 trillion and credits our bank accounts, the banking system has 1.7 trillion more. Then that money flows in to pension funds, gets spent in to corporation who then send that money to China for cheap products... and eventually the money spent purchases up Govt securities for investments. We had to physically give China 1 trillion dollars for them to be able to purchase 1 trillion dollars in securities. So it makes sense if you think about how the math works in the real world."

Deflation is what happens when you let air escape. Inflation may cause prices to go up. However there are many scenarios possible in which this does not happen. For example, at the same time of inflation, there might be unemployment, making consumers unable to pay higher prices. Or some important resource oil may go down in price due to political reasons, war has ended etc, compensating for the money having less value. Similarly, peoples wages will tend to rise over time. They have to, otherwise everyone would be earning less, due to inflation. However again there are many scenarios in which wages do not keep up with inflation, or rise much faster. In fact over the past 40 years or so, US wages have not been able to keep up with inflation, making the average worker poorer than 40 years ago. At its core, inflation refers to the value of the money itself. As all values of other products, services, assets etc are expressed in terms of money which itself also changes value, this can quickly become very complex. Most countries calculate inflation by averaging the price change of a basket of goods that are supposed to represent the average Joes spending pattern. However these methods are often criticized as they would be hiding inflation. The hidden inflation may come back later to bite us."

You need to remember that each transaction buysell has fees, which vary between 440 depending on the broker, you mentioned Scottrade  they charge 7 per transaction for stocks and about twice as much for some mutual funds. Consider this you invest 1000, you gain 100. Youll pay 15 in fees just to buysell, thats 1.5 expense ratio. If you invest in more than 1 stock  multiply your fees. To avoid that you can look into mutual funds. Different brokers offer different funds for free, and almost all of them carry many of the rest for a fee. When looking into funds, you can find their expense ratio and compare. Remember that a fund with 1 expense ratio diversifies and invests in many stocks, while for you 1.5 expense ratio is for investing in a single stock. Is it a good idea to invest only in US or diversify worldwide? You can invest in the US, but in funds that diversify worldwide or across industries. Generally it is a good idea to diversify. I am 28. Should I be a conservative investor or take some risks? Depends on how bad of a shape will you be if you lose all your principle. What online brokerage service is the best? I have heard a lot about Scotttrade but want to be sure before I start. It seems to be the least expensive and most userfriendly to me. \"Best\" is a problematic term. Scottrade is OK, ETrade is OK, you can try Sharebuilder, Ameritrade, there are several \"discount\" online brokers and plenty of online reviews and comparisons amongst them. What is a margin account and how would it affect my investing? From what I understand it comes into play when an investor borrows money from the broker. Do I need to use it at all as I wont be investing on a big scale yet. You understand right. There are rules to use margin accounts, and with the amount you have Id advise against them even if you get approved. Read through the brokers FAQs on their requirement. Should I keep adding money on a monthly basis to my brokerage account to give me more money to invest or keep it at a certain amount for an extended period of time? Sharebuilder has a mechanism to purchase monthly at discounted prices. But be careful, they give you discounted prices to buy, but not to sell. You may end up with a lot of positions, and the discounts youve gotten to buy will cause you spend much more on selling. Generally, averaging investing monthly is a good way to save and mitigate some risks, but the risks are still there. This is good only for long term savings. How should my breakdown my investments in terms of bonds vs stocks? Depends on your vulnerability and risk thresholds."

Although Delaware has the best advertising campaign, so people know about it, the reality is that there are over 50 statesjurisdictions in the United States with their own competitive incorporation laws to attract investment as well as their own legislative bodies that change those laws, so you just have to read the laws to find a state that is favorable for you. What I mean is that whatever Delaware does to get in the news about its easy business laws, has been mimicked and done even better by other states by this point in time. And regarding Delawares Chancery Court, all other states in the union can also lean on Delaware case law, so this perk is not unique to Delaware. Wyoming is cheaper than Delaware for nominal presence in the United States, requires less information then Delaware, and is also tax free. A \"registered agent\" can get you set up and you can find one to help you with the address dilemma. This should only cost 99  200 over the state fees. An LLC does not need to have an address in the United States, but many registered agents will let you use their address, just ask. Many kinds of businesses still require a bank account for domestic and global trade. Many dont require any financial intermediary any more to receive payments. But if you do need this, then opening a bank account in the United States will be more difficult. Again, the registered agent or lawyer can get a Tax Identification Number for you from the IRS, and this will be necessary to open a US bank account. But it is more likely that you will need an employee or nominee director in the United States to go in person to a bank and open an account. This person needs to be mentioned in the Operating Agreement or other official form on the incorporation documents. They will simply walk into a bank with your articles of incorporation and operating agreement showing that they are authorized to act on behalf of the entity and open a bank account. They then resign, and this is a private document between the LLC and the employee. But you will be able to receive and accept payments and access the global financial system now.

If this loan is really purely personal and not related to your business activities, you may create a paper trail that can later be used in this way.

What we do to minimize food waste On Sunday when my wife and I go grocery shopping, we figure out what meals we are going to have for dinner that week, and we only buy what we need for those meals. We also try to decide in advance what nights we are going out for dinner. For example, we know we have to take the inlaws out for dinner on Wednesday, so we dont buy a dinner for that night. As part of our weekly planning, we figure out the lunches we will take to work based on our dinners. For example, if we plan to make a big pot of pasta for dinner one night, we know well have leftovers for lunch, so we wont buy a lunch for the following day. Basically, we try to match our food purchasing to our food consumption. During the week, we generally try to cook the dinner that uses the most perishable items first. If we buy seafood, that will be Monday nights dinner. The frozen pizza can wait until the end of the week. My wife an I both have to deal with the occasional unexpected late night at work, which can mess up our cooking plans. As a result, it is not uncommon for us to be too tired to cook, so we skip a dinner. It is less wasteful to do that with something frozenpreserved. Also, we try to consider cooking time vs our work schedule. We dont pick a complex dinner for a night that we know in advance will be a long work day."

For example, you could open a Roth IRA account with Vanguard. You could then invest the 3000 by purchasing shares of VOO, which tracks the SP 500 index and has a very low expense ratio 0.04 as of last time I checked. Fidelity has a similar option, or Schwab, or whatever brokerage firm you prefer. IRAs are basically just normal investment accounts, except they dont owe taxes until you withdraw them and Roth dont even owe them then, though you paid taxes on the funds you deposit. They have some limitations regarding options trading and such, but if youre a novice investor just looking to do basic investments, youll not notice. Then, your IRA would go up or down in value as the market went up or down in value. You do have some restrictions on when you can withdraw the funds Roth IRA has fewer than a normal IRA, as you can withdraw the capital the amount you deposited without penalty, but the profits cannot be withdrawn until youre retirement age I wont put an actual year, as I suspect that actual year will change by the time youre that old but think 60s. The reason not to invest in an IRA is if you plan on using the money in the near future  even as an \"emergency fund\". You should have some money that is not invested aggressively, that is in something very safe and very accessible, for your emergency fund and if you plan to buy a house or whatever with the funds, dont start an IRA. But if this is truly money you want to save for retirement, thats the best place to start. Note, this is not investment advice, and you should do your own homework prior to making any investment.

    "content": "Not all futures contracts are deliverable. Some futures are specified as cash settlement only. In the case of deliverable contracts, part of the specification of a futures contract will be the delivery locations. As per my answer to your previous question, please see the CME Rulebook for details of delivery points for the deliverable futures contracts traded on CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX. Assuming your agreement with your broker allows you to exercise your right to take delivery, your broker will facilitate your delivery. You will be required to pay the contracted amount your buy price x contract size x number of lots, as well as a delivery fee, insurance, and warehousing fees. In addition, your broker may charge you a fee for facilitating the delivery. You will be required to continue to pay insurance and warehousing fees so long as your holding of the underlying commodity is held in the exchanges designated warehouse. If you wish to take delivery yourself by having the commodity removed from the warehouse and delivered to you personally, then you will need to arrange this delivery yourself. Warehousedelivery points obviously vary according the contract being exercised. See the CME Rulebook for available delivery points. Some exchanges are more accommodating than others. The practicality of taking delivery very much depends on your personal circumstances. An investment bank taking delivery of treasury bonds would be more practical than an individual investor taking delivery of treasury bonds. This is because the individual investor would be required to deliver the bonds to a brokerage in order to sell them. In the case of nonfinancial futures deliveries, it is hard to imagine any circumstance where an individual taking delivery would be practical."

    "content": "Yes, youve got it right. The change in price is less meaningful as the instrument is further from the price of the underlying. As the delta moves less, the gamma is much less. Gamma is to delta as acceleration is to speed. Speed is movement relative to X, and acceleration is rate of change in speed. Delta is movement relative to S, and gamma is the rate of change in delta. Delta changes quickly when it is around the money, which is another way of saying gamma is higher. Delta is the change of the option price relative to the change in stock price. If the strike price is near the market price, then the odds of being in or out of the money could appear to be changing very quickly  even going back and forth repeatedly. Gamma is the rate of change of the delta, so these sudden lurches in pricing are by definition the gamma. This is to some extent a little mundane and even obvious. But its a useful heuristic for analyzing prices and movement, as well as for focusing analyst attention on different pricing aspects. Youve got it right.

    "content": "The answer to your question is very simple The preauth and the shipment of the goods have no connection within the credit card system. It is possible to process a payment that does not cancel a preauthorization. This is needed for the case where you place two orders and the one you placed second ships first. A preauth can remain active for some time unless it is captured or cancelled. So in your case a preauth was placed and remained active. That you were shipped and billed for some goods had no effect on the preauth because one side or the other failed to attach them."

If not for a fear of losing it in a robbery and inability to earn interest, Id shove it under a mattress. So why would I want to bank with an intermediary, who admittently doesnt understand how the process works? How is that \"looking out for my interests\"? And how is your security better than other institutions that offer 128bit encryption and multiple security questions to test a customers identity? Id like to add that not charging overdraft fees and providing lines of credit to help customers out in the event they spend more than they have is nice in concept, but what happens when those same customers do not make deposits to cover their shortfalls? When it comes to money, people will take advantage of any opportunities they have to circumvent the system. Especially if funds are tight."

    "content": "The stock market, as a whole, is extremely volatile. During any 3 year period, the market could go up or down. However, and this is the important point,the market as a whole has historically been a good long term investment. If you need the money in 5 years, then you want to put it in something less volatile so theres less chance of losing it. If you need the money in 50 years, put it in the market the massive growth over those 50 years will more than make up for any short term drops, and you will probably come out ahead. Once you get closer to retirement age, you want to take the money out of stocks and put it in something safer essentially locking in your profit, and protecting yourself from the possibility of further loss. Something else to consider everyone lost money in 2008. There were no safe investments well, ok, there were a few... but not enough to talk about. Given that, why would you choose another investment over stocks? Taking a 50 loss after decades of 10 annual returns is still better than a 50 loss after decades of 5 growth in fact, after 20 years of growth, its still 250 better  and that ratio will only improve the longer you leave it in."

    "topic": "Evidence for Technical Analysis [duplicate]",
    "content": "To answer your original question There is proof out there. Here is a paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that might be worth a read. It has a lot of references to other publications that might help answer your questions about TA. You can probably read the whole article then research some of the other ones listed there to come up with a conclusion. Below are some excerpts Abstract This article introduces the subject of technical analysis in the foreign exchange market, with emphasis on its importance for questions of market efficiency. Technicians view their craft, the study of price patterns, as exploiting traders psychological regularities. The literature on technical analysis has established that simple technical trading rules on dollar exchange rates provided 15 years of positive, riskadjusted returns during the 1970s and 80s before those returns were extinguished. More recently, more complex and less studied rules have produced more modest returns for a similar length of time. Conventional explanations that rely on risk adjustment andor central bank intervention do not plausibly justify the observed excess returns from following simple technical trading rules. Psychological biases, however, could contribute to the profitability of these rules. We view the observed pattern of excess returns to technical trading rules as being consistent with an adaptive markets view of the world. and The widespread use of technical analysis in foreign exchange and other markets is puzzling because it implies that either traders are irrationally making decisions on useless information or that past prices contain useful information for trading. The latter possibility would contradict the efficient markets hypothesis, which holds that no trading strategy should be able to generate unusual profits on publicly available informationsuch as past pricesexcept by bearing unusual risk. And the observed level of riskadjusted profitability measures market inefficiency. Therefore much research effort has been directed toward determining whether technical analysis is indeed profitable or not. One of the earliest studies, by Fama and Blume 1966, found no evidence that a particular class of TTRs could earn abnormal profits in the stock market. However, more recent research by Brock, Lakonishok and LeBaron 1992 and Sullivan, Timmermann an d White 1999 has provided contrary evidence. And many studies of the foreign exchange market have found evidence that TTRs can generate persistent profits Poole 6 1967, Dooley and Shafer 1984, Sweeney 1986, Levich and Thomas 1993, Neely, Weller and Dittmar 1997, Genay 1999, Lee, Gleason and Mathur 2001 and Martin 2001."

If anything, your company might have to pay Oregon taxes on revenue you generate you are their agent or employee in Oregon. Does the answer change depending on whether the income is reported at 1099 or W2? This shouldnt matter legally. Its possible that it would be easier to see that the work was done in Oregon in one or the other. I.e. it doesnt make any legal difference but may make a practical difference. All this assumes that you are purely an employee or contractor and not an owner. If you are an owner, you have to pay taxes on any income from your Massachusetts business.

Think \"emerging markets\". Even funds like Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF VWO, mutual fund, VEIEX or Fidelity Advisor Emerging Markets Income Trust FAEMX seem to have yields which only push 11 or so. But inflation is about nil, so if youre used to normal 2 inflation or so, these yields are like 13 or so. And theres no tax on that last 2! Yay. Remember that these investments are very risky. They go up lots because they can go down lots too. Dont put any money in there unless you can afford to have it go missing, because sooner or later youre likely to lose something half your money, and it might not come back for a decade or ever. Investments like these should only be a small part of your overall portfolio. So, that said... Sites which make investing in these risky markets easy? There are a good number, but you should probably just go with vanguard.com. Their funds have low fees which wont erode your returns. You can actually get lower expense ratios by using their brokerage account to trade the ETF versions of their funds commissionfree, though youll have to worry more about the actual number of shares you want to buy, instead of just plopping in and out dollar amounts. You can also trade Vanguard ETFs and other ETFs at almost any brokerage, just like stocks, and most brokerages will also offer you access to a variety of mutual funds as well though often for a hefty fee of 2050, which you should avoid. Or you can sign up for another fund providers account, but remember that the fund fees add up quickly. And the better plan?

Expecting total cost to be 160K, and total rent 2500. I missed ratio a by a bit, but 1250 to go toward a 120K mortgage works out fine. 550 profitmo on the 25 down 40K.

Once you are a family, you should  and, in most cases Ive seen, will  think of things differently than you do now. Right now, your post above is written from a selfish perspective. Not to be insulting, and not implying selfish is a bad thing  I dont mean it negatively. But it is how youre defining this problem from a selfinterested, selfish point of view. \"Fair\" and \"unfair\" only have meaning from this point of view something can only be unfair to you if you come from a selfcentered viewpoint. Try to think of this from a familycentric viewpoint, and from your significant others point of view. Youre absolutely right to want both of you to be independent financially as far as is possible but think about what that means from all three points of view your familys, yours, and hers? Exactly what it means will depend on the two of you separately and together, but I would encourage you to start with a few basics that make it likely youll find a common ground First of all, ensure your significant other has a retirement account of her own that is funded as well as yours is. This will both make life easier if you split up, and give her a safety net if something happens to you than if you have all of the retirement savings. I dont know how your country manages pensions or retirement accounts, but figure out how to get her into something that is as close to equal to yours as possible. Make sure both of you have similar quality credit histories. You should both have credit cards in your own names or be true joint owners of the accounts, not just authorized users, where that is possible, and both be on the mortgageetc. when possible. This is a common issue for women whose spouse dies young and who have no credit history. Thanks KateGregory for reminding me on this one Beyond that, work out how much your budget allows for in spending money for the two of you, and split that equally. This spending money i.e., \"fun money\" or money you can do whatever you like with is what is fundamentally important in terms of financial independence if you control most of the extra money, then youre the one who ultimately has control over much vacations, eating out, etc. and things will be strained. This money should be equal  whether it is literally apportioned directly each of you has 200 a month in an account or simply budgeted for with a common account is up to you, whatever works best for your personal habits separate accounts works well for many here to keep things honest. When that money is accounted for, whatever it is, split the rest of the bills up so that she pays some of them from her income. If she wants to be independent, some of that is being in the habit of paying bills on time. One of you paying all of the bills is not optimal since it means the other will not build good habits. For example, my wife pays the warehouse club credit card and the cell phone bill, while I pay the gaselectric utilities. Whatever doesnt go to spending money and doesnt go to the bills shes personally responsible for or youre responsible for from your paycheck should go to a joint account. That joint account should pay the larger bills  mortgagerent, in particular  and common household expenses, and both of you should have visibility on it. For example, our mortgage, daycare costs, major credit card which includes most of our groceries and other household expenses come from that joint account. This kind of system, where you each have equal money to spend and each have some household responsibilities, seems the most reasonable to me it incurs the least friction over money, assuming everyone sticks to their budgeted amounts, and prevents one party from being able to hold power over another. Its a system that seems likely to be best for the family as a unit. Its not \"fair\" from a selfcentered point of view, but is quite fair from a familycentered point of view, and that is the right point of view when you are a family, in my opinion. Ill emphasize here also that it is important that no one party hold the power, and this is set up to avoid that, but its also important that you not use your earning power as a major arguing point in this system. Youre not \"funding her lifestyle\" or anything like that youre supporting your family, just as she is. If she were earning more than you, would you cut your hours and stay at home? Trick question, as it happens regardless of your answer to that question, youre still at the same point both of you are doing the thing youre best suited for or, the thing you prefer. Youre both supporting the family, just in different ways, and suggesting that your contribution is more valuable than hers is a great way to head down the road to divorce its also just plain incorrect. My wife and I are in almost the identical situation  2 kids, she works part time in the biological sciences while spending plenty of time with the kids, Im a programmer outearning her significantly  and I can tell you that Id more than happily switch roles if she were the bread earner, and would feel just as satisfied if not more doing so. And, I can imagine myself in that position, so I can also imagine how Id feel in that position as far as how I value my contribution."

    "topic": "What effect would sovereign default of a European country have on personal debt or a mortgage?",
    "content": "This is a hard question to answer. Government debt and mortgages are loosely related. Banks typically use yields on government bonds to determine mortgage interest rates. The banks must be able to get higher rates from the mortgage otherwise they would buy government bonds. Your question mentions default so Im assuming a country has reneged on its promise to pay either the principal or interest on government bonds. The main thing to consider is \"Who does not get their money?\". In other words, who does the government decide not to pay. This is the important part. The government will have some money so they could pay some bond holders. They must decide who to shaft. For example, lets look at who holds Greek government debt. Around 70 of Greek government debt is held outside Greece. See table below. The Greek government could decide to default only on the debt to foreign holders. In that case the banks in France and Switzerland would take the loss on their bonds. This could cause severe problems in France and Switzerland depending on the percentage of Greek bonds that make up the banks assets. Greek banks would still face losses, however, since the price of their Greek bond holdings would drop sharply when the government defaults. Interestingly, the losses for the Greek banks may be smaller than the losses faced by the French and Swiss banks. This is usually the favored option chosen by government since the French and Swiss dont vote in Greece. Yields on Greek government bonds would rise dramatically. If your Greek mortgage is an adjustable rate mortgage then you could see some big adjustments upward. If you live in France or Switzerland then the bank that owns your mortgage may go under if Greece defaults. During liquidation the bank will sell their assets which includes mortgages and you will probably not notice any difference in your mortgage. As I stated earlier this is a hard question to answer since the two financial instruments involved bonds and mortgages are similar but may or may not be related."

    "topic": "Can my spouse be the primary signer on my cars loan?",
    "content": "Go to your local bank or credit union before talking to a dealership. Ask them if putting both names on the loan makes a difference regarding rates and maximum loan you qualify for. Ask them to run the loan application both ways. Having both names on the loan helps build the credit of the spouse that has a lower score. You may find that both incomes are needed for a car loan if the couple has a mortgage or other joint obligations. The lender will treat the entire mortgage payment or rent payment as a liability against the person applying for the loan, they wont split the housing payment in half if only one name will be on the car loan. Therefore sometimes the 2nd persons income is needed even if their credit is not as good. That additional income without a significant increase in liabilities can make a huge difference regarding the loan they can qualify for. Once the car is in your possession, it doesnt matter who drives it. In general the insurance company will put both spouses as authorized drivers. Note it is almost always better to ask your bank or credit union about a car loan before going to the dealership. That gives you a solid data point regarding a loan, and removes a major complexity to the negotiations at the dealership."

Some small companies or closely held companies may not want to list on stock exchange and hence are not traded. This does not mean they cant be bought and sold, they can be outside of the market, however the deals are complex and every deal has to be worked out. During the course of time a stock that is traded on a stock exchange, would either fail to meet the criteria or voluntarily choose not to be traded and follow the delisting process [either by stock exchange or by company].

The first paragraph of the IRS Instructions for Schedule C is as follows Use Schedule C Form 1040 to report income or loss from a business you operated or a profession you practiced as a sole proprietor. An activity qualifies as a business if your primary purpose for engaging in the activity is for income or profit and you are involved in the activity with continuity and regularity. For example, a sporadic activity or a hobby does not qualify as a business. To report income from a nonbusiness activity, see the instructions for Form 1040, line 21, or Form 1040NR, line 21. What the poster is doing is acting as a nominee or agent for his members. For instance, if I give you 3.00 and ask you to go into Starbucks and buy me a pumpkinspice latte, you do not have income or receipts of 3.00, and you are not engaged in a business. The amounts that the posters members are forwarding him are like this. Money that the poster receives for his trouble should be reported as nonbusiness income on Line 21 of Form 1040, in accordance with the instructions quoted above and the instructions for Form 1040. Finally, it should be noted that the poster cannot take deductions or losses relating to this activity. So he cant deduct any expenses of organizing the group buy on his tax return. Of course, this would not be the case if the group buy really is the posters business and not just a \"hobby.\" Of course, it goes without saying that the poster should document all of this activity with receipts, contemporaneous emails and if available, contracts  as well as anything else that could possibly be relevant to proving the nature of this activity in the event of an audit."

Debit cards do not usually provide this coverage. So, if you use a credit card, the car company knows it will be able to recover the cost of any damage to the car. Of course, this doesnt explain some of the odd debit card policies out there. For example, Alamo will not let you use a debit card unless you provide proof of round trip travel like a plane or cruise ticket. But you can use a credit card without having a travel ticket.

For example, if you make two trades in one day with your broker  one to buy a security for 100 and one to sell it for 110  rather then you sending your broker 100 and them sending you 110, the transactions are \"netted\"  meaning they will send you the \"net\" amount of 10 110 inflow  100 outflow. In a more general sense \"netting of instructions\" it would mean to combine all instructions and only apply the \"net\" effect  e.g. one step forward, two steps back would combine to a \"net\" one step back. Most likely it will apply to the exchange of money, but it could be applied more broadly. Note that there doesnt have to be both inflows and outflows. You can also \"net\" multiple inflows or outflows into one transaction by just adding them all up, but typical business usage is to reduce the number of transactions by combining inflows and outflows."

    "content": "All of the answers given so far are correct, but rather narrow. When you buy a 30yearmortgage, you are buying the right to pay off the debt in as long as 30 years. What you pay depends on the interest rate and how long you actually take to pay it off and principal and points and so on. Just as you are buying that right, the mortgager is selling you that right, and they usually charge something for it, typically a higher rate. After all, they, and not you, will be exposed to interest risk for 30 years. However, if some bank has an aneurism and is willing to give you a 30year loan for the same price as or lower than any other bank is willing to go for a 15year loan, hey, free flexibility. Might as well take it. If you want to pay the loan off in 15 year, or 10 or 20, you can go ahead and do so."

Your number one issue is that you have a thirty year mortgage. The interest you pay on it is monstrous. For the 30 year term, you pay around 500K in interest. A 15year mortgage is 300K cheaper only 200K in interest will be paid. The monthly payment would be 1250 more. How much money and years on a mortgage can I save? When is the best time to pay?

Once the check is cashed, this page will also contain images of the front and back of the cashed check, so you can prove that the recipient really did cash it. You can see from this info that the check is being funded from a different account number than your own, which is good for security purposes since per Knuth, 2008 giving someone else your bank routing number and account number as found on your personal checks basically provides them with all they need to fraudulently, of course clean out your account."

Quite a few believe there could be issues faced i.e. it may not make the 12, or there will be additional obligations, i.e. employees may demand more layoff compensation, etc. or the distribution may take few years due to regulatory and legal hurdles. The only problem is the stock exchange states if the company has no core business, the stock will be suspended soon hopefully they can release the 12 per share first. What will happen if I hold shares in the company, the stock gets suspended, and its sitting on 12 per share? Can it still distribute it out?

Yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period. You can opt to use the Yahoo Query Language YQL, which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the CSV files. Although the rate limit is higher for YQL, you may still run into it. An API that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds. Although the reliability varies throughout the site, Yahoo Finance isnt considered the most reliable of sources. You cant beat free, of course, but at least for research purposes, the Center for Research in Security Prices CRSP at UChicago and Wharton is considered the gold standard. On the commercial side, data providers like eSignal, Bloomberg, Reuters also enjoy widespread popularity. Although both the output from YQL and Yahoos current CSV output are fairly standard, they wont necessarily remain that way. A commercial API is basically a contract with the data provider that they wont change the format without significant prior notice, but its reasonable to assume that if Yahoo wanted to, they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications. A change in Yahoos format would likely break many sites or applications too, but their terms of use do state that Yahoo \"may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Yahoo! Finance Modules at any time, including the availability of any Yahoo! Finance Modules. Yahoo! may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Yahoo! Finance Modules or the Yahoo! Web site without notice or liability.\" If youre designing a commercial application, a paid provider will probably provide technical support for their API. According to Yahoo Finances license terms, you cant use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their \"badges\" whatever those are. See here. In this post, a Yahoo employee states The Finance TOS is fairly specific. Redistribution of data is only allowed if you are using the badges the team has created. Otherwise, you can use YQL or whatever method to obtain data for personal use. The license itself states that you may not sell, lease, or sublicense the Yahoo! Finance Modules or access thereto or derive income from the use or provision of the Yahoo! Finance Modules, whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or otherwise, without Yahoo!s prior, express, written permission In short, for personal use, Yahoo Finance is more than adequate. For research or commercial purposes, a data provider is a better option. Furthermore, many commercial applications require more data than Yahoo provides, e.g. tickbytick data for equities, derivatives, futures, data on mergers, etc., which a paid data source will likely provide. Yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements I cant find any examples at the moment, but I had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10Ks that he had come across. Ive always assumed this is because the data were manually entered, although I would assume EDGAR has some method for automatic retrieval.

Absolutely nothing you do should involve paying any attention to your investments more than once a year if that. First off, you can only deposit money in an IRA of whatever kind if you have taxable income. If you dont, you can still invest, just without the tax benefits of a Roth. My suggestion would be to open an account with a discount brokerage Schwab, Fidelity, eTrade, etc. The advantage of a brokerage IRA is that you can invest in whatever you want within the account. Then, either buy an SP 500 or total market index fund within the account, or buy an indexbased ETF like a mutual fund, but trades like a stock. The latter might be better, since many mutual funds have minimum limits, which ETFs do not. Set the account up to reinvest the dividends automaticallySP 500 yields will far outstrip current savings account yieldsand sit back and do nothing for the next 40 or 50 years.

The expense ratio charged by the mutual fund is built into the NAV per share of the fund, and you do not see the charge explicitly mentioned as a deduction on your 401k statement or in the statement received from the mutual fund in a non401k situation. The expense ratio is listed in the funds prospectus, and should also have been made available to you in the literature about the new 401k plan that your employer is setting up. Mutual fund fees for things like having a small balance, or for that matter, sales charges if any of the funds in the 401k are load funds, God forbid are different. Some load mutual funds waive the sales charge load for 401k participants, while some may not. Actually, it all depends on how hard the employer negotiates with the 401k administration company who handles all the paperwork and the mutual fund company with which the 401k administration company negotiates. In the 1980s, Fidelity Magellan 3 sales load was a hot fund, but my employer managed to get it as an option in our plan with no sales load it helped that my employer was large and could twist arms more easily than a momandpop outfit or Solo 401k plan could. A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, my first ever IRA contribution of 2000 into a noload mutual fund resulted in a 25 annual maintenance fee, but the law allowed the payment of this fee separately from the 2000 if the IRA owner wished to do so. If not, the 25 would reduce the IRA balance and no, this did not count as a premature distribution from the IRA. Plan expenses are what the 401k administration company charges the employer for running the plan and these expenses are not necessarily peanuts a 401k plan is not something that needs just a spreadsheet  there is lots of other paperwork that the employee never gets to see. In some cases, the employer pays the entire expense as a cost of doing business in other cases, part is paid by the employer and the rest is passed on to the employees. As far as I know, there is no mechanism for the employee to pay these expenses outside the 401k plan that is, these expenses are visibly deducted from the 401k plan balance. Finally, with regard to the question asked how are plan fees divided among the investment options? I dont believe that anyone other than the 401k plan administrator or the employer can answer this. Even if the employer simply adopts one of the prepackaged plans offered by a big 401k administrator many brokerages and mutual fund companies offer these, the exact numbers depend on which prepackaged plan has been chosen. I do think the answers the OP has received are rubbish."

Suppose some colossal company offered to loan you a billion dollars at 0  interest. Would you take it? Or would you say \"No thanks, I dont want that much debt.\" You would be crazy not to accept. You could put that money in the safest investments available and still pocket millions while making the minimum payments back to them. Your choice here is essentially the same, but unfortunately, on much smaller scale. That said, math doesnt always trump other factors. You need to factor in your peace of mind, future purchases, the need for future borrowing, your short term income and job security, and whether you think you can reliably make payments on this loan without messing up and triggering fees that wipe out the mathematical advantage of slow paying the loan. You are fortunate because you really cant make a wrong choice here. Paying off debt is never a bad choice IMO. However, it may not always be the best choice."

Since that money is out of sight, I do not think much about it and I do not think that I could spend it. I know it is a cheap trick, but it works pretty well for me."

So, indicator can be used for long term, as well as short term. I mean if it is a range market, using this or any other indicator will not help much, so it you should consider market direction first. If it can be used to longterm trade, is there something I need to change from the parameters used? like, only using SMMA5,8,13? The parameters are there to change them. Of course you can change them based on your trading style. Considering my statement above does not mean that trading is very easy. I never use indicators alone to make trading decisions.

    "content": "Typically investing in only two securities is not a good idea when trying to spread risk. Even though you are in the VTI which is spread out over a large amount of securites it should in theory reduce portfolio beta to zero, or in this case as close to it as possible. The VTI however has a beta of 1.03 as of close today in New York. This means that the VTI moves roughly in exact tandem as \"the market\" usually benched against the SP 500, so this means that the VTI is slightly more volatile than that index. In theory beta can be 0, this would be akin to investing in Tbills which are assumed to be the risk free rate. So in theory it is possible to reduce the risk in your portfolio and apply a more capital protective model. I hope this helps you a bit."

    "content": "littleadvs answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now, but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan. In broad terms, the balances of your accounts and your future benefit wont change. Its only the source of these benefits thats changing. The Bloomberg article describes the changes this way The state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of Sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the staterun social security system... The state will assume control of 51.5 percent of pensionfund assets, including bonds guaranteed by the government and other nonstock assets After the change, Polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the staterun pension system. The balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits shouldnt change, but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements. The effect this change will have on future benefits isnt clear, because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt, not solve it. The government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds, less money went into the governments fund, which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities. The governments recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt, but in exchange, the government is increasing its future pension liabilities. Years down the road, the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities theyre taking on today. In other words, they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road, and its difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time."

    "topic": "Taxes on foreign and local dividends held in a TFSA",
    "content": "As far as I read in many articles, all earnings capital gains and dividends from Canadian stocks will be always taxfree. Right? Theres no withholding tax, ie. a 100 dividend means you get 100. Theres no withholding for capital gains in shares for anybody. You will still have to pay taxes on the amounts, but thats only due at tax time and it could be very minor or even a refund for eligible Canadian dividends. Thats because the company has already paid tax on those dividends. In contrast, holding U.S. or any foreign stock that yields dividends in a TFSA will pay 15 withholding tax and it is not recoverable. Correct, but the 15 is a special rate for regular shares and you need to fill out a W8BEN. Your broker will probably make sure you have every few years. But if you hold the same stock in a nonregistered account, this 15 withholding tax can be used as a foreign tax credit? Is this true or not or what are the considerations? Thats true but reduces your Canadian tax payable, its not refundable, so you have to have some tax to subtract it from. Another consideration is foreign dividends are included 100 in income no mater what the character is. That means you pay tax at your highest rate always if not held in a tax sheltered account. Canadian dividends that are in a nonregistered account will pay taxes, I presume and I dont know how much, but the amount can be used also as a tax credit or are unrecoverable? What happens in order to take into account taxes paid by the company is, I read also that if you dont want to pay withholding taxes from foreign  dividends you can hold your stock in a RRSP or RRIF? You dont have any withholding taxes from US entities to what they consider Canadian retirement accounts. So TFSAs and RESPs arent covered. Note that it has to be a US fund like SPY or VTI that trades in the US, and the account has to be RRSPRRIF. You cant buy a Canadian listed ETF that holds US stocks and get the same treatment. This is also only for the US, not foreign like Europe or Asia. Also something like VT total world in the US will have withholding taxes from foreign Europe  Asia mostly before the money gets to the US. You cant get that back. Just an honourable mention for the UK, theres no withholding taxes for anybody, and I hear its on sale. But at some point, if I withdraw the money, who do I need to pay taxes,  U.S. or Canada?

    "topic": "Whats the least risky investment for people in Europe?",
    "content": "First of all, congratulations on saving some money. So many people these days do not even get that far. As far as investments, what is best for you depends heavily on your Here is a quick summary of types of assets that are likely available to you, and my thoughts on why they may or may not be a good fit for your situation. Cash Equivalents Cash Equivalents are highly liquid, meaning you can get cash for them on fairly short notice. In particular, Money Markets and Certificates of Deposit CDs are also considered very safe when issued by a bank, as they are often insured against loss by the government up to a certain amount this varies quite a lot by country within Europe, see the Wikipedia article here for additional detail. Please note that in the case of a CD, you are usually unable to get access to your money for the length of the investment period, which is usually a short period of time such as 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year. This is a good choice if you may need your money back on short notice, and your main goal is to preserve your principal. However, the returns tend to be very low and often do not keep pace with inflation, meaning that over several years, you may lose \"real\" purchasing power, even if you dont lose nominal value in your account. Special Note on Cash Equivalents If the money you want to invest is also your Emergency Fund, or you do not have an Emergency Fund, I would highly recommend Cash Equivalents. They will provide the highest level of Liquidity along with a short Time Horizon so that you can get your money as needed in the case of unforeseen expenses such as if your car breaks down. Debt Debt investments include government and corporate bonds. They are still considered relatively safe, as the issuer would need to default usually this means they are in bankruptcy in order for you not to be paid back. For example, German bonds have been considered safer than Greek bonds recently based on the underlying strength of the government. Unlike Cash Equivalents, these are not guaranteed against loss, which means that if the issuer defaults, you could lose up to 100 of your investment. Bonds have several new features you will need to consider. One is interest rate risk. One reason bonds perform better than cash equivalents is that you are taking on the risk that if interest rates rise, the fixed payments the bond promises will be worth less, and the face value of your bond will fall. While most bonds are still very Liquid, this means that if you need to sell the bond before it matures, you could lose money. As mentioned earlier, some bonds are riskier than others. Given that you are looking for a lowrisk investment, you would want to select a bond that is considered \"invesment grade\" rather than a riskier \"junk\" bond. Debt investments are a good choice if you can afford to do without this money for a few years, and you want to balance safety with somewhat better returns than Cash Equivalents. Again though, I would not recommend investing in Debt until you have also built up a separate Emergency Fund. If you do choose to invest in bonds, I recommend that you diversify your risks by investing in a bond fund, rather than in just one companys or governments debt. This will reduce the likelihood that you will experience a catastrophic loss. Ownership Ownership assets includes stocks and other assets such as real estate and precious metals such as gold. While these investments can have high returns, in your situation I would strongly recommend that you not invest in these types of investments, for the following reasons For these reasons, debt is considered a safer investment than equity for any particular company, government, or the market as a whole. Ownership assets are a good choice for people who have a high Risk Tolerance, long Time Horizon, low Liquidity needs, and will not be bothered by larger potential changes in the value of the investment at any given time. Special Note on Gold I would consider Gold a very risky investment and not a good fit for you at the moment based on what youve shared in your question. Gold is considered \"safe\" in the sense that people believe that if the economy goes into recession, depression, or collapses entirely, gold will continue to be valuable. In a postapocalyptic world where paper money became worthless, it is still a good bet that gold will always be considered valuable within human society as a store of value. That being said, the price of gold fluctuates almost entirely based on how bad people think things are going to get. Think about the difference between gold and a company like CocaCola. Would you like to own 100 of CocaCola? Of course, because you know there is a very good chance that people will continue to spend money all over the world on their products. On the other hand, gold itself produces no products, no sales, no profits, and no cash flow. As such, if you buy gold, you are really making a speculative bet that gold will be in higher demand tomorrow than it is today. You are buying an asset the gold rather than part of a companys equity or debt that is designed to throw off payments to its investors in the form of bond payments or dividends. So, if people decide next year that things are improving, it is possible that gold could lose value, given that gold prices are at historically high levels. Gold could be a good choice for someone who has a large, welldiversified investment portfolio, and who is looking for a hedge to protect against inflation and other risks that they have taken on via their other investments. I hope that is helpful  best of luck in your choices. Let us know what you decide!"

The interest youre paying, in addition to your insurance isnt justifiable for building credit. I would recommend paying the car off and then perhaps applying for a secure credit card if you are worried about being rejected. Of course, since you have very little credit, applying for an unsecured card and getting rejected wont hurt you in the long run. If you are rejected, you can always go for a secured credit card the second time. As I mentioned in my comments, its better to show 6 months of ontime payments than to have no payment history at all.

Its less likely to be viable if theres one main breadwinner in the house. In our house, this is me. If we separated the finances like this, it would amount to giving my wife an allowance.

For example, fractional reserve requirements are 10 against checking accounts, but 0 against savings accounts. The theory is that savings accounts are sticky, while checking accounts are hot money. So the Fed wants to stop banks from creating accounts that are regulated as savings accounts but have the features of checking accounts. In the past, this was done by forbidding banks to pay interest on checking accounts. They eliminated that rule back in the inflation years, and instead imposed the rule that to qualify as a savings accounts for regulatory purposes, banks must discourage you from using them as transactional accounts. For example, by limiting the number of withdrawals per month that can be made from a savings account. If the Fed gave up on trying to enforce a distinction, I suspect there would soon no longer be a distinction."

He can invest that money in cocacolaunderwear, which might return Or he can invest in \"genius moves\" that will make headlines like buying huge stakes in Goldman Sachs, which might return And he makes plays for the long haul based on the expected value of the investments. So if he splits it 5050... 5 million 5 million, then his expected value is 822,250 By diversifying, he does reduce the expected value of the portfolio... He is not giving 10 M the chance to turn into 1.5 million or 2 million for him!. The expected value of that shockandawe portfolio with all 10 million invested in it is 1.2M. By taking less risk... for less reward... his expected return is lower. But his risk is lower too. Scale this example back up into the 100 million or billion range that Buffett invests in and that extra margin makes the difference.

If you hold a stock at the beginning of this day, you will receive the dividend. So you could buy a stock right at the end of the day on the day before the exdividend date, and sell it the next day on the exdividend date, and you would get your dividend. See this page from the SEC for more information. The problem with this strategy, however, is that the value of the stock typically drops by the same amount as the dividend on that day. If you take a look at the historical price of the stock you are interested in, youll see this. Of course, it makes sense why a seller knows that selling before the date results in a loss of the dividend, so they want a higher price to compensate. Likewise, a buyer on or after the date knows that the dividend is already gone, so they want to pay a lower price."

In the index fund case it will additionally be on the capital gains that have been realized within the fund, which are very few for an index fund. Not a ton in either case. The more important tax consideration is between purchase and sale, which is the same in either case. Id say stick it wherever the lowest fees are."

    "topic": "Starting a side business slowly",
    "content": "This is a great question! Ive been an entrepreneur and small business owner for 20 years and have started small businesses in 3 states that grew into nice income streams for me. Ive lived off these businesses for 20 years, so I know it can be done! First let me start by saying that the rules, regulations, requirements and laws for operating a business small or large legally, for the most part, are local laws and regulations. Depending on what your business does, you may have some federal rules to follow, but for the most part, it will be your locality state, county, city that determines what youll have to do to comply and be \"legal\". Also, though it might be better in some cases to incorporate and even required in some circumstances, you dont always have to. There are many small businesses think landscapers, housekeepers, babysitters, etc. that get income from their \"business operations\" and do so as \"individuals\". Of course, everyone has to pay taxes  so as long as you property record your income and expenses and properly file your tax returns every year, you are \"income tax legal\". I wont try to answer the income tax question here, though, as that can be a big question. Also, though you certainly can start a business on your own without hiring lawyers or other professionals more on that below, when it comes to taxes, I definitely recommend you indeed plan to hire a tax professional even if its something like HR Block or Jackson Hewitt, etc. In some cities, there might even be \"free\" tax preparation services by certain organizations that want to help the community and these are often available even to small businesses. In general, income taxes can be complicated and the rules are always changing. Ive found that most small business owners that try to file their own taxes generally end up paying a lot more taxes than theyre required to, in essence, they are overpaying! Running a business and making a profit can be hard enough, so on to of that, you dont need to be paying more than you are required to! Also, I am going to assume that since it sounds like it would be a business of one you, that you wont have a Payroll. That is another area that can be complicated for sure. Ok, with those generics out of the way, let me tackle your questions related to starting and operating a business, since you have the \"idea for your business\" pretty figured out. Will you have to pay any substantial amount of money to attorneys or advisors or accountants or to register with the government? Not necessarily. Since the rules for operating a business legally vary by your operating location where you will be providing the service or performing your work, you can certainly research this on your own. It might take a little time, but its doable if you stick with it. Some resources The state of Florida where I live has an excellent page at httpwww.myflorida.comtaxonomybusinessstarting20a20business20in20florida You might not be in Florida, but almost every state will have something similar. What all do I need to do to remain on the right side of the law and the smart side of business? All of the answers above still apply to this question, but here are a few more items to consider You will want to keep good records of all expenses directly related to the business. If you license some content stock images for example, youll want to document receipts. These are easy usually as you know \"directly\". If you subscribe to the Apple Developer program which youll need to if you intend to sell Apps in the Apple App Stores, the subscription is an expense against your business income, etc. You will want to keep good records of indirect costs. These are not so easy to \"figure out\" and where a good accountant will help you when this becomes significant but these are important and a lot of business owners hurt themselves by not considering these. What do I mean? Well, you need an \"office\" in order to produce your work, right? You might need a computer, a phone, internet, electricity, heat, etc. all of which allow you to create a \"working environment\" that allows you to \"produce your product\". The IRS and state tax authorities all provide ways for you to quantify these and \"count them\" as legitimate business expenses. No, you cant use 100 of your electric bill since your office might be inside your home, and the entire bill is not \"just\" for your business but you are certainly entitled to some part of that bill to count as a business expense. Again, I dont want to get too far down the INCOME TAX rabbit hole, but you still need to keep track of what you spend! You must keep good record of ALL your income. This is especially important when you have money coming in from various sources a payroll, gifts from friends, business income from clients andor the App Stores, etc. Do not just assume that copies of your bank deposits tell the whole story. Bank statements might tell you the amount and date of a deposit, but you dont really know \"where\" that money came from unless you are tracking it! The good news is that the above record keeping can be quite easy with something like Quicken or QuickBooks or many many other such popular programs. You will want to ensure you have the needed licenses not necessarily required at all for a lot of small businesses, especially home based businesses. Depending on your business activity, you might want to consider business liability insurance. Again, this will depend on your clients andor other business entities youll be dealing with. Some might require you to have some insurance. Will be efforts even be considered a business initially until some amount of money actually starts coming in? This might be a legal  accountant question as to the very specific answer from the POV of the law and taxing authorities. However, consider that not all businesses make any money at all, for a long time, and they definitely \"are a business\". For instance, Twitter was losing money for a long time years and no one would argue they were not a business. Again, deferring to the attorneyscpas here for the legal answer, the practical answer is that youre performing \"some\" business activity when you start creating a product and working hard to make it happen! I would consider \"acting as\" a business regardless! What things do I need to do upfront and what things can I defer to later, especially in light of the fact that it might be several months to a couple years before any substantial income starts coming in? This questions answer could be quite long. There are potentially many items you can defer. However, one I can say is that you might consider deferring incorporation. An individual can perform a business activity and draw income from it legally in a lot of situations. For tax purposes, this is sometimes referred to as \"ScheduleC\" income. Im not saying incorporation is a bad thing it can shield you from a lot of issues, but I am saying that its not necessary on day 1 for a lot of small businesses. Having said that, this too can be easy to do on your own. Many companies offer services so you can incorporate for a few hundred dollars. If you do incorporate, as a small business of one person, I would definitely consider a tax concept called an \"SCorp\" to avoid paying double taxes. But here too, weve gone down the tax rabbit hole again. "

    "content": "There are two different issues at play here, and they are completely separate from each other A bank or cashiers check is \"safer\" than a regular personal or business check because it avoids problem 1. Problem 2 exists with all kinds of paper checks. I assume the reason the warnings are about cashiers check moreso than personal checks, is simply because people already know to wait for personal checks to clear before handing over merchandise to the buyer. People are less likely to do that when receiving cashiers checks, but perhaps they still should if there is any doubt about the validity of the check. One could argue that a cashiers check actually provides a false sense of security due to this to the receiver. On the flip side, if you are the payer, then a cashiers check could be thought of as more secure than a personal check because you dont have to reveal your bank account information to a stranger."

    "topic": "Option Theta What conditions are needed for Theta  PN, where P  option price, and N  days to expiration?",
    "content": "So, if an outofthemoney option all time value has a price P say 3.00, and there are N days... The extrinsic value isnt solely determined by time value as your quote suggests. Its also based on volatility and demand. Here is a quote from httpwww.tradingmarkets.comoptionstradinglessonsthemysteryofoptionextrinsicvalue767484.html distinguishing between extrinsic time value and extrinsic nontime value The time value of an option is entirely predictable. Time value premium declines at an accelerating rate, with most time decay occurring in the last one to two months before expiration. This occurs on a predictable curve. Intrinsic value is also predictable and easily followed. It is worth one point for every point the option is in the money. For example, a call with a strike of 30 has three points of intrinsic value when the current value of the underlying stock is 33 per share and a 40 put has two points of intrinsic value when the underlying stock is worth 38. The third type of premium, extrinsic value, increases or decreases when the underlying stock changes and when the distance between current value of stock and strike of the option get closer together. As a symptom of volatility, extrinsic value may be greater for highly volatile underlying stock, and lower for less volatile stocks. Extrinsic value is the only classification of option premium that is unpredictable. The SPYs you point out probably had a volatility component affecting value. This portion is a factor of expectations or uncertainty. So an event expected to conclude prior to expiration, but of unknown outcome can cause theta to be higher than pn. For example, a drug company is being sued and the outcome of a trial will determine whether that company pays out millions or not. The extrinsic will be higher than pn prior to the outcome of the trial then drops after. Of course, the most common situation where this happens is earnings. After the announcement, its not unusual to see a dramatic drop in the extrinsic portion of options. This is why sometimes a new option trader gets angry when buying calls prior to earnings. When surprise good earnings are announced as hoped, the rise is stock price is largely offset by a fall in extrinsic value giving call holders little or no gain! As for the reverse situation where theta is lower than pn would expect? Well you can actually have negative theta meaning the extrinsic portion rises over time. this statement is a little confusing because theta is usually described as negative, but since you describe it as a positive number, negative here means the opposite of what youd expect. This is a quote from \"Option Volatility  Pricing\". Keep in mind that they use positive theta to mean the time value increases up over time Is it ever possible for an option to have a positive theta such that if nothing changes the option will be worth more tomorrow than it is today? When futures options are subject to stocktype settlement, as they currently are in the United States, the carrying cost on a deeply inthemoney option, either a call or a put, can, under some circumstances, be greater than the volatility component. If this happens, and the option is European no early exercise permitted, it will have a theoretical value less than parity less than intrinsic value. As expiration approaches, the value of the option will slowly rise to parity. Hence, the option will have a positive theta. Sheldon Natenberg.

    "content": "An instant 15 profit sounds good to me, so you cant go wrong selling as soon as you are able. Here are a couple other considerations Tax implications When you sell the stock, you have to pay taxes on the profit including that 15 discount. The tax rate you pay is based on how long you wait to sell it. If you wait a certain amount of time usually 2 years, but it will depend on your specific tax codes before you sell, you could be subject to lower tax rates on that profit. See here for a more detailed description. This might only apply if youre in the US. Since you work for the company, you may be privy to a bit more information about how the company is run and how likely it is to grow. As such, if you feel like the company is headed in the right direction, you may want to hold on the the stock for a while. I am generally wary of being significantly invested in the company you work for. If the company goes south, then the stock price will obviously drop, but youll also be at risk to be laid off. As such youre exposed much more risk than investing in other companies. This is a good argument to sell the stock and take the 15 profit.   I realize your question wasnt really about whether to sell the stock, but more for when, but I felt this was relevant nonetheless."

    "topic": "Should market based health insurance premiums be factored into 6 months emergency fund savings?",
    "content": "Yes, you should budget some amount of your emergency fund for healthcare expenses. How much you budget is really dependent on your particular anticipated costs. Be aware that health insurance likely costs significantly more than your employer charges you for access to its plan. Since healthcare reform mandated guaranteed issue individual coverage you will have the ability to buy individual coverage for you and, if applicable, your family. When buying individual coverage you have essentially two choices, your decision hinges on whether or not youd qualify for a premium subsidy. If your AGI is below 400 of the poverty line youll be able to receive subsidized coverage at a state or federal health insurance exchange. If the subsidy is not meaningful to you, or you wouldnt qualify, you can buy an \"off exchange\" plan offered either directly through a carrier or an insurance agent some insurance agents are also licensed to sell exchange plans though its somewhat rare. In order to receive subsidized coverage you must buy through a state or federal exchange, or an agent licensed to sell exchange products specifically. If your employer was large enough to be required to offer its plan via COBRA or you live in a state that extends the COBRA requirement to smaller businesses, you can choose that as well. Bear in mind this option is likely to be expensive relative to individual plans. Its becoming a less relevant solution with the advent of guaranteed issue individual coverage. COBRA is not a special type of insurance, its a mandate that your employer allow you to remain on its plan but pay the full gross premium plus an up to 2 10 for calCOBRA administrative fee. Despide popular vernacular, there is no such thing as Obamacare or ACA coverage. Obamacare reshaped the insurance market. The ACA outlines certain minimum coverage requirements, generally referred to as \"Minimum Essential Coverage.\" While employers and plans are not \"required\" to meet all of these coverage requirements there is a penalty associated with noncompliance. The single exception to this is grandfathered plans which can still sidestep a few of the requirements. The penalty is harsh enough that its not worth the cost of offering a noncompliant plan. Whether you buy coverage through a state or federal exchange, through an insurance agent, or via your employers COBRA program you will have \"ACA\" coverage unless on the off chance your employers plan doesnt check the \"Minimum Essential Coverage\" box. So generally all plans available to you will have 0 preventive coverage, pregnancy benefits, cancer treatment benefits etc. Another thing to consider is your entire family doesnt need to be on the same plan. If your family is healthy with the exception of one child, you can purchase 0 deductible coverage for the one child and higher deductible more catastrophic plan for the remainder of your family. In fact you could choose COBRA for one child and purchase individual coverage for the remainder of the family. The things to consider when you face a layoff I tried to mitigate my use of \"all\" and \"always\" because there are some narrow exceptions to these requirements, such as the \"Hobby Lobby\" decision allowing closely held organizations with highly religious owners the ability to remove certain contraception benefits. Understand that these exceptions are rare and not available to individual plans."

    "topic": "why do I need an emergency fund if I already have investments?",
    "content": "There are a few major risks to doing something like that. First, you should never invest money you cant afford to lose. An emergency fund is money you cant afford to lose  by definition, you may need to have quick access to that money. If you determine that you need, for example, 3000 in emergency savings, that means that you need to have at least 3000 at all times  if you lose 500, then you now only have 2500 in emergency savings. Imagine what couldve happened if you had invested your emergency savings during the 2008 crash, for example you could easily have been in a position where you lost both your job and a good portion of your emergency savings at the same time, which is a terrible position to be in. If the car breaks down, you cant really say \"nows a bad time, wait until the stock market bounces back.\" Second, with brokerage accounts, there may be a delay before you can actually access the money or transfer it to an account that you can actually withdraw cash from or write checks against but some of this depends on the exact arrangement you have with your bank. This can be a problem if youre in a situation where you need immediate access to the money  if your furnace breaks in the middle of winter, you probably dont want to wait a few days for the sale and transfer to go through before you can have it fixed. Third, you can be forced to sell the investments at an unfavorable price because youre not sure when youre going to need it. Youd also likely incur trading fees andor early withdrawal penalties when you tried to withdraw the money. Think about it this way if you buy a bond that matures in 5 years, youre effectively betting that you wont have an emergency for the next 5 years. If you do, youll have to either sell the bond or, if youre allowed to get the money back early, youll likely forfeit a good amount of the interest you earned in the process which kind of kills the point of buying the bond in the first place. Edit As Barmar pointed out in the comments, you may also have to pay taxes on the profits if you sell at a favorable price. In the U.S. at least, capital gains on stuff held for less than a year is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate and stuff held longer than a year is taxed at the longterm capital gains tax rate. So, if you hold the investment for less than a year, youre opening yourself up to the risks of shortterm stock fluctuations as well as potential tax penalties, so if you put your emergency fund in stocks youre essentially betting that you wont have an emergency that year which by definition you cant know. The purpose of an emergency fund is just that  to be an emergency fund. Its purpose isnt really to make money."

    "content": "A lot depends on whether your mortgage payments are interest only or repayment and what the remaining term is on each of the mortgages. Either way I suspect that the best value for the money you put in will be had by making payments to the larger, newer mortgage. This is because the quicker you reduce the capital owed the less interest you will pay over the whole term of the mortgage and youve already had the older mortgage for sometime unless you remortgaged so the benefit you can get from an arbitrary reduction in the capital is inevitably less than you will get from the same reduction in the capital of the newer mortgage. Even if the two mortgages are the same age then the benefit of putting money into the one on the new house is greater due to the greater interest charged on it."

There is an answer in the other question, where a guy only invested in small amounts and had a big sum by the time he retired. There is good logic in the answer. If you put in lump sum in a single stroke you will get at a single price. But if you distribute it over a time, you will get opportunities to buy at favorable prices, because that is an inherent behavior of stocks. They inherently go up and down, dont remain stable. Stock markets are for everybody rich or poor as long as you have money, doesnt matter in millions or hundreds, to invest and you select stocks with proper research and with a long term view. Investment should always start in small amounts before you graduate to investing in bigger amounts. Gives you ample time to learn. Where do I go to do this ? To a bank ? To the company, most probably a brokerage firm. Any place to your liking. Check how much they charge for brokerage, annual charges and what all services they provide. Compare them online on what services you require, not what they provide ? Ask friends and colleagues and get their opinions. It is better to get firsthand knowledge about the products. Can the company Im investing to be abroad? At the moment stay away from it, unless you are sure about it because you are starting. Can try buying ADRs, like in US. This is an option in UK.

Also, if you are looking at a strategy for using stop losses, try taking into account the support lines if you are going long. So, if the stock is on an upward trend but is dropping back from profit taking, your best best is to take a position closest to the next support line. You place your stop just below the support. this will give you the best chance of a winning position as most technical analysts will have looking towards the support as a buy back area. Obviously, in a bear market the opposite is true. If you have taken your position and the market move past the first resistance line, then bring your stop to just below that line as once resistance is broken, it then becomes support. You then have a profitable position with profit locked in. Leave the position to break the next resistance and repeat."

If youre a potential target for lawsuits, e.g. a doctor worried about medical malpractice suits, variable annuities may be an option for you. As always, you should consult a legaltax professional to see if this might be a good option for you to consider. The SEC also has a fantastic publication on variable annuities that provides a great deal of information.

They get some preferential tax treatment and regulation and their deposits are insured by a separate organization if federally accredited. Statechartered credit unions dont have to maintain deposit insurance at all. Their charters specify who can join. They can be regionally based, employer based, or based on some other group with common interests. Regulators restrict them so that they dont interfere too much with banks. Otherwise their preferential tax and regulatory treatment would leave banks uncompetitive. Other organizations with similar limits have gone on to be competitive when the limits were released. For example, there used to be an insurance company just for government employees, the Government Employees Insurance Company. You may know it better as GEICO yes, the one with the gecko advertisements. Now they offer life and auto insurance all over. Credit unions would like looser limitations or no limitations at all, but not enough to give up their preferential tax treatment.

    "content": "Having a debt on a balance sheet does impact the capability and willingness of the company to pay dividend. But more than this it depends on the profitability of the company. If the company is profitable, there is no reasons why its share holders should not be rewarded. If the company does not have debt, lot of money and no profit, normally no or a symbolic dividend is paid. It is a good move by Fort. Dividend is the effective way of paying something back to the shareholders."

    "content": "Partly I suspect this is selection bias. You say you see so many luxury cars go by. But if youre looking for them, youre going to notice them. Have you calculated the actual percentage? Do they make up 50 of the cars that pass a specific point in a specific period of time? Or just 10 if you really counted? You say you live in Baltimore county, Maryland. Thats a relatively wealthy area, so Id expect the percentage of luxury cars to be higher than the national average. Youd likely see considerably fewer in the backwoods of Mississippi. That said, some people who own luxury cars cant really afford them. Im reminded of a wonderful TV commercial I saw recently where a man is showing off all his material goods, he talks about his big house, and his swimming pool, and his fancy car, with a big smile on his face, standing tall, and generally looking proud and happy. And then he says, \"How do I do it?\" And suddenly his expression changes to complete despair, he slumps down, and says, \"Im in debt up to my eyeballs.\" It turns out to be a commercial for a debtcounseling service. Some people put very high value on owning a fancy car and are willing to sacrifice on other things. If having a big fancy car is more important to you then, say, having a nice house or the latest computer or a big screen TV or dining out more often or going on more expensive vacations or whatever you have to give up to get the car, well, thats your decision. Personally I dont care much about a fancy car, I just want something that gets me where I want to go. And Ive always figured that with an expensive car, you have to constantly worry about getting in an accident and damaging or destroying it. If you put your money into a big fancy house, at least houses rarely collide with each other. Personally, I make a nice income too. And I have a 500month mortgage and zero car payment because I drive a 2003 pickup that I bought with cash. But I have two kids in college and Im trying to get them through with no debt, thats where all my money is going."

This is a factor as 3,000 of an openend fund will automatically go into fractional shares that isnt necessarily the case of an ETF where you have to specify a number of shares when you purchase as well as consider are you doing a market or limit order? These are a couple of things to keep in mind here. Lastly, what if the broker you use charges account maintenance fees for your account?

This is because even for the most expensive equities, those fractional shares would still not be worth whole cent amounts, even for account balances in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. One important thing to remember is that when dealing with equities the total cost, number of shares, and share price are all 3 components of the same value. Thus if you take 2 of those values, you can always calculate the third price  shares  cost, cost  price  shares, etc. What youre seeing in your account 9 decimal places is probably the result of dividing uneven values such as 9.37 invested in a commodity which trades for 235.11, results in 0.03985368550891072264046616477394 shares. Most brokerages will round this value off somewhere, yours just happens to include more decimal places than your financial software allows.

Most CFD brokers will have their overnight financing rates set at  or  2.5 or 3 from the countrys official interest rates. So if your countrys official interest rate is 5 and your broker uses  or  2.5, you will get a 2.5 credit for any short positions held overnight and pay 7.5 fee for any long positions held overnight. In Australia the official interest rate is 2.5, so I get 0 for short positions and pay 5 for long positions held overnight. If you are looking to hold positions open long term especially long positions you might think twice before using CFDs to trade as you may end up paying quite a bit in interest over a long period of time. These financing fees are charged because you are borrowing the funds to open your positions, If you buy shares directly you would not be charged such overnight financing fees."

    "content": "Vanguards Admiral shares are like regular \"investor\" shares in their funds, only they charge lower expense ratios. They have higher investment minimums, though. For instance, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund has a minimum of 3,000 and an expense ratio of .18 for the Investor Shares class, but a minimum of 10,000 and an expense ratio of .07 for Admiral Shares. If youve bought a bunch of investor shares and now meet the recentlyreduced minimum for Admiral shares, or if you have some and buy some more investor shares in the future and meet the minimums, you will qualify for a free, notaximpact conversion to the Admiral Shares and save yourself some money. For more information, see the Vanguard article on their recent changes to Admiral Shares minimums. Vanguard also offers institutionalclass shares with even lower expense ratios than that with a minimum of 5 million, .06 expense ratios on the same fund. A lot of the costs of operating a fund are perindividual, so they dont need to charge you extra fees for putting in more money after a certain point. Theyd rather be competitive and offer it at cost. Vanguards funds typically have very low expense ratios to begin with. The investor shares Ive been using as an example are advertised as \"84 lower than the average expense ratio of funds with similar holdings\". In fact, Vanguards whole reason for existing is the premise stated in founder John C Bogles undergraduate thesis at Princeton that individuals can generally get better returns by investing in a cheap fund that tracks an index than by investing in mutual funds that try to pick stocks and beat the index and charge you a steep markup. The average real return of the stock market is supposedly something like 4 even a smalllooking percentage like 1 can eat a big portion of that. Over the course of 40 years waiting for retirement, saving 1 on expenses could leave you with something like 50 more money when youve retired. If you are interested in the lower expense ratios of the Admiral share classes but cannot meet the minimums, note that funds which are available as ETFs can be traded from Vanguard brokerage accounts commissionfree and typically charge the same expense ratios as the Admiral shares without any minimums but you need to trade them as individual shares, and this is less convenient than moving them around in specific dollar amounts."

This dramatically increases the risk of any investment, and I would no longer classify it as passive income. The mortgage on a 150K place would be about 710month 30 year fixed. Reasonably I would expect no more than 1200month in rent, or 14,400. A good rule of thumb is to assume that half of rental revenue can be counted as profit before debt service. So in your case 7200, but you would have a mortgage payment of 473month. Leaving you a profit of 1524 after debt service. This is suspiciously like 2K per year. Things, in the financial world, tend to move toward an equilibrium. The benefit of rental property you can make a lot more than the numbers suggest. For example the home could increase in value, and you can have fewer than expected repairs. So you have two ways to profit rental revenue and asset appreciation. However, you said that you needed passive income. What happens if you have a vacancy or the tenant does not pay? What happens if you have greater than expected repairs? What happens if you get a fine from the HOA or a special assessment? Not only will you have dip into your pocket to cover the payment, you might also have to dip into your pocket to cover the actual event! In a way this would be no different than if you borrowed 100K to buy dividend paying stocks. If the fundcompany does not pay out that month you would still have to make the loan payment. Where does the money come from? Your pocket. At least dividend paying companies dont collect money from their shareholders. Yes you can make more money, but you can also lose more.

If popcorn were priced so that most patrons bought some the theater manager would have to have lots of employees to sell popcorn on the really busy days. The manager would have to cover the cost of wages on the slow days. A simple solution would be to adjust employee hours. To a certain extent I suspect this is done. If you look at the situation from the standpoint of the employee being sent home early or being told not to work tomorrow or, perhaps for the next week because the theater has a bunch of bombs, is not a good situation. A job in popcorn sales is probably not a high paying job so the employees may just quit and they may do this, not by giving notice, but rather by not showing up for a scheduled shift. The result of this is that managers determine the maximum number of employees they can hire if there theater has low drawing movies and they set the price of popcorn so that when the theater is filled this number of employees will not be overwhelmed by patron buying popcorn. At least not to the extent that the start of the movie has to be delayed."

Traditional mutual funds, including moneymarket funds, keep a small fraction of their assets in cash for daytoday transactions, maybe 1. If you invest 1, they put that in the cash bucket and issue you a share. If you and 999 other people invest 100 each, not offset by people redeeming, they take the aggregated 100,000 and buy a bond or two. Conversely, if you redeem one share it comes out of cash, but if lots of people redeem they sell some bonds to cover those redemptions  which works as long as the bonds can in fact be sold for close enough to their recorded value. And this doesnt mean they \"cant fail\". Even though they are almost totally invested in securities that are thought to be among the safest and most liquid available, in sufficiently extreme circumstances those investments can fall in market value, or they can become illiquid and unavailable to cover \"withdrawals\" redemptions. ETFs are also fully invested, but the process is less direct. You dont just send money to the fund company. Instead Thus as long as the underlyings for your ETF hold their value, which for a money market they are designed to, and the markets are open and the market maker firms are operating, your ETF shares are well backed.

I explained it in details in my blog post, but in short  it is either an EA Enrolled Agent, with the IRS credentials, or a CPA Certified Public Accountant or Attorney licensed in your State. Back to your question  \"Excess Contribution\" to a IRA is when you contribute in excess to the limits imposed. For Traditional IRA in 2012 the limit was 5000. You contributed 4000  this means that you were not in excess. Theres nothing they can \"correct\", the 1099R you got seems to be correct and in order. What you did have was a case of nondeductible contribution. Nondeductible contribution to your IRA should have been reported to the IRS on form 8606. Nondeductible contribution creates basis in your IRA. Withdrawals from your IRA are prorated to the relation of your basis to your total value, and the taxable amount is determined based on that rate. It is, also, calculated using form 8606. So in short  you should have filed a form 8606 with your 2012 tax return declaring nondeductible IRA and creating 4000 basis, and then form 8606 with your 2013 tax return calculating which portion of the 4000 you withdrew is nontaxable. If your total IRA in all accounts was that 4000  then nothing would be taxable. Talk to a tax adviser, you might need to amend your 2012 return or send the 2012 form separately, if possible, and then do some math on your 2013 return. If 60 days havent passed, you might want to consider depositing the 4000 in a Roth IRA and perform what is called \"Conversion\"."

    "content": "Chris, this is an arbitrage question with a twist you cannot treat the location you want to live objectively. For example, why not SoCal instead of Texas? Yes, SoCals expensive but what if you account for the weather? This question is very interesting for me personally something I am going to focus on myself, soon, as well. To the question at hand its very hard to get a close estimate of the price from a single source, say, a website. The cost of a house is always negotiable and theres no sticker price, and there begins your problems. However, there are some publicly available information which websites aggregate, see httpwww.citydata.com Also, some heuristics might help Rent is atleast as expensive as the monthly mortgage, property taxes, HOA fees, etc. Smart people have told me this, and this also makes sense to me as the landlord is in this business to make some money after all. However, there are also other hidden costs of home ownership that I am not aware of in details and which I craftily sidestepped in my \"etc\" above that could put a rental to be \"cheaper\". One example that comes to mind is you as a tenant get to complain if the washerdryer misbehaves and demand the landlord get you a new one see how you wouldnt make a sound were you to own it however Such a website to gauge rentals httpwww.rentometer.com Houses cost more where the median income is more. Again, you cannot be objective about this because smart people like to live around smart people and pay for the privilege. Turn again to httpwww.citydata.com to get this information Better weather is more expensive than not so good weather. In the article you linked, notice the ratio of homes in California. Yes, I know of people who sold off their family ranches in Vancouver and Seattle to buy homes in Orange Country. In short, there is a lot of information you would have to gather from multiple sources, and even then never be sure that you did your best! This also includes arbitrage, as you would like to \"come out ahead\" and while you are doing your research and paying your rent, you want to invest your \"savings\" in instruments where you earn more than what you would have saved in a mortgage, etc. I would very much like to be refuted on every point and my answer be edited and \"made better\" as I need the same answers as you do D Feel free to comment, edit your question etc and I will act on feedback and help both of us and future readers out!"

Usually this comes in the form in a margin account, which an investor uses to borrow money at a low interest rate, invest the money, and hopefully! beat the interest rate. is this approach unwise? That completely depends on how your investments perform and how high your loans interest rate is. The higher your loans interest rate, the more risky your investments will have to be in order to beat the interest rate. If you can get a return which beats the interest rates of your loan then congratulations! You have come out ahead and made a profit. If you can keep it up you should make the minimum payment on your loan to maximize the amount of capital you can invest. If not, then it would be better to just use your extra cash to pay down the loan. [are] there really are investments aside from stocks and such that I can try to use to my advantage? With interest rates as low as they are right now at least in the US youll probably be hardpressed to find a savings account or CD that will return a higher interest rate than your loans.

    "content": "Fire insurance, as you have discovered, is a complete ripoff. Most people pay fire insurance all their lives with no benefit whatsoever, and those such as yourself who are lucky enough to get a payout find that it is completely insufficient to replace their loss. I once computed the actual beneficial net present financial value of my fire insurance policy and it came out to 40 per month. The cost was 800 per month. That is typical. Homeowners pay 500 to 800 per year for something that is worth 30 to 50 per year. Ironically banks would actually make more money from mortgages if they did not require mortgagees to buy insurance, but nevertheless they insist on it. It is not about logic, but about fear and irrationality. When I paid off my mortgage and gained ownership of my home the first thing I did was cancel my fire insurance. I now invest the money I would have wasted on insurance, making money instead of losing it. Being compelled to throw money down the toilet on fire insurance is one of the hidden costs of a homeowners mortgage in the United States. In your situation, the main option is to borrow the money to rebuild the house using the land as collateral, if the land is valuable enough. Of course, you still owe the money for your original mortgage on your now nonexistent home. So, to get a home, you will have to have the income to service two mortgages. A loan officer at a reputable bank can tell you whether you have the income necessary to support two mortgages. If you were maxed out on your original mortgage, then you may not have enough income and you are screwed. In that case you will have to go back to renting and gradually paying off your old mortgage. If it were me, I would sue the insurance company pro se as a way to get the necessary money to rebuild the home, because insurance companies roll over like a 20 hooker when they get sued. Juries hate insurance companies. But I am unusual in that I love courtrooms and suing people. Most people are terrified of courtrooms though, so it may not be an option for you."

Looking at the CIBC top 10 holdings does seem to suggest that its poorly actively managed instead of being an index tracker for what thats worth.

    "topic": "What makes a Companys Stock prices go up or down?",
    "content": "Its been said before, but to repeat succinctly, a companys current share price is no more or less than what \"the market\" thinks that share is worth, as measured by the price at which the shares are being bought and sold. As such, a lot of things can affect that price, some of them material, others ethereal. A common reason to own stock is to share the profits of the company by owning 1 share out of 1 million shares outstanding, you are entitled to 11000000 of that companys quarterly profits if any. These are paid out as dividends. Two key measurements are based on these dividend payments the first is \"earnings per share\", which is the companys stated quarterly profits, divided by outstanding shares, with the second being the \"priceearnings ratio\" which is the current price of the stock divided by its EPS. Your expected \"yield\" on this stock is more or less the inverse of this number if a company has a PE ratio of 20, then all things being equal, if you invest 100 in this stock you can expect a return of 5, or 5 120. As such, changes in the expected earnings per share can cause the share price to rise or fall to maintain a PE ratio that the pool of buyers are willing to tolerate. News that a company might miss its profit expectations, due to a decrease in consumer demand, an increase in raw materials costs, labor, financing, or any of a multitude of things that industry analysts watch, can cause the stock price to drop sharply as people look for better investments with higher yields. However, a large PE ratio is not necessarily a bad thing, especially for a large stable company. That stability means the company is better able to weather economic problems, and thus it is a lower risk. Now, not all companies issue dividends. Apple is probably the most wellknown example. The company simply retains all its earnings to reinvest in itself. This is typically the strategy of a smaller startup whether theyre making good money or not, they typically want to keep what they make so they can keep growing, and the shareholders are usually fine with that. Why? Well, because theres more than one way to value a company, and more than one way to look at a stock. Owning one share of a stock can be seen quite literally as owning a share of that company. The share can then be valued as a fraction of the companys total assets. Sounds simple, but it isnt, because not every asset the company owns has a line in the financial statements. A companys brand name, for instance, has no tangible value, and yet it is probably the most valuable single thing Apple owns. Similarly, intellectual property doesnt have a \"book value\" on a companys balance sheet, but again, these are huge contributors to the success and profitability of a company like Apple the company is viewed as a center of innovation, and if it were not doing any innovating, it would very quickly be seen as a middleman for some other companys ideas and products. A company cant sustain that position for long even if its raking in the money in the meantime. Overall, the value of a company is generally a combination of these two things by owning a portion of stock, you own a piece of the companys assets, and also claim a piece of their profits. A large company with a lot of material assets and very little debt can be highly valued based solely on the sum of its parts, even if profits are lagging. Conversely, a company more or less operating out of a storage unit can have a patent on the cure for cancer, and be shoveling money into their coffers with bulldozers."

    "topic": "What do the terms par value, purchase price, call price, call date, and coupon rate mean in the context of bonds?",
    "content": "Unless stated otherwise, these terms apply to all bonds. The par value or face value of a bond refers to the value of the bond when its redeemed at maturity. A bond with a par value of 10,000 simply means that if you purchase the bond and hold it until the maturity date specified in the contract, you receive 10,000. The purchase price, however, is exactly that its what you paid for the bond. Bonds may sell below, at, or above par. Continuing the example from above, if you paid 9,800 for a bought a bond with a 10,000 par value, you bought the bond below par. A bond selling below par is said to be selling at a discount. For bonds selling above bar, theyre selling at a premium. If the purchase price and the par value are the same, the bond is selling at par. These terms apply to callable bonds only, which are bond contracts that allow the issuer of the bond in the case of municipal bonds, the institution or agency who created the contract to buy back from bond holders at a given date the call date and at a given price the call price before the bond reaches maturity and pays the holder the full par value. Yes, the coupon rate is essentially the interest paid. Its usually represented as a percent of the par value, so if the 10,000 in the example above had a 5 coupon rate, this means that it paid out 0.05  10,000  500 each year. Usually, this payment is made as two semiannual payments of 250. Some bonds are zerocoupon bonds, which means exactly what you would think they dont make any coupon payments. U.S. Treasury Bills are one example of a zerocoupon bond. All of these factors are linked, because the coupon rate, callable provisions, and par value, along with the overall economic environment, can affect the purchase price of a bond."

You have two real options If he will listen, go though and look at money in v.s. money out. If money out is larger then money in, your screwed. Make sure to point out that he should look at real money in left a bank account and real money out deposited to a bank account. Again be prepared for the fact that he is actually making money.

    "content": "A Credit Default Swap CDS is a contract between two parties. A useful analogy is insurance but by no means exact. I pay a quarterly premium in order to insure myself against another event. In this case, it might be that I own some IBM Bonds. I am happy to own those bonds, and like the \"coupon\" that they pay me. But I am a little worried about IBM going bankrupt. So I can find someone willing to sell me a CDS. So long as I keep up my \"premium\" payments, if IBM goes into default on their bonds, I get a payout. This analogy does break down at a couple of levels. Firstly there is no requirement that I have to own the IBM bond in the first place. I can in effect then \"take a view\" on IBM going into default by purchasing a CDS without owning the underlying asset. Also in the real insurance world, there are various capital requirements that the companies have to adhere to, while CDS market, being essentially unregulated has none. So to summarize, and while The Pedia has a pretty good article, they are good both to hedge your bet i.e. protect your actual owned asset or as a speculative tool to take a \"view\" on the likelihood of a company to go bankrupt."

Youd have to take out an unsecured loan, which has a higher interest rate, or a secured loan and put at risk whatever you are securing the loan with. You need some means to make payments on the loan, or if interest is being added to the balance then take the compounding effect into account with regards to the cost of the money and how much you will really end up owning. In order to come out ahead you need to invest in something that will yield a return that is higher than the cost of borrowing the money, such high yields always come with higher risk, meaning that you will actually GET that return is less and less of a sure thing.. so now you are talking about the chance to make money, Or a chance your investment could fail, perhaps badly. Meaning you could well do nothing but end up in debt with little to nothing to show for it.

    "topic": "How can one protect oneself from a dividend stock with decreasing price?",
    "content": "An alternative options strategy to minimize loss of investment capital is to buy a put, near the money around your original buy price, with a premium less than the total dividend. The value of the put will increase if the stock price falls quickly. Likely, a large portion of your dividend will go towards paying the option premium, this will however ensure that your capital doesnt drop much lower than your buy price. Continued dividend distributions will continue to pay to buy future put options. Risks here are if the stock does not have a very large up or down movement from your original buy price causing most of the dividend to be spent on insuring your position. It may take a few cycles, but once the stock has appreciated in value say 10 above buying price, you can consider either skipping the put insurance so you can pocket the dividend, or you can bu ythe put with a higher strike price for additional insurance against a loss of gains. Again, this sacrifices much of the dividend in favor of price loss, and still is open to a risk of neutral price movement over time."

The courts are usually much more reasonable about this sort of thing and recognise that a payment plan over several years with an affordable monthly payment is MUCH more likely to actually get the creditor their money back than any other strategy. They will also recognise and appreciate that you have made significant efforts to obtain the money. Im also worried about your statement about how panicked and \"ready to give up\" you are. Is there someone you can talk to? Around here UK we have debt counselling bureaus  they cant help with money for the actual debt itself, but they can help you with strategies for dealing with debt and will explain all parts of the process to you, what your rights and responsibilities are if it does go to court, etc. If you have something similar I suggest you contact them, even just to speak to someone and find out that this isnt the end of the world. Its a sucky situation but in a few years youll be able to look back and at least laugh wryly at it."

    "content": "In my experience, Shiller is always way before his time with his predictions and often it comes at too early a point for anyone actually making some money to care about. His view is very long term  and I trust his predictions, because he so accurately predicted so many of the homepocalypse, and the measures that would follow. He even predicted that there would be bailouts in his book \"Irrational Exuberance\". His opinons were poopood as doom and gloom and manipulative until every piece started falling apart in the specific order of events give or take that they did. I personally think people like Dr. Shiller make bold predictions that are hard to swallow. The derivatives market is a bit skittish about rolling into bull territory with any kind of housing index, but Warren Buffets old adage to \"buy when everyone is selling and sell when everyone is buying.\" paraphrase. I see this as a good longterm investment because I trust Shillers judgement, he stuck to his guns when the doubts were lobbed at him incessantly and Krugman, et. al. to some extent, and he turned out to be more than vindicated. To me, these kinds of sources are usually pretty sound. The man knows what hes talking about, and I wouldnt mind picking up a piece of that action, especially if the market just doesnt trust any real estate investments. Its pretty easy to realize that right now housing will be undervalued and now that mortgage applications are supposedly stricter, I think theres a good argument to be made that this economist should continue to exceed expectations."

    "content": "Employee Stock Purchase Plans ESPPs were heavily neutered by U.S. tax laws a few years ago, and many companies have cut them way back. While discounts of 15 were common a decade ago, now a company can only offer negligible discounts of 5 or less tax free, and you can just as easily get that from fluctuations in the market. These are the features to look for to determine if the ESPP is even worth the effort As for a cash value, if a plan has at least one of those features, and you believe the stock has real long term value, you still have to determine how much of your money you can afford to divert into stock. If the discount is 5, the company is paying you an extra 5 on the money you put into the plan."

There is a logical minimum, the scrap value of the assets and the cash on hand. However, that doesnt take into account the expectations for growth people have for that company. If everyone thought a 100 mil company was going to be worth 200 mil by the end of next year, theyd still be willing to pay at a 150 mil price point now. That said, the market is big enough that its easy enough to find someone who has those growth expectations. They still expect it to be worth more in the future, and theyll buy it now. And if no one buys at that price point, thats when prices start to fall."

    "content": "The reason for borrowing instead of paying cash for major renovations should be the same for the decision about whether to borrow or pay cash for the home itself. Over history, borrowing using low, taxdeductible interest while increasing your retirement contributions has always yielded higher returns than paying off mortgage principal over the long term. You should first determine how much you need to save for retirement, factor that into your budget, then borrow as much as needed and can afford to live at whatever level of home you decide is important to you. Using this same logic, if interest rates are low enough, it would behoove you to refinance with cash out leveraging the cash to use as additional retirement savings."

If you use the standard deduction in the US assuming United States, you will have 0 benefit from a mortgage. If you itemize deductions, then your interest paid not principal and your property tax paid is deductible and reduces your income for tax purposes. If your marginal tax rate is 25 and you pay 10000 in interest and property tax, then when you file your taxes, youll owe or get a refund of 2500 marginal tax rate  amount of interest  property tax. I have heard the term \"The equity on your home is like a bank\". What does that mean? I suppose I could borrow using the equity in my home as collateral? If you pay an extra 500 to your mortgage, then your equity in your house goes up by 500 as well. When you pay down the principal by 500 on a car loan depreciating asset you end up with less than 500 in value in the car because the cars value is going down. When you do the same in an appreciating asset, you still have that money available to you though you either need to sell or get a loan to use that money. Are there any other general benefits that would drive me from paying 800 in rent, to owning a house? There are several other benefits. These are a few of the positives, but know that there are many negatives to home ownership and the cost of real estate transactions usually dictate that buying doesnt make sense until you want to stay put for 57 years. A shorter duration than that usually are better served by renting. The amount of maintenance on a house you own is almost always under estimated by new home owners."

It can also vary for the same person from year to year, month to month, day to day, or even hour to hour as a person analyzes different products and prices to determine which imparts the most value to him or her at a given point in time. In regards to losing money in your investment accounts. This reminds of a book I read on Jesse Livermore. Jesse was a famous stock broker who made millions in the 1920s so he would be a billionaire in todays money in the stock market multiple times. Jesse felt like you  he felt like after a while the losses on paper did not seem to concern him as much as he thought it should. He thought it was due to the investment accounts being simply being numbers on papers and not cold, hard cash. So what did Jesse do to remove the abstract nature of investment accounts? From here Livermore always sold out all his positions at the end of every year and had the cash deposited in his account at the Chase Manhattan Bank. Then he would arrange with the bank to have the money, in cash, in the banks vault in chests. There was a desk, a chair, a cot and an easy chair in the middle of the cash. On the occasion described in 1923, there was 50 million in cash. In the corner was a fridge with food, enough for a few days. There was lighting installed. Then, like Scrooge McDuck, Livermore would have himself locked in the vault with his cash. He would stay a couple of days and review his year from every aspect. After his stay was over, he would fill his pockets with cash and go on a shopping spree. He would also take a vacation and not reenter the market until February. But unlike Scrooge McDuck, this was not the act of a miser, explains Smitten. Livermore lived a world of paper transactions all year long. He believed that by the end of the year he had lost his perception of what the paper slips really represented, cash money and ultimately power. He needed to touch the money and feel the power of cash. It made him reappraise his stock and commodity positions. Imagine the 60,000 from your investment account sitting on your kitchen table. Imagine seeing 1,000 dumped into the trash can one day. I know I would appreciate the money much more seeing that happen."

You might pay early and have just a few years of payments left on the mortgage and if you are unemployed, those payments are still due. Its why Id suggest loading up retirement accounts and other savings before paying the mortgage sooner. Your point, that rates are low, and your expected return is higher, is well presented. I feel no compulsion to prepay my 3.5 mortgage. As the OP is in Canada, land of no mortgage interest deduction, I ignore that, till now. The deduction simply reduces the effective rate, based on the country tax code permitting it. Its not the reason to have a loan. But its ignorant to ignore the math."

    "topic": "Fulltime work  running small side business Best business structure for taxes?",
    "content": "A tax return is a document you sign and file with the government to selfreport your tax obligations. A tax refund is the payment you receive from the government if your payments into the tax system exceeded your obligations. As others have mentioned, if an extra 2K in income generated 5K in taxes, chances are your return was prepared incorrectly. The selection of an appropriate entity type for your business depends a lot on what you expect to see over the next several years in terms of income and expenses, and the extent to which you want or need to pay for fringe benefits or make pretax retirement contributions from your business income. There are four basic flavors of entity which are available to you Sole proprietorship. This is the simplest option in terms of tax reporting and paperwork required for ongoing operations. Your net gross minus expenses income is added to your wage income and youll pay tax on the total. If your wage income is less than approximately 100K, youll also owe selfemployment tax of approximately 15 in addition to income tax on your business income. If your business runs at a loss, you can deduct the loss from your other income in calculating your taxable income, though you wont be able to run at a loss indefinitely. You are liable for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of all of your personal assets. Partnership. You will need at least two participants humans or entities to form a partnership. Individual items of income and expense are identified on a partnership tax return, and each partners proportionate share is then reported on the individual partners tax returns. General partners who actively participate in the business also must pay selfemployment tax on their earnings below approximately 100K. Each general partner is responsible for all of the debts and obligations of the business to the extent of their personal assets. A general partnership can be created informally or with an oral agreement although thats not a good idea. Corporation. Business entities can be taxed as \"S\" or \"C\" corporations. Either way, the corporation is created by filing articles of incorporation with a state government doesnt have to be the state where you live and corporations are typically required to file yearly entity statements with the state where they were formed as well as all states where they do business. Shareholders are only liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation to the extent of their investment in the corporation. An \"S\" corporation files an informationonly return similar to a partnership which reports items of income and expense, but those items are actually taken into account on the individual tax returns of the shareholders. If an \"S\" corporation runs at a loss, the losses are deductible against the shareholders other income. A \"C\" corporation files a tax return more similar to an individuals. A C corporation calculates and pays its own tax at the corporate level. Payments from the C corporation to individuals are typically taxable as wages from a tax point of view, its the same as having a second job or as dividends, depending on how and why the payments are made. If theyre in exchange for effort and work, theyre probably wages  if theyre payments of business profits to the business owners, theyre probably dividends. If a C corporation runs at a loss, the loss is not deductible against the shareholders other income. Fringe benefits such as health insurance for business owners are not deductible as business expenses on the business returns for S corps, partnerships, or sole proprietorships. C corporations can deduct expenses for providing fringe benefits. LLCs dont have a predefined tax treatment  the members or managers of the LLC choose, when the LLC is formed, if they would like to be taxed as a partnership, an S corporation, or as a C corporation. If an LLC is owned by a single person, it can be considered a \"disregarded entity\" and treated for tax purposes as a sole proprietorship. This option is not available if the LLC has multiple owners. The asset protection provided by the use of an entity depends quite a bit on the source of the claim. If a creditorplaintiff has a claim based on a contract signed on behalf of the entity, then they likely will not be able to \"pierce the veil\" and collect the entitys debts from the individual owners. On the other hand, if a creditorplaintiff has a claim based on negligence or another tortlike action such as sexual harassment, then its very likely that the individuals involved will also be sued as individuals, which takes away a lot of the effectiveness of the purported asset protection. The entitybased asset protection is also often unavailable even for contract claims because sophisticated creditors like banks and landlords will often insist the the business owners sign a personal guarantee putting their own assets at risk in the event that the business fails to honor its obligations. Theres no particular type of entity which will allow you to entirely avoid tax. Most tax planning revolves around characterizing income and expense items in the most favorable ways possible, or around controlling the timing of the appearance of those items on the tax return."

    "content": "If you look at a trade grid you can see how this happens. If there are enough bids to cover all shares currently on the sell side at a certain price, those shares will be bought and increased price quotes will be shown for the bids and ask. If there are enough bids to cover this price, those will get bought and higher prices will be shown and this process will repeat until the sell side has more power than the buy side. It seems like this process is going on all day long with momentum either on the upside or downside. But I think that much of this bidding and selling is automatic and is being done by large trading firms and high tech computers. I also feel that many of these bids and asks are already programmed to appear once there is a price change. So once one price gets bought, computers will put in higher bids to take over asks. Its like a virtual war between trading firms and their computers. When more money is on the buy side the stock will go up, and vice versa. I sort of feel like this highfrequency trading is detrimental to the markets and doesnt really give everyone a fair shot. Retail investors do not have the resources and knowledge in order to do this sort of high frequency trading. It also seems to go against certain free market principles in my opinion."

It represents the residual assets of the company that would be due to stockholders after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt. Stockholders equity cannot be withdrawn from the company in a way that is intended to be detrimental to the companys creditors Wikipedia  Dividend A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it can reinvest it in the business called retained earnings, and pay a fraction of this reinvestment as a dividend to shareholders. Distribution to shareholders can be in cash usually a deposit into a bank account or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or share repurchase. Wikipedia  Bond In finance, a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders. It is a debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay them interest the coupon andor to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly. Very often the bond is negotiable, i.e. the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the second market. Thus, stock is about ownership in the company, dividends are the payments those owners receive, which may be additional shares or cash usually, and bonds are about lending money. Stocks are usually bought through brokers on various stock exchanges generally. An exception can be made under \"Employee Stock Purchase Plans\" and other special cases where an employee may be given stock or options that allow the purchase of shares in the company through various plans. This would apply for Canada and the US where I have experience just as a parting note. This is without getting into Convertible Bond that also exists In finance, a convertible bond or convertible note or convertible debt or a convertible debenture if it has a maturity of greater than 10 years is a type of bond that the holder can convert into a specified number of shares of common stock in the issuing company or cash of equal value. It is a hybrid security with debt and equitylike features. It originated in the mid19th century, and was used by early speculators such as Jacob Little and Daniel Drew to counter market cornering. Convertible bonds are most often issued by companies with a low credit rating and high growth potential."

Both have one or more members, and both are seen similarly emphasis on SIMILAR here, theyre not all the same to the IRS. Specifically, LLCs can opt for a passthrough tax system, basically seen by the IRS the same way an SCorp is. Put another way, you can be taxed as a corporate entity, or its PL statements can \"flow through\" to your personal taxes. When you opt for a flowthrough, the business files and you get a separate schedule to tie into your taxes. You should also look at filing a business expense schedule Schedule C on your taxes to claim legitimate business expenses good reference point here. While there are several differences see this, and this, and this between these entities, the best determination on which structure is best for you is usually if you have full time employ while youre running the business. S corps limit shares, shareholders and some deductions, but taxes are only paid by the shareholders. C corps have employees, no restrictions on types or number of stock, and no restrictions on the number of shareholders. However, this means you would become an employee of your business you have to draw monies from somewhere and would be subject to paying taxes on your income, both as an individual, and as a business employment taxes such as Social Security, Medicare, etc. From the broad view of the IRS, in most cases an LLC and a Corp are the same type of entity tax wise. In fact, most of the differences between LLCs and Corps occur in how Profitslosses are distributed between members LLCs are arbitrary to a point, and Corps base this on shares. Back to your question IMHO, you should opt for an LLC. This allows you to work out a partnership with your coworker, and allows you to disburse funds in a more flexible manner. From Wikipedia  A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation 26 CFR 1.7041 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law. Hope this helps, please do let me know if you have further questions. As always, this is not legal or tax advice, just what Ive learned in setting several LLCs and Corporate structures up over the years. EDIT As far as your formulas go, the tax rate will be based upon your personal income, for any pass through entity. This means that the same monies earned from and LLC or an Scorp, with the same expenses and the same passthrough options will be taxed the same. More reading LLC and the law Google Group"

Closing Books GnuCash Wiki The above linked wiki page has several methods to close the books if that is what you want to do  but it is not necessary. There is even a description on how to create a new file for the new year which only talks about setting up the new accounts and transactions  nothing about customers, invoices etc. Note that you can close the books without creating a new data file.

Tax rates differ between qualified and unqualifiedordinary dividends, so the distribution cant include taxes because tax rates may differ between investors. In my case I hold it in an Israeli account but the tax treaty between our countries still specifies 25 withheld tax This is another example of why tax rates differ between investors.

    "topic": "What is vested stock and yearly dividends?",
    "content": "Vesting As you may know a stock option is the right to acquire a given amount of stock at a given price. Actually acquiring the stock is referred to as exercising the option. Your company is offering you options over 200,000 shares but not all of those options can be exercised immediately. Initially you will only be able to acquire 25,000 shares the other 175,000 have conditions attached, the condition in this case presumably being that you are still employed by the company at the specified time in the future. When the conditions attached to a stock option are satisfied that option is said to have vested  this simply means that the holder of the option can now exercise that option at any time they choose and thereby acquire the relevant shares. Dividends Arguably the primary purpose of most private companies is to make money for their owners i.e. the shareholders by selling goods andor services at a profit. How does that money actually get to the shareholders? There are a few possible ways of which paying a dividend is one. Periodically potentially annually but possibly more or less frequently or irregularly the management of a company may look at how it is doing and decide that it can afford to pay so many cents per share as a dividend. Every shareholder would then receive that number of cents multiplied by the number of shares held. So for example in 4 years or so, after all your stock options have vested and assuming you have exercised them you will own 200,000 shares in your company. If the board declares a dividend of 10 cents per share you would receive 20,000. Depending on where you are and your exact circumstances you may or may not have to pay tax on this. Those are the basic concepts  as you might expect there are all kinds of variations and complications that can occur, but thats hopefully enough to get you started."

But to offer a potential solution If the mortgage company allows you to assume the whole mortgage big if you could buy the other partner out. To determine what a fair buyout would be, take the current value of the house less the remaining mortgage to get the current equity. Half that is each partners current gain or potentially loss, and could be considered a fair buyout. At this point the partner realizes any gains made in the last 5 years, and from now on the whole house and any future gains or losses will be yours. Alternatively your partner could remain a full partner if she so desires until the house sells. You would see the house as a separate business, split the cost as you have, and you would pay fair market rent each month half of which would come back to you. A third option would be to refinance the house, with you as a sole mortgage holder. To factor in how much your partner should receive out of the transaction, you can take hisher current equity and subtract half of the costs associated with the refi. I would also recommend both of you seek out the help of a real estate lawyer at this point to help you draft an agreement. It sounds like youre still on good terms, so you could see a lawyer together this would be helpful because they should know all the things you should look out for in a situation like this.

    "topic": "Why would anyone want to pay off their debts in a way other than highest interest first?",
    "content": "It is true that all else being equal, you will pay a lower amount of total interest by paying down your highest interest rate debts first. However, all else is not always equal. Im going to try to come up with some reasons why it might be better in some circumstances to pay your debts in a different order. And Ill try to use as much math as possible.  Lets say that your goal is to eliminate all of your debt as fast as possible. The faster you do this, the lower the total interest that you will pay. Now, lets consider the different methods that you could take to get there You could pay the highest interest first, you could pay the lowest interest first, or you could pay something in the middle first. No matter which path you choose, the quicker you pay everything off, the lower total interest you will pay. In addition to that, the quicker you pay everything off, the difference in total interest paid between the most optimal method and the least optimal method will be less. To put this in mathematical notation limt0  Interestt  0 Given that, anything we can do to speed up the time it takes to get to \"debt free\" is to our advantage. When paying large amounts of debt as fast as possible, sacrifice is needed. And this means that psychology comes into play. I dont know about you, but for me, gamifying the system makes everything easier. After all, gamification is what gets us to write answers here on SE. One way to do this is to eliminate individual debts as quickly as possible. For example, lets say that Ive got 10 debts. 5 of them are for 1k each. 3 of them are for 5k each, 1 is a 20k car loan, and 1 is a 100k mortgage. Each one has a monthly payment. Lets say that Ive got 3k sitting in the bank that I want to use to kickstart my debt reduction. I could pay all 3k toward one of my larger loans, or I could immediately pay off 3 of my 10 loans. Ignore interest for the moment, and lets say that we are going to pay off the smallest loans first. When I eliminate these three loans, three of my monthly payments are also gone. Now lets say that with the money I was paying toward these eliminated debts, and some other money I was able to scrape together 500 a month that I want to use toward debt reduction. In four months, Ive eliminated the last two 1k debts, and Im down to 5 debts instead of 10. Achievement Unlocked! Instead of this strategy, I could have paid toward my largest interest rate. Lets say that was one of the 5k loans. I paid the 3k toward the bank to it, and because I still had all the monthly payments after that, I was only able to scrape together 400 a month extra toward debt reduction. In four months, I still have 10 debts. Now lets say that after these four months, I have a bad month, and some unexpected expenses come up. If Ive eliminated 5 of my debts, my monthly payments are less, and Ill have an easier month then I would have had if I still had 10 monthly payments to deal with. Each time I eliminate a debt, the amount extra I have each month to tackle the remaining debts gets bigger. And if your goal is eliminating debt quickly, these early wins can really help motivate you on. It really feels like you are getting somewhere when your monthly bills go down. It also helps you with the debt free mindset. You start to see a future where you arent sending payments to the banks each month. This method of paying your smaller debts first has been popularized in recent years by Dave Ramsey, and he calls it the debt snowball method. There might be other reasons why you would pick one debt over another to pay first. For example, lets say that one of your loans is with a bank that has terrible customer service. They dont send you bills on time, they process your payment late, their website stinks, they are a constant source of stress, and you are getting sick of them. That would be a great reason to pay that debt first, and never set foot in that bank again. In conclusion If you have a constant amount of extra cash each month that you are going to use to reduce your debt, and this will never change, then, yes, you will save money over the long run by paying the highest interest debt first. However, if you are trying to eliminate your debt as fast as possible, and you are sacrificing in your budget, sending every extra penny you can scrape together toward debt reduction, the \"snowball\" method of knocking out the small debts first can help motivate you to continue to sacrifice toward your goal, and can also ease the cash flow situation in difficult months when you find yourself with less extra to send in."

If youre planning on having kids, then buy a home that will accommodate that. If youre not planning on living in the same place at least 6 years, then buying might not be the best idea, and certainly might not be the best \"investment\". Youre buying a home that will end up having emotional value to you. This isnt like buying a rental property or commercial real estate. Chances are you wont lose money in the long run, unless the market crashes again, but in that case everyone pretty much gets screwed so dont worry about it. Were not in a housing market like what existed in decades past. The idea of buying a home so that youll make money off it when you sell it isnt really as reliable a practice as it once was. Take advantage of the ridiculously low interest rates, but note that if you wait, theyre not likely to go up by an amount that will make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things. My family and I went through the exact same thought process youre going through right now. We close on our new house tomorrow. We battled over renting somewhere  we dont have a good rental market compared to buying here, buying something older for less money and fixing it up  were HGTV junkies but we realized we just dont have the time or emotional capacity to deal with that scenario, or buying newlike new. There are benefits and drawbacks to all 3 options, and we spent a long time weighing them and eventually came to a conclusion that was best for us. Go talk to a realtor in your area. Youre under no obligation to use them, but you can get a better feel for your options and what might best suit you by talking to a professional.

Moreover, you are ignoring the personal exemption and standard deduction. A gross salary of 72,000 is not the same as taxable income of 72,000. The deduction will generally be 12,200 and the exemptions will be 3,900 for you, your spouse, and any kids. So marriedfilingjointly with the standard deduction will get an automatic 20,000 off of adjusted gross income when counting taxable income. So the appropriate taxable income is actually going to be more like 52,000. Note that getting your compensation package reshuffled may result in different tax treatment. But simply taking a smaller salary rather than taking some compensation as stock options, health insurance, or fringe benefits, is not a moneysaving move. Never do it."

Its also generally safe to assert that card issuers currently dont receive or actively look at itemized transaction details. But that does not mean they cannot in the future. Some stores utilize level 3 data processing, which tells the card issuers exactly what you bought in a transaction. An example of level 3 data being utilized to reject rewards is with Discover, which announced a 10 cashback reward for any transactions made with Apple Pay last year. It later introduced an additional term to exclude gift card purchases. And this has been verified to be effective  no more reward on gift card purchases clawback of cashback on existing gift card transactions. As far as I know, Amex does receive and look at some level 3 data retrospectively. That does not necessarily mean they will claw back your cashback after initially rewarding the 6. But it might show up if you ever trigger an account review, and be used as evidence of your \"abuse\" of the program which BTW is defined rather subjectively. There has been many cases of account shutdowns because of this. Card issuers are also trying to do a better job preventing \"abuses\" by proactively setting caps on rewards as opposed to closing those accounts afterwards and taking the rewards away altogether. Given the trend in recent years, I have to speculate that at some point the card issuers would put clear language in the terms against gift card purchase and enforce it effectively if they havent already. This reward game is constantly changing. Its good while it lasts. Just be prepared and dont get surprised when things go south."

For example you could use candle stick reversal patterns on monthly charts, weekly charts, daily charts or intraday charts like one hour, or even one minute charts. Obviously if you are looking for longer term positions you would be looking at daily, weekly or monthly charts and if you are looking for shorter term positions you would be looking at intraday to daily charts. You can also use a combination of time frames  for example, if you are trying to enter a trade over a longterm uptrend you could use a weekly chart to determine if the stock is currently uptrending and then use a daily chart to time your entry into the trade. Most patterns in general dont really determine how long you will be in the trade but instead usually can provide an entry trigger, a stop loss location and possibly a profit target. So in general a pattern which is being used to enter into longer term trades on weekly charts can also be used to enter shorter term trades on intraday charts."

    "content": "The best strategy? Skip the loan. Find a way to invest for a low starting amount via a retirement account such as a 401K or IRA in the United States or nonretirement account. Use this money to buy individual stocks or funds. Every month put money from your regular income into this investment account. Then buy more stocks or sell if the conditions change based on what the market is doing, not to meet a loan payment. This helps you because if the price fluctuates you will buy more shares if the price is down and you will buy fewer shares when the price is up. It also allows you to skip worrying about how to repay the loan. It also means that you not have to pull more money out of savings to make the final loan payments if it doesnt make as much money as you plan. Regarding your math. This is a better understanding of the money flow than the earlier question."

    "topic": "How to find an optimum linear combination of various investments?",
    "content": "Youre talking about modern portfolio theory. The wiki article goes into the math. Heres the gist Modern portfolio theory MPT is a theory of finance that attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk, or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return, by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets. At the most basic level, you either a pick a level of risk standard deviation of your whole portfolio that youre ok with and find the maximum return you can achieve while not exceeding your risk level, or b pick a level of expected return that you want and minimize risk again, the standard deviation of your portfolio. You dont maximize both moments at once. The techniques behind actually solving them in all but the most trivial cases portfolios of two or three assets are trivial cases are basically quadratic programming because to be realistic, you might have a portfolio that a doesnt allow short sales for all instruments, andor b has some securities that cant be held in fractional amounts like ETFs or bonds. Then there isnt a closed form solution and you need computational techniques like mixed integer quadratic programming Plenty of firms and people use these techniques, even in their most basic form. Also your terms are a bit strange It has correlation table p11, p12, ... pij, pnn for i and j running from 1 to n This is usually called the covariance matrix. I want to maximize 2 variables. Namely the expected return and the additive inverse of the standard deviation of the mixed investments. Like I said above you dont maximize two moments return and inverse of risk. I realize that youre trying to minimize risk by maximizing \"negative risk\" so to speak but since risk and return are inherently a tradeoff you cant achieve the best of both worlds. Maybe I should point out that although the above sounds nice, and, theoretically, its sound, as one of the comments points out, its harder to apply in practice. For example its easy to calculate a covariance matrix between the returns of two or more assets, but in the simplest case of modern portfolio theory, the assumption is that those covariances dont change over your time horizon. Also coming up with a realistic measure of your level of risk can be tricky. For example you may be ok with a standard deviation of 20 in the positive direction but only be ok with a standard deviation of 5 in the negative direction. Basically in your head, the distribution of returns you want probably has negative skewness because on the whole you want more positive returns than negative returns. Like I said this can get complicated because then you start minimizing other forms of risk like value at risk, for example, and then modern portfolio theory doesnt necessarily give you closed form solutions anymore. Any actively managed fund that applies this in practice since obviously a completely passive fund will just replicate the index and not try to minimize risk or anything like that will probably be using something like the above, or at least something thats more complicated than the basic undergrad portfolio optimization that I talked about above. Well quickly get beyond what I know at this rate, so maybe I should stop there."

You would have to pay the car off first and obtain a clear title, then you could sell it. When you took out the loan, did you not receive a copy of the finance contract? I cant imagine you would have taken on a loan without signing paperwork and receiving your own copy at the time. If the company youre dealing with is the lender, they are obligated by law to furnish you with a copy of the finance contract all part of \"truth in lending\" laws upon request. It sounds to me like they know theyre charging you an illegally high called \"usury\" interest rate, and if you have a copy of the contract then you would have proof of it. Theyll do everything they can to prevent you from obtaining it, unless you have some help. I would start by filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, because if they want to keep their reputation intact then theyll have to respond to your complaint. I would also contact the state consumer protection bureau andor the attorney generals office in your state and ask them to look into the matter, and I would see if there are any local consumer watchdogs local television stations are a good source for this who can contact the lender on your behalf. Knowing they have so many people looking into this could bring enough pressure for them to give you what youre asking for and be more cooperative with you. As has been pointed out, keep a good, detailed written record of all your contacts with the lender and, as also pointed out, start limiting your contacts to written letters certified, return receipt requested so that you have documentation of your efforts. Companies like this succeed only because they prey on the fact many people either dont know their rights or are too intimidated to assert them. Dont let these guys bully you, and dont take \"no\" for an answer until you get what youre after.

After all, their main role when you use them is to negotiate payments with creditors so you can pay off your debts. In this case you have the funds to pay, so why make it any more complicated than it needs to be? To be honest, a 597 score is going to make it tough for you to find auto financing. Whatever options you find, theyll charge pretty steep interest rates and have high payments because theyll keep you on as short a payment term as your finances will allow. I would strongly suggest that you work on improving your score for awhile before trying to buy a car. If you can, buy a car for cash. You might not get much, but it will solve your transportation problem while you work on resolving your credit issues. Using a credit counselor wont have any impact on your credit score as far as the debts are concerned. What will make a difference is not having them show as open collections, which is pretty bad. Youll still take a hit for having gone to collections in the first place, but paying them off will mitigate at least some of the effect. I hope this helps. Good luck!"

See the added portion below regarding dealing with \"related person\" which a sibling is. The state of Maryland has a transferrecordation tax of 1.5 for each, the buyer and seller. Would this be computed on the appraised or sale value? You should check with the State. In California property taxes are assessed based on sale value, but if the sale value is bogus the assessors have the right to recalculate. Since youre selling to family, the assessors will likely to intervene and set a more close to \"fair market\" value on the transaction, but again  check the local law. Will this pose any problem if the buyer needs financing? Likely, banks will be suspicious.Since youre giving a discount to your sibling, it will likely not cause a problem for financing. If it was an unrelated person getting such a discount, it would likely to have raised some questions. Would I be able to deduct a capital loss on my tax return? As I said  it may be a problem. If the transaction is between related people  likely not. Otherwise  not sure. Check with a professional tax adviser EA or CPA licensed in Maryland. You mentioned in the comment that the buyer is a sibling. IRS Publication 544 has a list of what is considered \"related person\", and that includes siblings.

The characteristics that define a student loan are, primarily, that it is a loan that is intended to be used by someone who is currently a student. Beyond that, though, there are many variations. The different kinds of requirements usually have to do with who is eligible for the loan, and with what the loan is allowed to be used to pay. Some loans have other limitations, such as only being allowed to be directly paid to the institution. Some student loans are federally guaranteed meaning the Federal Government will repay the bank if you default. Those have a lower interest rate, typically, and often have more stringent requirements, such as only fulltime students being eligible, being needbased, and limitations on what the loans funds can be used for. See studentaid.ed.gov for more information. Many private student loans have quite lax limitations. Some for example have nearly no limitation as to what they can fund many are allowed to be taken out by parttime students and even nondegreeseeking students in some cases. Private loans usually have somewhat higher rates as theyre entirely unsecured to go along with the lower restrictions and higher borrowing limits. Youd have to see the specific details of any particular loan to know what its allowed to pay for, so if you choose this route, know what you plan to use it to pay for before you go looking."

You already have the statistical edge trading covered calls over everyone who purchased stock at the same point in time. This is because covered calls reduce your cost basis and increase your probability of profit. For people reading this who are not interested in the math behind probability of profitPOP for covered calls, you should be aware of why POP is higher for covered calls CC. With CCs you win when the stock price stays the same, you win when it goes down slightly, you win when the stock goes up. You have two more ways to win than someone who just buys stock, therefore a higher probability of making a buck! Another option If your stock is going to be called at a loss, or the strike you want to roll to results in a net debit, or your cash funds are short of owning 100x shares and you are familiar with the stock, try writing a naked put for the price you want to buy at. At experation, if the naked put is exercised, your basis is reduced by the premium of the put you sold, and you can write a covered call against the stock you now own. If it expires worthless you keep the premium. This is also another way to increase your POP."

When the Swiss franc appreciates, some companies suffer a lot from that and other less. It depends on their product portfolio, competitors, and other factors. The last decades have shown that how the Swiss Franc valuation is less and less correlated with the performance of the Swiss economy. The Swiss franc is used as a safe haven when the global economy goes bad or is uncertain. In those times, the Swiss franc can be overevaluated, at least as compared to the purchasing power. When the global economy is improving, the overappreciation of the Swiss franc tends to disapear  this is happening now in Mid2017.

    "content": "Specific stock advice isnt permitted on these boards. Im discussing the process of a call spread with the Apple Jan 13 calls as an example. In effect, you have 10 to bet. Each bet youd construct offers a different return odds. For example, If you bought the 750 call at 37.25, youd need to look to find what strike has a bid of 27 or higher. The 790 is bid 27.75. So this particular spread is a 4 to 1 bet the stock will close in January over 790, with a 760 break even. You can pull the number from Yahoo to a spreadsheet to make your own chart of spread costs, but Ill give one more example. You think it will go over 850, and that strike is now ask 18.85. The highest strike currently listed is 930, and its bid 10.35. So this spread cost is 850, and a close over 930 returns 8000 or over 9 to 1. Again, this is not advice, just an analysis of how spreads work. Note, any anomalies in the pricing above is the effect of a particular strike having no trades today, not every strike is active so last trade can be days old. Note My answer adds to AlexRs response in that once you used the word bet and showed a desire to make a risky move, options are the answer. You acknowledged you understand the basic concept, but given the contract size of 100 shares, these suggestions are ways to bet under your 1000 limit and profit from the gain in the underlying stock you hope to see."

    "topic": "Why does an option lose time value faster as it approaches expiry",
    "content": "This is because volatility is cumulative and with less time there is less cumulative volatility. The time value and option value are tied to the value of the underlying. The value of the underlying stock is quite influenced by volatility, the possible price movement in a given span of time. Thirty days of volatility has a much broader spread of values than two days, since each day benefits from the possible price change of the prior days. So if a stock could move up to  1 in a day, then compounded after 5 days it could be 5, 0, or 5. In other words, this is compounded volatility. Less time means far less volatility, which is geometric and not linear. Less volatility lowers the value of the underlying. See BlackScholes for more technical discussion of this concept. A shorter timeframe until option expiration means there are fewer days of compounded volatility. So the expected change in the underlying will decrease geometrically. The odds are good that the price at T5 days will be close to the price at T0, much more so than the prices at T30 or T90. Additionally, the time value of an American option is the implicit put value or implicit call. While an \"American\" option lets you exercise prior to expiry unlike a \"European\" option, exercised only at expiry, theres an implicit put option in a call or an implicit call in a put option. If you have an American call option of 60 days and it goes into the money at 30 days, you could exercise early. By contract, that stock is yours if you pay for it or, in a put, you can sell whenever you decide. In some cases, this may make sense if you want an immediate payoff or you expect this is the best price situation, but you may prefer to watch the price. If the price moves further, your gain when you use the call may be even better. If the price goes back out of the money, then you benefited from an implicit put. Its as though you exercised the option when it went in the money, then sold the stock and got back your cash when the stock went out of the money, even though no actual transaction took place and this is all just implicit. So the time value of an American option includes the implicit option to not use it early. The value of the implicit option also decreases in a nonlinear fashion, since the value of the implicit option is subject to the same valuation principles. But the larger principle for both is the compounded volatility, which drops geometrically."

An investor seeks to buy stocks at a low price, and sell when the price is high. Not necessarily. An investor will buy shares in a company that they believe will make them a profit. In general, a company will make a profit and distribute some or all of it to shareholders in the form of dividends. They will also keep back a portion of the profit to invest in growing the company. If the company does grow, it will grow in value and your shares will get more valuable. Price of a stock is affected by supplydemand, volume, and possibly company profits The price of a share that you see on a stock ticker is the price that people on the market have exchanged the share for recently, not the price you or I can buy a share for, although usually if people on the market are buying and selling at that price, someone will buy or sell from you at a similar sort of price. In theory, the price will be the companies total value, if you were to own the whole thing its market capitalisation divided by the total number of shares that exist in that company. The problem is that its very difficult to work out the total value of a company. You can start by counting the different things that it owns including things like intellectual property and the knowledge and experience of people who work there, subtract all the money it owes in loans etc., and then make an allowance for how much profit you expect the company to make in the future. The problem is that these numbers are all going to be estimates, and different peoples estimates will disagree. Some people dont bother to estimate at all. The market makers will just follow supply and demand. They will hold a few shares in each of many companies that they are interested in. They will advertise a lower price that they are willing to buy at and a higher price that they will sell at all the time. When they hold a lot of a share, they will price it lower so that people buy it from them. When they start to run out, they will price it higher. You will never need to spend more than the market makers price to buy a share, or get less than the market makers price when you come to sell it unless you want to buy or sell more shares than they are willing to. This is why stock price depends on supply and demand. The other category of people who dont care about the companies they are trading are the high speed traders. They just look at information like the past price, the volume total amount of shares being exchanged on the market and many other statistics both from the market and elsewhere and look for patterns. You cannot compete with these people  they do things like physically locate their servers nearer to the stock exchanges buildings to get a few milliseconds time advantage over their competitors to buy shares quicker than them."

    "content": "The Swiss franc has appreciated quite a bit recently against the Euro as the European Central Bank ECB continues to print money to buy government bonds issues by Greek, Portugal, Spain and now Italy. Some euro holders have flocked to the Swiss franc in an effort to preserve the savings from the massive Euro money printing. This has increased the value of the Swiss franc. In response, the Swiss National Bank SNB has tried to intervene multiple times in the currency market to keep the value of the Swiss franc low. It does this by printing Swiss francs and using the newly printed francs to buy Euros. The SNB interventions have failed to suppress the Swiss franc and its value has continued to rise. The SNB has finally said they will print whatever it takes to maintain a desired peg to the Euro. This had the desired effect of driving down the value of the franc. Which effect will this have long term for the euro zone? It is now clear that all major central bankers are in a currency devaluation war in which they are all trying to outprint each other. The SNB was the last central bank to join the printing party. I think this will lead to major inflation in all currencies as we have not seen the end of money printing. Will this worsen the European financial crisis or is this not an important factor? Im not sure this will have much affect on the ongoing European crisis since most of the European government debt is in euros. Should this announcement trigger any actions from common European people concerning their wealth? If a European is concerned with preserving their wealth I would think they would begin to start diverting some of their savings into a harder currency. Europeans have experienced rapidly depreciating currencies more than people on any other continent. I would think they would be the most experienced at preserving wealth from central bank shenanigans."

Apple hasnt released anything more than incremental upgrades to its existing product lines since Jobs passed, and while some people would argue about the Apple watch, Jobs played a significant role in its development prior to his death, so that doesnt really count. Whether you like or hate Apple, you had to admire Jobs passion and creativity, and theres real question as to whether the company can sustain its dominance in the market without the Jobs vision over the long haul. My guess is that the market is leaning slightly toward the \"no\" column, but only ever so slightly. The company continues to deliver fantastic results, but how long will that last of their next products dont wow consumers the way previous ones have? This skepticism manifests itself in a stock that trades at a lower PE than it deserves to, but this is just my opinion. I hope this helps. Good luck!"

    "topic": "Is it better to miss the dividend and buy the undervalued stock?",
    "content": "As yet another explanation of why it does not really matter, you can look at this from the valuation point of view. Stock price is the present value of its future cash flows be it free cash flow of the firm or dividends, depending on the model. Lets have a look at the dividends case. Imagine, the price of the stock is based on only three dividends streams 5 dollars each dividend to be paid today, in year 1, and in year 2. Each should be discounted back to today say, at 10, except todays dividend, since today is now. Once that dividend is paid, it is no longer in the stream of cash flows. So if we just delete that first 5 from the formula, the price will adjust itself down by the amount of the dividend to 8.68. NOTE that this is a very simple example, since in reality cash flows streams are arguably infinite and because there are many other factors affecting stock price. But simply for your understanding, this example should provide you with the reason simply from the valuation perspective."

    "topic": "Are Index Funds really as good as experts claim?",
    "content": "Two main points to answer this in my opinion. First, most people dont start with say half a million dollar to buy all the stocks they need in one shot but rather they accumulate this money gradually. So they must make many Buys in their lifetime. Similarly, most people dont need to withdraw all their investment in one day and shouldnt do this anyway as it cuts the time of investment. So there will be many Sells. Performing a single buy or sell per year is not efficient since it means you have lots of cash sitting doing nothing. So in this sense, low cost indexing lets you quickly invest your money and withdraw it when needed after say you retire without worrying about commission costs each time. The second and most important point to me to answer this is that we should make a very clear distinction between strategy and outcome. Todays stock prices and all the ups and downs of the market are just one possible outcome that materialized from a virtually uncountable number of possible outcomes. Its not too hard to imagine that tomorrow we hear all iPhones explode and Apple stock comes crashing down. Or that in a parallel universe Amazon never takes off and somehow Sears is the king of online commerce. Another item in the \"outcome\" category is your decisions as a human being of when to buy and sell. If that exploding iPhone event does occur, would you hold on to your stocks? Would you sell and cut your losses? Does the average person make the same decision if they had 1000 invested in Apple alone vs 1M? Index investing offers a low cost strategy that mitigates these uncertainties for the average person. Again here the key is the word \"average\". Picking a handful of the heavyweight stocks as you mention might give you better returns in 30 years, but it could just as easily give you worse. And the current data suggest the latter is more likely. \"Heavyweights\" come and go who were they 30 years ago? and just like how the other 450 companies may seem right now as dragging down the portfolio, just as easily a handful of them can emerge as the new heavyweights. Guaranteed? No. Possible? Yes. Jack Bogle is simply saying low cost indexing is one of the better strategies for the average person, given the data. But nowhere is it guaranteed that in this lifetime e.g. next 30 years will provide the best outcome. Berkshire on the other hand are in the business of chasing maximum outcomes mid or short term returns. Its two different concepts that shouldnt be mixed together in my opinion."

In case of an audit, youll have trouble convincing the IRS that it didnt happen. I suggest asking the clients not to do this to you, since it may cost you significant amounts to fight the IRS later on. In any case, you report on your tax return what you really got, not what the 1099 says. If you have two 1099s covering the same income  theres no legal obligation to report the income twice. You do not have to pay twice the tax just because you have stupid clients. But you may have troubles explaining it to the IRS, especially if youre dealing with cash in your business.

    "content": "Actually, youre missing the key feature of CDOs. Most CDOs use much to our economic misery, ultimately a system call tranching. To simplify this idea, Ill make a two tranch example. Suppose I buy mortgages covering a face value of 120,000,000. Because they are subprime, if I just put them in a pool and finance them with bonds, the rating will be lousy and most investors will shun them at least investors who are safety oriented. What I do is divide them into two tranches. One bond issue is for 100,000,000 and another for 20,000,000. The idea is that any defaulting mortgage comes out of the latter bond issue. Ill probably keep these bonds the lower tranch. Thus buyers of the first issue are safe unless defaults exceed 20,000,000. Then the rating agencies rate the first issue AAA and it gets snapped up by investors. In a strict sense it is overcollateralized, basically the entire 120,000,000 backs up the first bond issue. In reality, many CDOs had multiple tranches, with the lowest tranch being retained by the underwriters and the other tranches sold as bonds of various ratings."

    "content": "Buy and Hope is a common investment strategy. Its also one that will keep you poor. Instead of thinking about saving money to put against a credit card or line of credit using your own job and hardearned dollars, why not use someone elses money? If you have enough of a down payment for a property of your own, consider a duplex, triplex, or 4plex where you live in one of the units. Since you will be living there you only need 5 down as opposed to 20 down if you do not live there. This arrangement gives you a place to live while you have other people paying your mortgage and other debts. If done properly, you can find a place that is cashflow positive so you basically live rentfree. This all assumes you have a down payment and a bank that will work with you. Your best bet is to discuss your situation with a mortgage broker. They know all the rules, and which banks have the best deal for you. A mortgage broker works on your behalf and is paid by the lending institution, not you. There are various caveats with this strategy, and they all revolve around knowing what to do and how to execute the plan. I suggest Googling Robert Kiyosaki and reading \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" before taking this journey. He offers a number of free and paid seminars that teach people how to purchase real estate and make it pay. I have taken the free evening seminar and the 500 weekend seminar on how to purchase properties and make money with them.

Invest the 300K in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts. Depending on which company you work for that could include 401K Regular or Roth, deductible IRA, Roth IRA. The amount of money you can transfer is a function of the options they give you, how much they match, and the amount of income you earn. For the 401K you will invest from your paycheck, but pull an equal amount from the remainder of the 300K. If you are married you can use the same procedure for your spouses account. You current income funds any vacations or splurges, because you will not need to put additional funds into your retirement plan. By your late 30s the 300K will now be fully invested in retirement account. Unfortunately you cant touch much of it without paying penalties until you are closer to age 60. Each year before semiretirement, you will have to invest some of your salary into nonretirement accounts to cushion you between age 40 and age 60. Investstart a business Take a chunk of the 300K, and decide that in X years you will use it to start a small business. This chunk of money must be liquid and invested safely so that you can use it when you want to. You also dont want to invest it in investments that have a risk of loss. Take the remaining funds and invest it as described in the no small business section. You will completely convert funds to retirement funds earlier because of a smaller starting amount. Hopefully the small business creates enough income to allow you to continue to fund retirement or semiretirement. But it might not. Comment regarding 5 year \"rules\" Roth IRA you have to remain invested in the Roth IRA for 5 years otherwise your withdrawal is penalized.

Early on, the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies which made the DJIA at first, a simple arithmetic average. The present divisor, after many adjustments, is less than one meaning the index is larger than the sum of the prices of the components. That is DJIA  sump  d where p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the Dow Divisor. Events such as stock splits or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices. In these cases, in order to avoid discontinuity in the index, the Dow Divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide DJIA  sumpold  dold  sumpnew  dnew The Dow Divisor was 0.14602128057775 on December 24, 2015.[40] Presently, every 1 change in price in a particular stock within the average, equates to a 6.848 or 1  0.14602128057775 point movement.

    "topic": "Withdrawing cash from investment take money from underperforming fund?",
    "content": "Bob should treat both positions as incomplete, and explore a viewpoint which does a better job of separating value from volatility. So we should start by recognizing that what Bob is really doing is trading pieces of paper say Stocks from Fund 1 or Bonds from Fund 2, to pick historically volatile and nonvolatile instruments. for pieces of paper Greenbacks. In the end, this is a trade, and should always be thought of as such. Does Bob value his stocks more than his bonds? Then he should probably draw from Fund 2. If he values his bonds more, he should probably draw from Fund 1. However, both Bob and his financial adviser demonstrate an assumption that an instrument, whether stock bond or dollar bill, has some intrinsic value which may raise over time. The issue is whether its perceived value is a good measure of its actual value or not. From this perspective, we can see the stock Fund 1 as having an actual value that grows quickly 6.5  1.85  4.65, and the bond Fund 2 as having an actual value that grows slower 4.5  1.15  3.35. Now the perceived value of the stocks is highly volatile. The Chairman of the Fed sneezes and a high velocity trader drives a stock up or down at a rate that would give you whiplash. This perspective aligns with the brokers opinion. If the stocks are low, it means their perceived value is artificially low, and selling it would be a mistake because the market is perceiving those pieces of paper as being worth less than they actually are. In this case, Bob wins by keeping the stocks, and selling bonds, because the stocks are perceived as undervalued, and thus are worth keeping until perceptions change. On the other hand, consider the assumption we carefully slid into the argument without any fanfare the assumption that the actual value of the stock aligns with its historical value. \"Past performance does not predict future results.\" Its entirely possible that the actual value of the stocks is actually much lower than the historical value, and that it was the perceived value that was artificially higher. It may be continuing to do so... who knows how overvalued the perceived value actually was! In this case, Bob wins by keeping the bonds. In this case, the stocks may have \"underperformed\" to drive perceptions towards their actual value, and Bob has a great chance to get out from under this market. The reality is somewhere between them. The actual values are moving, and the perceived values are moving, and the world mixes them up enough to make Scratchers lottery tickets look like a decent investment instrument. So what can we do? Bobs broker has a smart idea, hes just not fully explaining it because it is unprofessional to do so. Historically speaking, Bobs who lost a bunch of money in the stock market are poor judges of where the stock market is going next arguably, you should be talking to the Joes who made a bunch of money. They might have more of a clue.. Humans are emotional beings, and we have an emotional instinct to cut ties when things start to go south. The market preys on emotional thinkers, happily giving them what they want in exchange for taking some of their money. Bobs broker is quoting a well recognized phrase that is a polite way of saying \"you are being emotional in your judgement, and here is a phrasing to suggest you should temper that judgement.\" Of course the broker may also not know what theyre doing! Ive seen arguments that they dont! Plenty of people listened to their brokers all the way to the great crash of 2008. Brokers are human too, they just put their emotions in different places. So now Bob has no clear voice to listen to. Sounds like a trap! However, there is a solution. Bob should think about more than just simple dollars. Bob should think about the rest of his life, and where he would like the risk to appear. If Bob draws from Fund 1 liquidating stocks, then Bob has made a choice to realize any losses or gains early... specifically now. He may win, he may lose. However, no matter what, he will have a less volatile portfolio, and thus he can rely on it more in the long run. If Bob draws from Fund 2 liquidating bonds instead, then Bob has made a choice not to realize any losses or gains right away. He may win, he may lose. However, whether he wins or loses will not be clear, perhaps until retirement when he needs to draw on that money, and finds Fund 1 is still underperforming, so he has to work a few more years before retirement. There is a magical assumption that the stock market will always continue rewarding risk takers, but no one has quite been able to prove it! Once Bob includes his life perspective in the mix, and doesnt look just at the cold hard dollars on the table, Bob can make a more educated decision. Just to throw more options on the table, Bob might rationally choose to do any one of a number of other options which are not extremes, in order to find a happy medium that best fits Bobs life needs  I intentionally chose to label Fund 1 as stocks and Fund 2 as bonds, even though this is a terribly crude assumption, because I feel those words have an emotional attachment associated to them which 1 and 2 simply do not. Given that part of the argument is that emotions play a part, it seemed reasonable to dig into underlying emotional biases as part of my wording. Feel free to replace words as you see fit to remove this bias if desired."

The description is vague enough, that you can probably still get the account despite being a single male with no apparent heirs to benefit, but it raises the question of why you are buying the insurance. Whole life policies require you to maintain a certain ratio of investment to premium payment and you will likely never be able access all of the money in the account for your own personal usage. Compare several policies from several brokers and companies. Read all the critical sources you can about the pitfalls and dangers of commissions, fees and taxes eating the benefits of your account. Verify that the insurance company you buy the policy from is financially stable after the market crash. You are paying a commission to pool your money into their investment fund, and if your insurer goes under, youll have to get a portion of your money possibly only the principle back from the state insurance commissioner.

You might think that he has, because he used to hold 100 and now he holds 75. However, the difference is that the company is worth more than was before the sale. So the value of his stake was unchanged immediately before and after the sale. Jack agrees to this because the company needs this additional capital in order to meet its potential. See \"Why is stock dilution legal?\" For further explanation and another example of this, see the question \"If a startup receives investment money, does the startup founderowner actually gain anything?\" Your other scenario, where Venturo purchases existing shares directly from Jack, is not practical in this situation. If Jack sells his existing shares, you are correct that the company does not gain any additional capital.

Since your net profit was less than 400, you do not need to file Schedule SE. From the IRS web site SelfEmployment Income It is a common misconception that if a taxpayer does not receive a Form 1099MISC or if the income is under 600 per payer, the income is not taxable. There is no minimum amount that a taxpayer may exclude from gross income. All income earned through the taxpayers business, as an independent contractor or from informal side jobs is selfemployment income, which is fully taxable and must be reported on Form 1040. Use Form 1040, Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business, or Form 1040, Schedule CEZ, Net Profit from Business Sole Proprietorship to report income and expenses. Taxpayers will also need to prepare Form 1040 Schedule SE for selfemployment taxes if the net profit exceeds 400 for a year. Do not report this income on Form 1040 Line 21 as Other Income. Independent contractors must report all income as taxable, even if it is less than 600. Even if the client does not issue a Form 1099MISC, the income, whatever the amount, is still reportable by the taxpayer."

Maybe you have a broker that can do the research for you, maybe your local university has one in their business school, maybe you know someone that works for a bankfinancial institution or some other type of news outlet. Part of the reason for the difference in ease of access to information is that bond markets are dominated by institutional investors. A 100 million bond issues might be 90 owned by 1020 investors banks, insurance cos, mutual funds, etc. that will hold the bonds to maturity and the bonds might trade a few times a monthyear. On the other hand a similar equity offering may have several hundred or thousand owners with daily trading, especially if its included in an active stock index.

Your 100 of cash for natural disasters is likely more than enough, and even that I wouldnt necessarily consider a vital thing in this day where even a major natural disaster probably isnt going to have too much impact on the financial sector outside of the immediate area that you should be exiting quickly. Keep however much cash around that you need for day to day cash expenses, and that should be enough. The level of emergency that would suggest cash being needed would probably need more than youd actually want to keep around, anyway  i.e., a complete collapse of the American or World financial system would imply you need months worth of cash. Thats just not feasible, nor is it practical financially. You should have your emergency fund making at least a bit of interest  1 or so isnt hard to get right now, and in the near future that may increase substantially if interest rates go up. It also would make you a substantial theft target if it were known you had months worth of cash around the house i.e., thousands of dollars. Safes dont necessarily give you sufficient protection unless youve got a very good safe  commercial ones are only as safe as the ability to crack them andor transport them is.

Typically, after two to three month, they reevaluate your credit limit, and it could go up considerably if you never overdrew and at this time, it could indirectly positively affect your credit rating. You could consider calling the issuing bank after two month and try to explain the history a bit and get them to increase the limit, but that only makes sense if your credit score has recovered.

From another point of view, though, I would probably take a loan anyway just from a security standpoint  you have more risk if you put a third of your retirement savings into one purchase directly, whereas if you do a 1015 year loan, youll have more of a cushion. Also, if you dont outlive the mortgage, youll have had use of more of your retirement income than otherwise  though I do wonder if it puts you at some risk if you have significant medical bills which might require you to liquidate your 403b but wouldnt require you to sell your house, so paying it off has some upside. Also, as chili555 notes in comments, you should consider the taxation of your 403b income. If you pull it out in one lump sum, some of it may be taxed at a higher rate than if you pulled it out more slowly over time, which will easily overwhelm any interest rate differences.

It was much harder and slower to buy the local shares of Telmex in Mexico, on the Mexican exchange.

In either case you the sellside take on risk and provide productssecuritiescash. This is most commonly known as market making. Modern literature coins the terms liquidity taker buyside and liquidity provider sellside. Even more accurately, risk management literature would use the terms risktaker sellside and risk spreader or risk reducer buy side. This is quite illustrative in modern abstract markets. Take a market that allows for no offsetting or hedging because the product in question is abstract or theoretical, e.g. weather trading, volatility trading, inflation trading, etc. Theres always one party trying to eliminate dependence on or correlation to the product the risk reducer, buyside and the counterparty taking on their risk sellside."

Noise cancelling headphones certainly count as \"appropriate and helpful to your business\" in the software industry, especially with the trend of open office layouts. And because of the ubiquitous distractions inherent in the aforementioned office space, noise cancelling headphones are becoming quite \"common and accepted\" for use by developers. Id be more hesitant about the keyboard and monitor, as presumably the employer is providing those already. As using your own could be said to just be a personal preference over those provided, the argument that providing your own version is \"appropriate and helpful\" is a little more shaky.

This payment for your NSOs is exactly like a cash bonus. The withholding follows the same guidelines.

    "content": "Most businesses want to grow, and there are a variety of ways to raise the money needed to hire new employees and otherwise invest in the business to increase the rate of that growth. You as a stock holder should hope that management is choosing the least expensive option for growth. Some of the options are debt, selling equity to venture capitalists, or selling equity on the open market going public. If they choose debt, they pay interest on that debt. If they choose to sell equity to venture capitalists, then your shares get diluted, but hopefully the growth makes up for some of that dilution. If they choose to go public, dilution is still a concern, but the terms are usually a little more favorable for the company selling because the market is so liquid. In the US, current regulations for publicly traded companies cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 1Myear, so thats the rule of thumb for considering whether going public makes sense when calculating the cost of fundraising, but as mentioned, regulations make it less advantageous for executives who choose to sell their shares after the company goes public. They cant sell when good spot prices appear. Going public is often considered the next step for a company that has grown past the initial venture funding phase, but if cashflow is good, plenty of companies decide to just reinvest profits and skip the equity markets altogether."

Im going to start by trying to answer this question and I think the answer here will help answer the other questions. Here is a incomplete list of the challenges involved So my question is, is there any evidence that value investing actually beats the market? Yes there is a lot of evidence that it works and there is a lot of evidence that it does not. timdays has a great link on this. Some rulesmethods work over some periods some work during others. The most famous evidence for value investing probably comes from Fama and French who were very careful and clever in solving many of the above problems and had a large persistent data set, but their idea is very different from Damodarans, for instance, and hard to implement though getting easier. Is the whole field a waste of time? Because of the above problems this is a hard question. Some people like Warren Buffet have clearly made a lot of money doing this. Though it is worth remembering a good amount of the money these famous investors make is off of fees for investing other peoples money. If you understand fundamental analysis well you can get a job making a lot of money doing it for a company investing other peoples money. The markets are very random that it is very hard for people to tell if you are good at it and since markets generally go up it is easy to claim you are making money for people, but clearly banks and hedge funds see significant value in good analysts so it is likely not entirely random. Especially if you are a good writer you can make a more money here than most other jobs. Is it worth it for the average investor saving for retirement? Very, very hard to say. Your time might be better spent on your day job if you have one. Remember because of the fees and added risk involved over say index investing more \"Trading is Hazardous to Your Wealth.\""

You can \"explain\" every dollar entering and exiting the account without having to remember that some of them were for nonbusiness items. My credit union allowed me to have a 2nd checking account and allowed me to put whatever I wanted as the name on the check. I think this looked a little better than having my name on the check. I dont see the need for a separate checking account for investing. The money can be kept in a separate savings account that has no fees, and can even earn a little interest. Unless you are doing a lot of investment transactions a month this has worked for me. I fund IRAs and 529 plans this way. We get paychecks 45 times a month, but send money to each of the funds once a month. You will need a business account if the number of transactions becomes large. If you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank, the bank will want to move you to a business account."

So lets consider some numbers Im assuming you have the money to buy the new car available as cash in hand, and that if you dont buy the car, youll invest it reasonably. So if you buy the new car today, youre 17K out of pocket. Lets look at some scenarios and compare. Assuming If you buy the new car today, then after 1 year youll have If you keep the old car, after 1 year you get After 2 years, you have And after 3 years, youre at Or in other words, nothing depletes the value of your assets faster than buying the new car. After 1 year, youve essentially lost 5K to depreciation. However, over the short term the immediate cost of the tires combined with the continued depreciation of the old car do reduce your purchasing power somewhat you wont be able to muster 25K towards a new car without chipping in a bit of extra cash, and inflation will tend to drive the cost of the new car up as time goes on. So the relative gap between the value of your assets and the cost of the new car tends to increase, though it stays well below the 5k that you lose to depreciation if you buy the new car immediately. Which is something that you could potentially spin to support whichever side you prefer, I suppose. Though note that Ive made some fairly pessimistic assumptions. In particular, the current U.S. inflation rate is under 1, and a new car may depreciate by as much as 25 in the first year while older cars may depreciate by less than the 8 assumed. And I selected the cheapest new car price cited, and didnt credit the tires with adding any value to your old car. Each of those aspects tends to make continuing to drive the older car a better option than buying the new one."

But if you work in a highly cyclical industry, have very little cash saved, or for whatever other reason are uncertain about your future ability to pay, then dont borrow.

    "topic": "If a startup can always issue new shares, what value is there to stocksoptions?",
    "content": "The short answer, probably not much. Unless you have a controlling interest in the company. If at least 501 of the shareholder votes are in favor of the dilution then it can be done. There are some SEC rules that should protect against corporate looting and theft like what the Severin side is trying to make it appear as happened. However it would appear that Severin did something stupid. He signed away all of his voting right to someone who would use them to make his rights basically worthless. Had he kept his head in the game he could probably have saved himself. But he didnt. If your average startup started issuing lots of stock and devaluing existing shares significantly then I would expect it would be harder to find investors willing to watch as their investment dwindled. But if you are issuing a limited amount stock to get leverage to grow bigger then it is worth it. In the .com bubble there were quite a few companies that just issued stock to buy other companies. Eventually most of these companies got delisted because they diluted them selves to much when they were overvalued. Any company not just a startup can dilute its shares. Many if not most major companies issue stock to raise capital. This capital is then generally used to build the business further and increase the value of all shares. Most of the time this dilution is very minor .1 and has little if any impact on the stock. There are rules that have to be followed as listed companies are regulated by the SEC. There are less regulations with private corporations. It looks like the dilution was combined with the buyout of the Florida company which probably contributed to the legality of the dilution. With options they are generally issued at a set price. This may be higher or lower than the reported sell price of the stock when the option is issued. The idea is over time the stock will increase in value so that those people who hold on to their options can buy the stock for the price listed on the option. I worked at an ISP start up in the 90s that made it pretty well. I left before the options were issued but I had friends still there that were issued an option at 16 a share the value of the stock at the time of the issue of the option was about 12. Well the company diluted the shares and used them to acquire more ISPs unfortunately this was about the time that DSL And cable internet took off so the dial up market tanked. The value eventually fell to .10 they did a reverse split and when they did the called in all options. The options did not have a positive cash value at any time. Had RMI ever made it big then the options could have been worth millions. There are some people from MS and Yahoo that were in early that made millions off of their options. This became a popular way for startups to attract great talent paying peanuts. They invested their time in the business hoping to strike gold. A lot of IT people got burned so this is less popular among top talent as the primary compensation anymore."

    "content": "In the US, a private company with less than 500 owners can dictate who can or cant become a shareholder this is true in general, but Im sure there are loopholes. Prior to Googles IPO I could not buy shares in Google at any price. The reason Google was \"forced\" to go public is the 500 shareholder rule. At a high level, with 500 shareholders the company is forced to do some extra financial accounting and they no longer can control who owns a share of the company, allowing me to purchase shares of google at that point. At that point, it typically becomes in the companies best interest to go public. See this article about Google approaching the 500 shareholder limit in 2003. Further, Sorkin is not quite correct that \"securities laws mandate that the company go public\" if by \"go public\" we mean list on a stock exchange, available for general purchase. Securities laws mandate what has to be reported in financial reporting and when you have to report it. Securities laws also can dictate restrictions on ownership of stock and if a company can impose their own restrictions. A group of investors cannot force a company onto a stock exchange. If shares of Facebook are already for sale to anyone, then having 500 shareholders will force Facebook to file more paperwork with the SEC, it wont force Facebook onto the NYSE or NASDAQ. When that point is reached, it may be in Facebooks best interest to have an IPO, but they will not be required by law to do so. Update CNN article discusses likely Facebook IPO in 2012. When companies have more than 500 shareholders, theyre required to make significant financial disclosures  though they can choose to remain private and keep their stock from trading publicly. However, most companies facing mandatory disclosures opt to go public. The Securities and Exchange Commission gives businesses lots of time to prepare for that milestone. Companies have until 120 days after the end of the fiscal year in which they cross the 500shareholder line to begin making their disclosures. If Facebook tips the scale this year, that gives it until April 2012 to start filing financial reports."

    "topic": "How much can I withdraw from Betterment and be considered longterm investment?",
    "content": "This question and your other one indicate youre a bit unclear on how capital gains taxes work, so heres the deal you buy an asset like shares of stock or a mutual fund. You later sell it for more than you bought it for. You pay taxes on your profit the difference between what you sold it for and what you bought it for. What matters is not the amount of money you \"withdraw\", but the prices at which assets are bought and sold. In fact, often you will be able to choose which individual shares you sell, which means you have some control over the tax you pay. For a simple example, suppose you buy 10 shares of stock for 100 each in January an investment of 1000 well call these the \"early\" shares. The stock goes up to 200 in July, and you buy 10 more shares investing an additional 2000 well call these the \"late\" shares. Then the stock drops to 150. Suppose you want 1500 in cash, so you are going to sell 10 shares. The 10 early shares you bought have increased in value, because you bought then for 100 but can now sell them for 150. The 10 late shares have decreased in value, because you bought them for 200 but can now only sell them for 150. If you choose to sell the early shares, you will have a capital gain of 500 1500 sale price minus 1000 purchase price, on which you may owe taxes. If you sell the late shares, you will have a capital loss of 500 1500 sale price minus 2000 purchase price is 500, which you can potentially use to reduce your taxes. Or you could sell 5 of each and have no gain or loss selling five early shares for 150 gives you a gain of 250, but selling five late shares for 150 gives you a loss of 250, and they cancel out. The point of all this is to say that the tax is not determined by the amount of cash you get, but by the difference between the sale price and the price you purchased for known as the \"cost basis\", and this in turn depends on which specific assets you sell. It is not enough to know the total amount you invested and the total gain. You need to know the specific cost basis i.e., original purchase price of the specific shares youre selling. This is also the answer to your question about longterm versus shortterm gains. It doesnt matter how much money you make on the sale. What matters is how long you hold the asset before selling it. That said, many brokers will automatically sell your shares in a certain order unless you tell them otherwise and some wont let you tell them otherwise. Often they will use the \"first in, first out\" rule, which means they will always sell the earliestpurchased shares first. To finally get to your specific question about Betterment, they have a page here that says they use a different method. Essentially, they try to sell your shares in a way that minimizes taxes. They do this by first selling shares that have a loss, and only then selling shares that have a gain. This basically means that if you want to cash out X, and it is possible to do it in a way that incurs no tax liability, they will do that. What gets me very confused is if I continue to invest random amounts of money each month using Betterment, then I need to withdraw some cash, what are the tax implications. As my long answer above should indicate, there is no simple answer to this. The answer is \"it depends\". It depends on exactly when you bought the shares, exactly how much you paid for them, exactly when and how much the price rose or fell, and exactly how much you sell them for. Betterment is more or less saying \"Dont worry about any of this, trust us, we will handle everything so that your tax is minimized.\" A final note if you really do want to track the details of your cost basis, Betterment may not be for you, because it is an automated platform that may do a lot of individual trades that a human wouldnt do, and that can make tracking the cost basis yourself very difficult. Almost the whole point of something like Betterment is that you are supposed to give them your money and forget about these details."

I identify this fund because I know it exists, not because I particularly recommend it. Your money will be in Canadian currency earning Canadian interest rates. You will pay a small portion of that interest in fees. Since US banks are already guaranteed by the FDIC up to 250,000 per account, I dont really think you avoid any risks associated with the failure of an individual bank, but you might fare better if the US currency is subject to inflation or unfavorable foreignexchange movements  not that such a thing would be a direct risk of a bank failure, but it could happen as a result of actions taken by the Federal Reserve under the auspices of aiding the economy if the economy worsens in the wake of a financial crisis  or, for that matter, if it worsens as a result of something else, including legislative, regulatory, or executive policies. Read the prospectus to understand additional risks with this investment. One of them is foreignexchange risk. If the US economy and currency strengthen relative to the Canadian economy and its currency, you may lose substantial amounts of purchasing power. Additionally, one of the possible results of a financial crisis is a \"flight to safety\" the global financial markets still seem to think the US dollar is pretty safe, and they may bid it up as they have done in the past, resulting in losses to your position at least in the short term. I do not personally recommend moving all your savings to Canada, especially if it deprives you of income from more profitable investments over the long term, but moving some of your savings to Canada at least isnt a stupid idea, and it may turn out to be somewhat profitable. Having some Canadian currency is also a good idea if you plan to spend the money that you are saving on Canadian goods in the intermediate future."

In any case its setting off my too good to be true alarm at full volume, along with the shark attack alarm as well. I would strongly suspect the advisor is advising the product that makes the most money for him, NOT what is in your mothers best interest A fixed annuity is an insurance product, not a security, because the insurance company must credit the annuity holders account with the specified interest rate for the contractuallystipulated time period, regardless of market fluctuations in actual interest rates. It is the insurance company that bears the investment risk, which it does by investing the annuity holders purchase proceeds in fixedincome instruments that the company hopes will provide sufficient return to fulfill its contractual representations to the holder. THIS is why there is no prospectus its not a security they are not required to provide one by SEC because the risk is entirely with the company. Obviously as pointed out in the comments, the company could easily go out of business especially of they sell a lot of these and cant find a way to get that kind of return on the invested money. Now, ask yourself, if I was the insurance company, would I be comfortable guaranteeing that level of return over that much time if I intend to make a profit from it, pay sales comissions, and stay in business? In terms of will they stay in business Id have a hard look at their ratings, and go compare where that is on the total range for AM Best they are lowest secure rating, next thing down is in the vulnerable category and Standard and Poors 4 places down from their best rating, next thing down is marginal followed by poor You might also want to see if you can get any idea of historical ratings, is this companys ratings falling, or rising? Personally, for the amount of money involved, Id want a company with MUCH higher ratings than these guys.. THEN maybe someone could say no risk, but with those ratings? an no, I dont think so!

In my experience, hospitals have a financial assistance program you can apply for. If you can show a financial need, the hospital will only charge you a certain percentage of your bill. A person with a very low income will likely only be charged 5 or 10 of the theoretical balance. That would be assuming the person is at or near the poverty level which has an official definition  but to give you an idea, your cashier at McDonalds is probably at or near the poverty level. Also note that sometimes it takes a while for hospital charges to be submitted to insurance, and to be approved and paid. Thus, many people have learned through experience to ignore the first bill that comes in from a hospital, and wait a month before paying. There can be a dramatic drop in the \"What you owe\" line after the insurance company responds, and the billing office adjusts the bill to the negotiated amount and subtracts off what the insurance company covered."

    "content": "The \"guaranteed minimum future value\" isnt really a guarantee so much as the amount they will charge you at the end of the agreement if you want to keep the car. In this sense it might better be considered a \"guaranteed maximum future cost\". If the car has fallen below that value at that point, then you can just hand back the car and you wont owe anything extra. If it turns out to be worth more, you end up in profit  though only if you either actually pay for the car, or if you roll over into a new PCP deal. So the finance company has an incentive to set it at a sensible value, otherwise theyll end up losing money. Most new cars lose a lot of value quickly initially, and then the rate of loss slows down. But given that its lost 14k in 2 years, it seems pretty likely itll lose much more than another 1k in the next 2 years. So it does sound like that in this case, they estimated the value badly at the start of the deal and will end up taking a loss on the deal when you hand it back at the end. It appears you also have the legal right to \"voluntary termination\" once you have paid off half the \"Total Amount Payable\". This should be documented in the PCP agreement and if youre half way into the deal then Id expect youll be about there. If that doesnt apply, you can try to negotiate to get out of the deal early anyway. If they look at it rationally, they should think about the value of your payments over the next two years minus the loss they will end up with at the end of those two years. But theres no guarantee they will.

    "content": "The fundamental flaw here is conflating net worth with utility, at least failing to recognize that theres a nonlinear relationship between the two. In the extreme example imagine taking a bet that will either make you twice as rich or completely broke. Your expected return is zero, but it would be pretty dumb to take it since being flat broke could ruin your life while being twice as rich may only improve it marginally. In more realistic cases most of your income is tied up in fixed costs, which magnifies relatively small perturbations to your net worth. Losing something essential like your house or car, even if its only 20 of your net worth, renders you effectively broke until you scrape together enough cash to get another one. That situation robs you of much more utility than youd gain from a 20 increase in net worth. In either case, avoiding the risk is completely rational as long as you believe in nonlinear utility as a function of net worth, its not just an issue of humans being \"risk averse\"."

    "content": "the average person doesnt care nor are they affected by how much their employer spends in healthcare It may be true that the average person doesnt care how much their employer spends on healthcare, but its not true that we arent affected. From an employers perspective, healthcare, wages, and all other benefits are part of the cost of having an employee. When healthcare goes up, it increases the total employee cost. Employers can handle this in several ways. They could reduce the amount they give investors as dividends, stock buybacks, etc.. But then the stock is worth less and they have to make up the money somewhere else. They could pass the expense on to customers. But then the loss in business can easily cost more than the revenue raised. They can cut wages or other benefits. Then the average person will start caring...and might get a different job. I found this article saying that 12M households spend 50 of income on rent, so Im assuming that an even greater number spend more than the recommended 30, which means rent should be weighted as high as it is in CPI. According to the census, thats only about 10 of households. It also notes that 64.4 of households are owneroccupied. They dont pay rent. The CPI makes up a number called owners equivalent rent for those households to get to the higher percentage. The CPI is intended for things like wages. This makes it a good choice for a cost of living adjustment, but it doesnt quite represent the overall economy. And for investments, its the broader economy that matters. Household consumption is less important. What the Fed says."

    "content": "Rebalancing your portfolio doesnt have to include selling. You could simply adjust your buying to keep your portfolio in balance. If you portfolio has shifted from 50 stocks and 50 bonds to 75 stocks and 25 bonds, you can just only use new savings to buy bonds, until you are back at 5050. Remember to take into account taxes if you are thinking of selling to rebalance in taxable accounts. The goal of rebalancing is to keep your exposures the way that you want them. Assuming that you had a good reason to have a portfolio of 50 stocks and 50 bonds, you probably want to keep your portfolio similar in the future. If you end up with a portfolio of 75 stocks and 25 bonds due to stock market fluctuations, the exposure and the risk  return profile of your portfolio will have changed, and its probably not something that you want. You dont want to rebalance just for the sake of rebalancing either. There can be costs to rebalancing taxes, transaction fees, etc... and these arent always worth the effort. Thats why you dont need to rebalance every month or if your portfolio has shifted from 5050 to 5149.

    "content": "I separate them out, simply because theyre for different purposes, with different goals and timeframes, and combining them may mask hidden problems in either the retirement account or the regular account. Consider an example A young investor has been working on their retirement planning for a few years now, and has a modest amount of retirement savings say 15,000 allocated carefully according to one of the usually recommended schemes. A majority exposure to large cap U.S. stocks, with smaller exposures to small cap, international and bond markets. Years before however, they mad an essentially emotional investment in a struggling manufacturer of niche personal computers, which then enjoyed something of a renaissance and a staggering growth in shareholder value. Lets say their current holdings in this company now represent 50,000. Combining them, their portfolio is dominated by large cap U.S. equities to such an extent that the only way to rebalance their portfolio is to pour money into bonds and the international market for years on end. This utterly changes the risk profile of their retirement account. At the same time, if we switch the account balances, the investor might be reassured that their asset allocation is fine and diversified, even though the assets they have access to before retirement are entirely in a single risky stock. In neither case is the investor well served by combining their funds when figuring out their allocation  especially as the \"goal\" allocations may very well be different."

On settlement date, lets assume two different scenarios 1 If the price of the stock decreases by 50, then the put that Abby bought is in the money. Abbys profit can be calculated as being strike price 190  current stock price 150  premium paid 5  35 So not including any transaction fees, that is a 35 dollar return on a 5 investment. 2 If the price of the stock increases by 50, then the put that Abby bought is worthless and her loss was 100, or her entire 5 premium.

    "content": "The T3 \"rule\" relates only to accounting and not to trading. It does not prevent you from day trading. It simply means that the postings in you cash account will not appear until three business days after you have executed a trade. When you execute a trade and the order has been filled, you have all of the information you need to know the cash amounts that will hit your account three business days later. In a cash account, cash postings that arise from trading are treated as unsettled for three days, but this does not mean that these funds are available for further trading. If you have 25,000 in your account on day 1, this does not mean that you will be able to trade more than 25,000 because your cash account has not yet been debited. Most cash accounts will include an item detailing \"Cash available for trading\". This will net out any unsettled business transacted. For example, if you have a cash account balance of 25,000 on day one, and on the same day you purchase 10,000 worth of shares, then pending settlement in your cash account you will only have 15,000 \"Cash available for trading\". Similarly, if you have a cash balance of 25,000 on day one, and on the same day you \"day trade\", purchasing 15,000 and selling 10,000 worth of shares, then you will have the net of 20,000 \"Cash available for trading\" 20,000  25,000  15,000  10,000. If by \"prop account\" you mean an account where you give discretion to a broker to trade on your behalf, then I think the issues of accounting will be the least of your worries.

    "topic": "Options for the intelligent but inexperienced",
    "content": "Some thoughts on your questions in order, Duration You might want to look at the longestdated option often a \"LEAP\", for a couple reasons. One is that transaction costs spread plus commission, especially spread are killer on options, so a longer option means fewer transactions, since you dont have to keep rolling the option. Two is that any fundamentalsbased views on stocks might tend to require 35 years to relatively reliably work out, so if youre a fundamental investor, a 36 month option isnt great. Over 36 months, momentum, shortterm news, short squeezes, etc. can often dominate fundamentals in determining the price. One exception is if you just want to hedge a shortterm event, such as a pending announcement on drug approval or something, and then you would buy the shortest option that still expires after the event but options are usually superexpensive when they span an event like this. Strike Strike price on a long option can be thought of as a tradeoff between the max loss and minimizing \"insurance costs.\" That is, if you buy a deeply inthemoney put or call, the time value will be minimal and thus you arent paying so much for \"insurance,\" but you may have 13 or 12 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss. If you buy a put or call \"at the money,\" then you might have only say 10 of the value of the underlying tied up in the option and subject to loss, but almost the whole 10 may be time value insurance cost, so you are losing 10 if the underlying stock price stays flat. I think of the deep inthemoney options as similar to buying stocks on margin but the \"implied\" interest costs may be less than consumer margin borrowing rates, and for long options you cant get a margin call. The atthemoney options are more like buying insurance, and its expensive. The commissions and spreads add significant cost, on top of the natural time value cost of the option. The annual costs would generally exceed the longrun average return on a diversified stock fund, which is daunting. Undervaluedovervalued options, pt. 1 First thing is to be sure the options prices on a given underlying make sense at all there are things that \"should\" hold, for example a synthetic long or short should match up to an actual long or short. These kinds of rules can break, for example on LinkedIn LNKD after its IPO, when shorting was not permitted, the synthetic long was quite a bit cheaper than a real long. Usually though this happens because the arbitrage is not practical. For example on LNKD, the shares to short werent really available, so people doing synthetic shorts with options were driving up the price of the synthetic short and down the price of the synthetic long. If you did actually want to be long the stock, then the synthetic long was a great deal. However, a riskless arbitrage buy synthetic long, short the stock was not possible, and thats why the prices were messed up. Another basic relationship that should hold is putcall parity httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPutE28093callparity Undervaluedovervalued options, pt. 2 Assuming the relationship to the underlying is sane synthetic positions equivalent to actual positions then the valuation of the option could focus on volatility. That is, the time value of the option implies the stock will move a certain amount. If the time value is high and you think the stock wont move much, you might short the option, while if the time value is low and you think the stock will move a lot, you might buy the option. You can get implied volatility from your broker perhaps, or Morningstar.com for example has a bunch of data on option prices and the implied components of the price model. I dont know how useful this really is though. The spreads on options are so wide that making money on predicting volatility better than the market is pretty darn hard. That is, the spread probably exceeds the amount of the mispricing. The price of the underlying is more important to the value of an option than the assumed volatility. How many contracts Each contract is 100 shares, so you just match that up. If you want to hedge 100 shares, buy one contract. To get the notional value of the underlying multiply by 100. So say you buy a call for 30, and the stock is trading at 100, then you have a call on 100 shares which are currently priced at 10,000 and the option will cost 301003,000. You are leveraged about 3 to 1. This points to an issue with options for individual investors, which is that one contract is a pretty large notional value relative to most portfolios."

If the lender charges interest and the borrower pays off the loan early then the lender loses the interest that would have been paid during the rest of the loan period. However if the actual interest is baked into the sale price of an item and the loan to pay for it is nominally \"0\" then the borrower still pays all the interest even if they pay off the loan immediately. If you think this game is being played then you can ask for a \"cash discount\" or similar wording I once had problems with a car salesman who thought I meant a suitcase full of used 20s, meaning you want to avoid paying the interest as you are not taking a loan."

    "content": "A general rule of thumb is to avoid having more than 5 of your investments in any single stock, to avoid excessive risk its usually even more risky if youre talking company stock because an adverse event could result in an inferior stock price and you getting laid off. Under other circumstances, the ideal amount of company stock is probably 0. But there are tax benefits to waiting, as youve noted, and if youre reasonably confident that the stock isnt likely to jerk around too much, and you have a high risk tolerance i.e. lots of extra savings besides this, and youre comfortable shouldering the risk of losing some money, it might make sense to hold onto the stock for a year  but never any longer. The real risk to holding a lot of company stock doesnt depend on how often you buy it and sell it per se, but having period purchases every month should make it easier for you to ladder the funds, and regularly sell your old shares as you purchase new shares. You might also consider a stoploss order on the stock at or near the price you purchased it at. If the stock is at 100, then you buy at 85, and then the stock drops to 85, there are no more outstanding tax benefits and it makes no sense to have it as part of your portfolio instead of any other speculative instrument  you probably get better diversification benefits with any other speculative instrument, so your riskadjusted returns would be higher."

Making you have an account helps ensure that, in the event they do test it and it fails, that a they know who you are in case the Secret Service wants to find you, and b they can recover their losses by debiting your account by the 100.

    "topic": "When an investor makes money on a short, who loses the money?",
    "content": "The correct answer to this question is the person who the short sells the stock to. Heres why this is the case. Say we have A, who owns the stock and lends it to B, who then sells it short to C. After this the price drops and B buys the stock back from D and returns it to A. The outcome for A is neutral. Typically stock that is sold short must be held in a margin account the broker can borrow the shares from A, collect interest from B, and A has no idea this is going on, because the shares are held in a street name the brokerages name and not A. If A decides during this period to sell, the transaction will occur immediately, and the brokerage must shuffle things around so the shares can be delivered. If this is going to be difficult then the cost for borrowing shares becomes very high. The outcome for B is obviously a profit they sold high first and bought back low afterwards. This leaves either C or D as having lost this money. Why isnt it D? One way of looking at this is that the profit to B comes from the difference in the price from selling to C and buying from D. D is sitting on the low end, and thus is not paying out the profit. D bought low, compared to C and this did not lose any money, so C is the only remaining choice. Another way of looking at it is that C actually \"lost\" all the money when purchasing the stock. After all, all the money went directly from C to B. In return, C got some stock with the hope that in the future C could sell it for more than was paid for it. But C literally gave the money to B, so how could anybody else \"pay\" the loss? Another way of looking at it is that C buys a stock which then decreases in value. C is thus now sitting on a loss. The fact that it is currently only a paper loss makes this less obvious if the stock were to recover to the price C bought at, one might conclude that C did not lose the money to B. However, in this same scenario, D also makes money that C could have made had C bought at Ds price, proving that C really did lose the money to B. The final way of seeing that the answer is C is to consider what happens when somebody sells a stock which they already hold but the price goes up who did they lose out on the gain to? The person again is who bought their stock. The person would buys the stock is always the person who the gain goes to when the price appreciates, or the loss comes out of if the price falls."

    "content": "The answer depends entirely on your mortgage terms  is the interest rate low, how many years left? Questions like this are about Cost of Capital. If your mortgage has a low interest for a lot of years, you have a low cost of capital. By paying it off early, you are dumping that low cost of capital. Use the extra money to start a business, invest in something or even buy another property rental. Whenever you have a low cost of capital, dont rush to get rid of it. Of course, if there are no other investmentbusiness opportunities available and the extra money is going into a low return savings account, you might as well pay down your debt. Or if you lack the self discipline to use the extra money properly  buying flat screens and meals out  then yeah just pay down your debt. But if youre disciplined with the extra money, use it to get access to more capital and make that new capital work for you."

For any ETF, the companys website should tell you when dividends are issued, usually under a section titled \"Distributions\" or something similar.

You could look up your holdings and see which ones recently issued a dividend in this case, it was AGG."

But you can still do backdoor Roth IRA contribution contribute to a Traditional IRA, then convert it to a Roth IRA assuming you do not have any pretax IRAs, this is identical to a Roth IRA contribution. But you already made a Roth IRA contribution for 2013, and did not do the backdoor. Lets assume that you want to turn it into a backdoor Roth IRA contribution, and that you dont have any pretax IRAs. There are two ways to do this Withdraw the Roth IRA you contributed including earnings. Then, do a normal backdoor Roth IRA contribution contribute to a Traditional IRA, then immediately convert it to Roth IRA. The earnings you had in the Roth IRA that you withdrew will be treated as normal income and taxed. The conversion will not be taxable because all of the Traditional IRA was nondeductible when you converted. Recharacterize your original Roth IRA contribution as a Traditional IRA contribution, then convert it to Roth IRA. It will be treated as if you made a Traditional IRA contribution originally, and then waited until now to convert. The earnings in the IRA up till now will be taxed on conversion. So in both cases, you will need to pay income tax on the earnings in the account up to now. The difference between the two is in the amount of money in the IRA now. With the first way, you can only contribute 5500 now. With the second way, you will keep the same amount of money you have in the IRA now."

Keep saving up until you have 20 down to buy a house of your own ideally that you can put on a 15 fixed mortgage, and pay it off as quickly as you can. Then you can start saving for your first rental property. If that process isnt fast enough for you, you have two options. Increase your income or reduce your expenses. Theres no shortcut to wealthbuilding without taking significant risks.

    "topic": "Why buy insurance?",
    "content": "First of all, insurance never covers the cost of the item, it is almost always a partial payout at best. For example, a typical house in the Northeast US where I live that costs 300,000 will have the actual house valued at maybe 100,00 and rest of the value will be in the land. Therefore, the insured value will typically be 100,000. The only problem is that to actually rebuild the house might easily cost 250,000. So, your idea that some kinds of insurance allows the beneficiary to recoup their loss is usually never true. As you say, from an actuarial point of view insurance is a sheer waste of money. For example, a typical house has maybe a 0.5 chance of burning down every year. In other words out of 2000 houses, maybe 1 will burn down every year. So, lets say you got 100,000 of insurance on your house. Then the value of that policy would be 100,000  2000  50 per year. An insurance company will charge around 700 per year for the policy. That means you are basically flushing 650 down the toilet every year to maintain that policy. The reason why they do this is what blankip says above, they are buying \"peace of mind\", a psychological product. In other they imagine they are somehow safe. So, even though they are losing money, paying it makes them feel as though they are not losing money. Its delusional, but then again most people have a lot of delusions of which insurance is just one of many."

    "topic": "Why do volatility stocksETFs TVIX, VXX, UVXY trend down in the longterm?",
    "content": "Since these indices only try to follow VIX and dont have the underlying constituents as the constituents dont really exist in most meaningful senses they will always deviate from the exact numbers but should follow the general pattern. Youre right, however, in stating that the graphs that you have presented are substantially different and look like the indices other than VIX are always decreasing. The problem with this analysis is that the basis of your graphs is different they all start at different dates... We can fix this by putting them all on the same graph this shows that the funds did broadly follow VIX over the period 5 years and this also encompasses a time when some of the funds started. The funds do decline faster than VIX from the beginning of 2012 onward and I had a theory for why so I grabbed a graph for that period. My theory was that, since volatility had fallen massively after the throes of the financial crisis there was less money to be made from betting on investing in? volatility and so the assets invested in the funds had fallen making them smaller in comparison to their 20112012 basis. Here we see that the funds are again closely following VIX until the beginning of 2016 where they again diverged lower as volatility fell, probably again as a result of withdrawals of capital as VIX returns fell. A tighter graph may show this again as the gap seems to be narrowing as people look to bet on volatility due to recent events. So... if the funds are basically following VIX, why has VIX been falling consistently over this time? Increased certainty in the markets and a return to growth or at least lower negative growth in most economies, particularly western economies where the majority of market investment occurs, and a reduction in the risk of European countries defaulting, particularly Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain the \"PIGS\" countries has resulted in lower volatility and a return to normalish market conditions. In summary the funds are basically following VIX but their values are based on their underlying capital. This underlying capital has been falling as returns on volatility have been falling resulting in their diverging from VIX whilst broadly following it on the new basis."

    "content": "I am not a lawyer, and I am assuming trusts in the UK work similar to the way they work in the US... A trust is a legally recognized entity that can act in business transactions much the same way as a person would own real property, a business, insurance, investments, etc.. The short answer is the trust is the owner of the property. The trust is established by a Grantor who \"funds\" the trust by transferring ownership of items from him or herself or itself, if another trust or business entity like a corporation to the trust. A Trustee is appointed usually by the Grantor to manage the trust according to the conditions and terms specified in the trust. A Trustee would be failing in their responsibility their fiduciary duty if they do not act in accordance with the purposes of the trust. Some trusts are written better than others, and there may or may not be room for broad interpretation of the purposes of the trust. The trust is established to provide some benefit to the Beneficiary. The beneficiary can be anyone or anything, including another trust. In the US, a living trust is commonly used as an estate planning tool, where the Grantor, Trustee, and Beneficiary are the same persons. At some point, due to health or other reasons, a new trustee can be appointed. Since the trust is a separate entity from the grantor and trustee, and it owns the assets, it can survive the death of the grantor, which makes it an attractive way to avoid having to probate the entire estate. A good living trust will have instructions for the Trustee on what to do with the assets upon the death of the Grantors."

Hit up you local credit union then your bank. Get your financing done first if you can. Now 690 credit score is one of 3 bureaus, not all banks and lending institutions use all three or the same one. Also the score isnt everything. That could be good or bad. The 23 range is normally for the 720 crowd unless its a manufacture. GM, Ford, so on With rates capping out at around 30 depending on state laws. However 690 should not be 19 on a new or late model car. At 690 at 19 you would have be going for a 70,000 mile 6 year or older car if I had to guess. Assuming you have no BKs and repos. Some times dealerships have to pay banks to get people financed. Its hidden in the cost and they by law are not allowed to tell you about it because it cannot be passed on to you. However the banks dont just fund any crazy amount of money either say like 115 of book and that it. That is where and why they want that big down payment because that is used to off set the finance amount and what you pay. Making the dealership money. and i can go on and on and on... But you should always try to get the funding prior. Your credit union wont charge the hidden fees and they only care about your down payment to see that you are making a commitment. If you are buying used. Save out 1500 for future repairs and tires and such. Dont buy paint protectant and such. If you finance thru the dealership and put less than 20 down DO buy Gap Insurance but thats it. I can go on and on but I wont. Feel free to ask though.

I then look at the cost of an item vs the amount of benefit it gets me either enjoyment or ability to make more money or both. If I only had a few things I wanted, it would be easy to buy them even if the payback wasnt that great, but because I have a large list of things Id like to be able to do, its easier to play the comparison game in my head. Do I want this 50 thing now that will only give me a little bit of enjoyment and no income, or would I rather be able to get that 3000 digital cinema camera that I would enjoy having and could work on projects with and actually make money off of? This is a RL example that I actually just bought last week after making sure I had solid leads on enough projects to pay myself back over time. For me, it is much easier to compare with an alternative thing Id enjoy, particularly since I enjoy hobbies that can pay for themselves, which is really the situation this strategy works best in. It might not work for everyone, but hobbies that pay for themselves can take many different forms. Mine tends to be very direct get AV tool, do projects that pay money, but it can also be indirect get sports stuff, save on gym membership over time. If you can get things onto your list that can save you money in the long run, then this strategy can work pretty well, if not, youll still have the overall saving problem, just with a longer wish list. That said, if you are good about saving already and simply want to make better use of your disposable income, then having a longer list may also work to let you seek out better deals for you. If you have funds that you know you can healthily spend on enjoyment, it is going to be difficult to choose nothing over something that gives enjoyment, even if it isnt a great return on the money. If you have alternatives that would give you better value, then its easier to avoid the low value option."

For example, in the US we dont pay taxes in source on investment income, and there are many credits and deductions that we cant take. So if I have a child and some interest income from my savings account  employers withholding will not match my actual tax liability. There are credits for children, additional taxes for the interest, and the actual tax brackets vary based on my marital status and filing options I chose. So even the same family of two people married will pay different amounts in taxes if they chose to file separate tax returns for each, than if they chose to file jointly on one tax return. For anyone whove lived anywhere else, like you and me, this system is ridiculously complex and inefficient, but for Americans  that works.

You can also elect to be taxed as an SCorp or a CCorp instead of a partnership, but that requires you to file a form explicitly making such election. If you go SCorp, then you will file a different form for the company, but the procedure is roughly the same  Income gets passed through to the owners via a Schedule K1.

There are restrictions, meaning that there can be only certain types of privileges or exchange between the donor and the organization. Essentially, it has to be a donation, and not a purchase of substantial goods or services. Your donation to these kinds of organizations doesnt hurt their funding elsewhere, or shouldnt. As mentioned above, if you dont itemize your deductions, you wont gain any extra tax savings from the donation. You shouldnt itemize if youre better off taking the standard deduction. Having said that, though, please give whatever youre led to give, after considering all of the ramifications financial and spiritual.

According to BankRate, the average credit score needed to buy a new car is 714, but they also show average interest rates at 6.39 for newcar loans to people with credit scores in the 601660 range. High income certainly helps offset credit score to some extent. Not every bankdealership does things the same way. Being selfemployed youd most likely be required to show 2 years of tax returns, and theyd use those as a basis for your income rather than whatever you have made recently. If using a cosigner, their income matters. Another key factor is debt to income ratio, if too much of someones income is already spoken for by other debts a lender will shy away. So, yes, theres a chance, given all the information we dont know and the variability with lender policies, that you could be turned down for a car loan. How should I go about this? If youre set on pursuing the car loan, just go talk to some lenders. Youll want to shop around for a good rate anyway, so no need to speculate just go find out. Include the dealership as a potential financing option, they can have great rates. Personally, Id get a much cheaper car. Your insurance premium on a 100k car will be quite high due to your age. You might be rightly confident in your earning potential, but nothing is guaranteed, situations can change wildly in short order. A new car is not a good investment or a valueretaining asset, so why bother going into debt for one if you dont have to? If you buy something in cash now, you could upgrade in a few years without financing if your earning prediction holds and would save quite a bit in car insurance and interest over the years between."

The major question I wanted the spreadsheet to answer was, how large is the benefit of using the Mortgage Relief scheme if you dont have any surplus income but only just enough to make the scheduled payment? This is the critical question because we know that if you use surplus income to make extra payments to principal, you pay down the mortgage more quickly. This is so whether you apply the income directly to the mortgage, as most borrowers do, or whether you follow the Mortgage Relief procedure where you use a credit line to pay down the mortgage and current income to pay down the credit line. I spent much of my air time between Philadelphia and San Francisco on this project, and finally gave it up. Once I removed surplus income from the equation, I could not find a way to make the Mortgage Relief scheme work. You may also want to read related articles by Guttentag"

This will probably require a call to the bank, but for less than an hour of you and your friends time you will save yourself a whole lot of hassle. The difference is like this if you worked at a business that added you as an authorized user for a credit or debit card, this would allow you to use the card to buy things. But that doesnt make the money in the bank yours! On the other hand if you are listed as \"joint\", this regards ownership, and it could become tricky to establish whether its your money or not to any governmental satisfaction. 2 You are completely correct in being honest with the agency, but thats not enough  if you dont know what the facts are, you cant really be honest with them. If the form is unclear its ok to ask, \"on having a bank account, does being listed as an authorized user on someone elses account count if it isnt my money or bank account?\" But if you are listed as holding the account jointly, that changes the question to \"I am listed as joint on someone elses checking account, but it isnt my money  how is that considered?\" To Social Security it might mean generating an extra form, or it might mean you need to have the status on the account changed, or they might not care. But if you dont get the facts first, they wont give you the right answers or help you need. And from personal experience, its a heck of a lot easier to get a straight and clear answer from a bank than it is from a federal government agency. Have the facts with you when you contact them and youll be ok  but trust me, you dont want them guessing!"

    "topic": "Why does a longpurchased call option have a long position in the option itself?",
    "content": "If it helps you to think about it, long is equivalent to betting for the upside and short is equivalent to betting for the downside. If you are long on options, then you expect the value of such options to increase. If you are long an option, then you own the option. If you are short an option, then generally you sold the option. Someone who is short a call sometimes called the writer or occasionally the issuer has sold a call option to someone who is now long a call. Buying a call option that will increase in value is itself a form of investment, just as its investment to buy stock or other instruments hoping they will appreciate in value. An options value will rise or fall with the underlying, so being long an option is a way to be long in the underlying. Someone can be long in a stock by buying the stock, or long in a call by buying call options in the stock. The long call generally requires less initial investment than buying the underlying, and lets the optionholder avoid the asset downside during the option term. The risk is that the asset may not appreciate to the point that the call option will pay off. In the conceptual sense, a share of stock is a particular right to the profits and assets of a corporation, both in form of dividends and in liquidation. An option is a particular right to the the share of stock. Its just a further way to formalize and subdivide the various property rights that exist in a corporation. If you can buy a piece of paper with particular rights to corporate profits and assets, then you can buy another piece of paper with particular rights to the former piece of paper."

If you own at least one share costing no more than say 100 often less, then these companies will take the dividends paid on these shares and automatically buy more shares as the income from the dividends pile up. This is a low cost of entry way of getting in on many high quality stocks. Stalwart stocks such as GE and many utility and real estate stocks REITs offer this. Check out these links Secondly you can look at brokerages that specialize in buying smaller amount of stocks on a regular basis to simulate a DRIP, ShareBuilder will allow you to invest say 50 or 100 a month into one or more stocks. However, at smaller amounts, their commission fees can eat in to your returns. Folio investing does the same thing as Sharebuilder.

    "topic": "Why do stocks go up? Is it due to companies performing well, or what else? [duplicate]",
    "content": "Supply and Demand, pure and simple! There are two basic forms of this  a change in the quantity demandedsupplied at any given price, and a true change in the amount of demandsupply itself. Please note that this can be distinct from the underlying change in the value of the company andor its expected future cash flows, which are a function of both financial performance and future expectations. If more people want the stock that are willing to sell it at a given price at a given point in time, sellers will begin to offer the stocks at higher prices until the market is no longer willing to bear the new price, and vice versa. This will reduce the quantity of stocks demanded by buyers until the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied once again reach an equilibrium, at which point a transaction occurs. Because people are motivated to buy and sell for different reasons at different times, and because people have different opinions on a constant flow of new information, prices change frequently. This is one of the reasons why executives of a recent IPO dont typically sell all of their stock at once. In addition to legal restrictions and the message this would send to the market, if they flooded the market with additional quantities of stock supplied, all else being equal, since there is no corresponding increase in the quantity demanded, the price would drop significantly. Sometimes, the demand itself for a companys stock shifts. Unlike a simple change in price driven by quantity supplied versus quantity demanded, this is a more fundamental shift. For example, lets suppose that the current demand for rare earth metals is driven by their commercial applications in consumer electronics. Now if new devices are developed that no longer require these metals, the demand for them will fall, regardless of the actions of individual buyers and sellers in the market. Another example is when the \"rules of the game\" for an industry change dramatically. Markets are behavioral. In this sense prices are most directly driven by human behavior, which hopefully is based on wellinformed opinions and facts. This is why sometimes the price keeps going up when financial performance decreases, and why sometimes it does not rise even while performance is improving. This is also why some companies stock continues to rise even when they lose huge sums of money year after year. The key to understanding these scenarios is the opinions and expectations that buyers and sellers have of that information, which is expressed in their market behavior."

I recall a few years ago when there were articles out there in financial circles talking about how more than a few penny stocks were being manipulated by organized crime syndicates. Another big issue with penny stocks is liquidity. Since theyre so thinly traded not a great deal of daily volume, anyone who puts enough money into a penny stock to make it worth the effort almost certainly becomes the biggest trader in the stock, which can make it tough to liquidate positions. There are not enough market makers in the stock to be competitive, so you have to accept the bidask prices of whoever is willing to execute the trades, so the margins evaporate quickly. Penny stocks are something you can trade if youre bored, have money to burn, and just want to toy around with something just for the heck of it that youll ultimately lose out on."

    "content": "I think youre on the wrong track. Getting more and more samples from the real world does not make your backtest more accurate, it just confirms that your strategy can withstand one particular sample path of a stochastic process. The reason why you find it simple to incorporate fees, commissions, taxes, etc. is because theyre a static and constant process  well they might change over time but most definitely uncorrelated to the markets. Modelling overnight returns or the top levels of the order book the next day is serious work. First you have to select a suitable model thats mostly theoretical work but experience can help a lot. Then, in order to do it datadriven, youd have to plough through thousands of days of sample data on a set of thousands of instruments to get a \"feeling\" aka significant model parameters. Apropos data mining, I think Excel might be the wrong tool for the job. Level2 data even just the first 10 levels is a massive blob. For example, the NYSE OpenBook historical data weighs in at a massive 15 TB compressed uncompressed 74 TB for the last 10 years, and costs USD 200k. Anyway, as for other factors to take into account So how to account for all this in a backtest? Personally, I would put in some penalty terms as  on a return basis for every factor you want to consider, dont hardcode them. You can then run a stress test by exploring these parameters i.e. assign some values in the range of 0 to whatever fits. Explore them individually only set one penalty term at a time to get a feeling how the strategy might react to stress from that factor. Then you can run the backtest with typical or observed combinations of penalty factors and slowly stress them altogether. Edit Just to avoid confusion about terminology. A backtest in the strict sense had I implemented this strategy X years ago, what would have happened? wont benefit from any modelling simply because the realworld \"does the sampling\" for us. However, to evaluate a strategys robustness you should account for the additional factors and run some stress tests. If the strategy performs well in the realworld or nostress scenario but produces losses once a tiny slippage occurs every now and again, you could conclude that the strategy is very fragile. The key is to explore the maximum stress the strategy can handle by whatever measure if a lot you can call the strategy robust. The latter is what I personally call a backtest the first procedure would go by the name \"extension towards the past\" or so. Some lightweight literature"

Any shortfall has to be repaid, out of pocket, or in some cases added to the price of the new car and included in the principal of the new loan. You cannot calculate how much you still owe the way you have, because it totally ignores interest. Advice on practicality Dont do this. You will be upside down even worse on the new car from the instant you drive off the lot. Sell the current vehicle, find a way to pay the difference  one that doesnt involve financing. Cut your losses on the upside down vehicle. Then purchase a new vehicle. Im in the \"Pay cash for gently used\" school, YMMV. Another option is to go to your bank. Refinance your car now to get a lower interest rate. Pay as much of the principal as you can. Keep that car until it is paid off. Then you will not be upside down. If youre asking how to use the estimator on the webpage. Put the payoff in the downpayment as a negative and the trade in value in the trade in spot. Expect the payment to go up significantly.

Very few people lose badly enough to win. Most people just pay money into insurance and never get as much back as they pay in. For most people, in most lives, insurance is a bad deal. The reason people crave insurance is because they cannot calculate the probability of something bad happening as well as an actuary can do so. The gap in knowledge between you and and actuary is what make insurance providers rich and you poor. They are smart, you are not. You think some terrible thing is going to happen to you, they know it probably wont. So they sell you a product you probably will never need. Anyhow, most people cant understand probability, and how to analyze risk, so they wont get what Im saying here.

There is a difference in high  amount of the dividend and the yield. A 1share dividend payout may sound good up front, but... how much is that stock costing you? If the stock cost you 100share, then you are getting 1 yield. If the stock cost you 10share, you are getting 10 yield. There are a lot of factors that come into play when investing in dividend stocks for cash flow. Keep in mind why are you investing in the first place. Growth or cash flow. Arrange your investing around your major investment goals. Dont chase big dollar dividend checks, do your research and follow a proven investment plan to reach your goals safely."

    "content": "Equity does not represent production divisions in a company i.e. chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla does not make sense. In Sole proprietorship, equity represents 1 owner. In Partnership, equity has at least two subaccounts, namely Partner 1 and Partner 2. In Corporations, equity may have Common Stockholders and Preferred Stockholders, or even different class of shares for insiders and angel investors. As you can see, equity represents who owns the company. It is not what the company does or manufactures. First and foremost, define the boundary of the firm. Are your books titled \"The books of the family of Doe\", \"The books of Mr  Mrs Doe\", or \"The books of Mr  Mrs Doe  Sons\". Ask yourself, who \"owns\" this family. If you believe that a marriage is perpetual until further notice then it does not make any sense to constantly calculate which parent owns the family more. In partnership, firm profits are attributed to partners accounts using previously agreed ratio. For example, 6040 because Partner 1 is more hard working and valuable to the firm. Does your child own this family? Does heshe have any rights to use the assets, to earn income from the assets, to transfer the assets to others, or to enforce private property rights? If they dont have a part of these rights, they are certainly NOT part of Equity. So what happens to the expenses of children if you follow the \"partnership\" model? There are two ways. The first way is to attribute the Loss to the parentsfamily since you do not expect the children to repay. It is an unrecoverable loss written off. The second way is to create a DebtorAsset account to aggregate all child expense, then create a separate book called \"The books Children 1\", and classify the expense in that separate book. I advise using \"The family of Doe\" as the firms boundary, and having 1 Equity account to simplify everything. It is ultimately up to you to decide the boundaries."

This has SIGNIFICANTLY less volatility for the same statistical expectation. Left tail risk is MUCH lower probability of gigantic losses since losses will tend to cancel out gains in diversified portfolios. Moreover, your view that \"you believe these will continue\" is fallacious. Stocks of developed countries are efficient to the extent that retail investors cannot predict price evolution in the future. Countless academic studies show that individual investors forecast in the incorrect direction on average. I would be quite right to objectively classify you as a incorrect if you continued to hold the philosophy that owning 1 stock instead of the entire market is a superior stategy. ALL the evidence favours holding the market. In addition, do not invest in active managers. Academic evidence demonstrates that they perform worse than holding a passive markettracking portfolio after fees, and on average and plz dont try to select managers that you think can outperform  you cant do this, even the best in the field cant do this. Direct answer It depends on your investment horizon. If you do not need the money until you are 60 then you should invest in very aggressive assets with high expected return and high volatility. These assets SHOULD mainly be stocks through ETFs or mutual funds but could also include USREIT or globalREIT ETFs, private equity and a handful of other asset classes no gold, please. ... or perhaps wealth management products which pool many retail investors funds together and create a diversified portfolio but Im unconvinced that their fees are worth the added diversification. If you need the money in 23 years time then you should invest in safe assets  fixed income and term deposits. Why is investment horizon so important? If you are holding to 60 years old then it doesnt matter if we have a massive financial crisis in 5 years time, since the stock market will rebound unless its a nuclear bomb in New York or something and by the time you are 60 you will be laughing all the way to the bank. Gains on risky assets overtake losses in the long run such that over a 2030 year horizon they WILL do much better than a deposit account. As you approach 4550, you should slowly reduce your allocation to risky assets and put it in safe haven assets such as fixed income and cash. This is because your investment horizon is now SHORTER so you need a less risky portfolio so you dont have to keep working until 6570 if the market tanks just before retirement. VERY IMPORTANT. If you may need the savings to avoid defaulting on your home loan if you lose your job or something, then the above does not apply. Decisions in these context are more vague and ambiguous."

Expose 400k to market risk, and get a guaranteed 3.75 return on that 200k in essence. Then you can invest the money you were putting towards your mortgage each month. The potential disadvantage, is that the extra 200k investment could earn significantly more than 3.75, and youd lose out on some money. Historically, the market beats 3.75, and youd come out ahead investing everything. Theres no guarantee. You also dont have to keep your money invested, you can change your position down the road and pay off the house. I feel best about a paid off house, but I know that my sense of security carries opportunity cost. Up to you to decide how much risk youre willing to accept.

    "topic": "Is paying off your mortage a 1 personal finance priority?",
    "content": "For some people, it should be a top priority. For others, there are higher priorities. What it should be for you depends on a number of things, including your overall financial situation both your current finances and how stable you expect them to be over time, your level of financial \"education\", the costs of your mortgage, the alternative investments available to you, your investing goals, and your tolerance for risk. Your 1 priority should be to ensure that your basic needs including making the required monthly payment on your mortgage are met, both now and in the near future, which includes paying off highinterest i.e. credit card debt and building up an emergency fund in a savings or moneymarket account or some other lowrisk and liquid account. If you havent done those things, do not pass Go, do not collect 200, and do not consider making advance payments on your mortgage. Mason Wheelers statements that the bank cant take your house if youve paid it off are correct, but its going to be a long time till you get there and they can take it if youre partway to paying it off early and then something bad happens to you and you start missing payments. If youre not underwater, you should be able to get some of your money back by selling  possibly at a loss  before it gets to the point of foreclosure, but youll still have to move, which can be costly and unappealing. So make sure youve got what you need to handle your basic needs even if you hit a rough patch, and make sure youre not financing the paying off of your house by taking a loan from Visa at 27 annually. Once youve gotten through all of those moreimportant things, you finally get to decide what else to invest your extra money in. Different investments will provide different rewards, both financial and emotional and Mason Wheeler has clearly demonstrated that he gets a strong emotional payoff from not having a mortgage, which may or may not be how you feel about it. On the financial side of any potential investment, youll want to consider things like the expected rate of return, the risk it carries both on its own and whether it balances out or unbalances the overall risk profile of all your investments in total, its expected costs including its  and your  tax rate and any preferred tax treatment, and any other potential factors such as an employer match on 401k contributions, which are basically free money to you. Then you weigh the pros and cons financial and emotional of each option against your imperfect forecast of what the future holds, take your best guess, and then keep adjusting as you go through life and things change. But I want to come back to one of the factors I mentioned in the first paragraph. Which options you should even be considering is in part influenced by the degree to which you understand your finances and the wide variety of options available to you as well as all the subtleties of how different things can make them more or less advantageous than one another. The fact that youre posting this question here indicates that youre still early in the process of learning those things, and although its great that youre educating yourself on them and keep doing it!, it means that youre probably not ready to worry about some of the things other posters have talked about, such as Cost of Capital and ROI. So keep reading blog posts and articles online theres no shortage of them, and keep developing your understanding of the options available to you and their pros and cons, and wait to tackle the full suite of investment options till you fully understand them. However, theres still the question of what to do between now and then. Paying the mortgage down isnt an unreasonable thing for you to do for now, since its a guaranteed rate of return that also provides some degree of emotional payoff. But Id say the higher priority should be getting money into a taxadvantaged retirement account a 401k403bIRA, because the taxadvantaged growth of those accounts makes their longterm return far greater than whatever youre paying on your mortgage, and they provide more benefit taxadvantaged growth the earlier you invest in them, so doing that now instead of paying off the house quicker is probably going to be better for you financially, even if it doesnt provide the emotional payoff. If your employer will match your contributions into that account, then its a nobrainer, but its probably still a better idea than the mortgage unless the emotional payoff is very very important to you or unless youre nearing retirement age so the taxfree growth period is small. If youre not sure what to invest in, just choose something thats broadmarket and lowcost totalmarket index funds are a great choice, and you can diversify into other things as you gain more savvy as an investor what matters more is that you start investing in something now, not exactly what it is. Disclaimer Im not a personal advisor, and this does not constitute investing advice. Understand your choices and make your own decisions."

If you had a business you would now have to declare the expense on your business taxes. This would also then be income for her, which she would have to account for on her taxes. Remember there are both state and federal taxes involved. Regarding expenses like diapers. If the MIL had the business she could deduct them as a business expense. If you have the business it would greatly complicate the taxes. Your business would be essentially covering your personal expenses. If your MIL was not a business the cost of diapers would be paid by you regardless of the working situation of you and your spouse. To claim the tax credit You must report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number either the social security number, or the employer identification number of the care provider on your return. If the care provider is a taxexempt organization, you need only report the name and address on your return. You can use Form W10 PDF, Dependent Care Providers Identification and Certification, to request this information from the care provider. If you do not provide information regarding the care provider, you may still be eligible for the credit if you can show that you exercised due diligence in attempting to provide the required information. The IRS will be looking for an income tax form from your MIL that claims the income. Getting too cute with the babysitting situation, by starting a business just for the purpose of saving money on taxes could invite an audit. Also it is not as if you just claim 3000 and you are good to go. You can only claim a percentage of the expenses based on the household AGI, the more the make the more you have to have in expenses to get the full 3000 credit, which mil cause more taxes for your MIL.

While some investors may get cash from Apple, Id suspect most shareholders arent likely to see cash unless they are selling their shares so I wouldnt say yes to this without qualification.

It might be tempting to try to pay off all your debts at once, and while that would be satisfying, it would be a poor investment of your inheritance. When you have debt, you have to think about how much that debt is costing you to keep open. Since you have 0APR on your student loan, it does not make sense to pay any more than the minimum payments. You may want to look into getting a personal loan to pay off your other personal debts. The interest rates for a loan will probably be much less than what you are paying currently. This will allow you to put a payment plan together that is affordable. You can also use your inheritance as collateral for the loan. Getting a loan will most likely give you a better credit rating as well. You may also be tempted to get a brand new sports car, but that would also not be a good idea at all. You should shop for a vehicle based on your current income, and not your savings. I believe you can get the same rates for an auto loan for a car up to 3 years old as a brand new car. It would be worth your while to shop for a quality used car from a reputable dealer. If it is a certified used car, you can usually carry the rest of the new car warranty. The biggest return on investment you have now is your employer sponsored 401k account. Find out how long it takes for you to become fully vested. Being vested means that you can leave your job and keep all of your employer contributions. If possible, max out, or at least contribute as much as you can afford to that fund to get employee matching. You should also stick with your job until you become fully vested. The money you have in retirement accounts does you no good when you are young. There is a significant penalty for early withdrawal, and that age is currently 59 12. Doing the math, it would be around 2052 when you would be able to have access to that money. You should hold onto a certain amount of your money and keep it in a higher interest rate savings account, or a money market account. You say that your living situation will change in the next year as well. Take full advantage of living as cheaply as you can. Dont make any unnecessary purchases, try to brown bag it to lunch instead of eating out, etc. Save as much as you can and put it into a savings account. You can use that money to put a down payment on a house, or for the security and first months rent. Try not to spend any money from your savings, and try to support yourself as best as you can from your income. Make a budget for yourself and figure out how much you can spend every month. Dont factor in your savings into it. Your savings should be treated as an emergency fund. Since you have just completed school, and this is your first big job out of college, your income will most likely improve with time. It might make sense to job hop a few times to find the right position. You are much more likely to get a higher salary by changing jobs and employers than you are staying in the same one for your entire career. This generally is true, even if you are promoted at the by the same employer. If you do leave your current job, you would lose what your employer contributed if you are not vested. Even if that happened, you would still keep the portion that you contributed."

There you would get a first for 80 of the value of a home and 20 on a HELOC for the rest. This would help the buyer avoid PMI. Editorially, the reason this was popular was because the buyer could not afford the home with the PMI and did not have a down payment. They were simply cutting things too close. Could you find a banker willing to do something like this, I bet you could. In your case it seems like you are attempting to increase the value of your home by using money to do an improvement so the situation is better. However, sizable improvements rarely return 100 or more on investments. Typically, I would think, the bank would want you to have some money invested too. So if you wanted to put in a pool, a smart banker would have you put in about 60 of the costs as pools typically have a 40 ROI. However, I bet you can find a banker that would loan you 100. You dont seem to be looking for advice on making a smart money decision, and it is difficult to render a verdict as very little detail is supplied about your specific situation.

    "topic": "Paying taxes on dividends even though your capital gains were 0?",
    "content": "Id agree that this can seem a little unfair, but its an unavoidable consequence of the necessary practicality of paying out dividends periodically rather than continuously, and differential taxation of income and capital gains. To see more clearly whats going on here, consider buying stock in a company with extremely simple economics it generates a certain, constant earnings stream equivalent to 10 per share per annum, and redistributes all of that profit as periodic dividends lets say once annually. Assume theres no intrinsic growth, and that the firms instrinsic value which well say is 90 per share is completely neutral to any other market factors. Under these economics, this stock price will show a \"sawtooth\" evolution, accruing from 90 to 100 over the course of a year, and resetting back down to 90 after each dividend payment. Now, if I am invested in this stock for some period of time, the fair outcome would be that I receive an appropriately timeweighted share of the 10 annual earnings per share, less my tax. If I am invested for an exact calendar year, this works as Id expect the stock price on any given day in the year will be the same as it was exactly one year earlier, so Ill realise zero capital gain, but Ill have collected a 10 taxed dividend along the way. On the other hand, what if I am invested for exactly half a year, spanning a dividend payment? I receive a dividend payment of 10 less tax, but I make a capital loss of 5. Overall, pretax, Im up 5 per share as expected. However, the respective tax treatment of the dividend payment which is classed as income and the capital gains is likely to be different. In particular, to benefit from the \"negative\" taxation of the capital loss I need to have some positive capital gain elsewhere to offset it  if I cant do that, Im much worse off compared to half the fullyear return. Further, even if I can offset against a gain elsewhere the effective taxation rates are likely to be different  but note that this could work for or against me if my capital gains rate is greater than my income tax rate Id actually benefit. And if Im invested for half a year, but not spanning a dividend, I make 5 of pure capital gains, and realise a different effective taxation rate again. In an ideal world Id agree that the effective taxation rate wouldnt depend on the exact timing of my transactions like this, but in reality its unavoidable in the interests of practicality. And so long as the rules are clear, I wouldnt say its unfair per se, it just adds a bit of complexity."

His words, paraphrased At the end of the day, you have to have a place to stay. Your mortgage payment is replacing your rent except in this case, youre paying yourself instead of someone else. You lose a little flexibility in being able to up and move with relative ease. However, youve lived in apartments, you know that rent almost only goes up. Your mortgage will not.

    "topic": "When a company liquidates, are earlier investors paid back first?",
    "content": "All shares of the same class are considered equal. Each class of shares may have a different preference in order of repayment. After all company liabilities have been paid off [including bank debt, wages owing, taxes outstanding, etc etc.], the remaining cash value in a company is distributed to the shareholders. In general, there are 2 types of shares Preferred shares, and Common shares. Preferred shares generally have 3 characteristics 1 they get a stated dividend rate every year, sometimes regardless of company performance 2 they get paid out first on liquidation and 3 they can only receive their stated value on liquidation  that is, 1M of preferred shares will be redeemed for at most 1M on liquidation, assuming the corporation has at least that much cash left. Common Shares generally have 4 characteristics 1 their dividends are not guaranteed or may be based on a calculation relative to company performance, 2 they can vote for members of the Board of Directors who ultimately hire the CEO and make similar high level business decisions 3 they get paid last on liquidation and 4 they get all value remaining in the company once everyone else has been paid. So it is not the order of share subscription that matters, it is the class. Once you know how much each class gets, based on the terms listed in that share subscription, you simply divide the total class payout by number of shares, and pay that much for each share a person holds. For companies organized otherthan as corporations, ie partnerships, the calculation of whogetswhat will be both simpler and more complex. Simpler in that, generally speaking, a partnership interest cannot be of a different class, like shares can, meaning all partners are equal relative to the size of their partnership interest. More complex in that, if the initiation of the company was done in an informal way, it could easily become a legal fight as to who contributed what to the company."

Margins are thin, so if there are retail salespeople milling about, their compensation isnt coming from the TV or computer with a 6 gross margin. It comes from the extended warranty programs which are not insurance and do not have regulated underwriting standards, which are typically sold at a 6595 gross margin. So that 200 warranty most likely costs the retailer 50. The salesman gets 1525. I paid for my college education working at a CompUSA selling these things, along with other high margin items that paid commission. In most cases, you arent getting much coverage anyway. Most products carry a 1 year warranty, and using most \"gold\" or \"platinum\" credit cards doubles a manufacturers warranty by up to 1 year. So with most transactions, you are already walking away with a 2 year warranty. Warranties or service plans make sense for durable goods that cost alot and are expected to last a long time andor require regular maintenance. I think they especially make sense if your budget is really tight  a fixed maintenance cost can be an asset to some people because they can plan around it.

Also, for anything where the credit card might be used to cover any damages or charges you might incur later as part of the transaction. In essence, they are reserving part of your credit limit, ostensibly to cover charges they reasonably expect you might incur. For example, when you start pumping gas using a credit card they may block out 100 to make sure you dont pump a full tank and your credit card is declined because you ran over your limit at 3. In general, the blocks clear fairly quickly after you settle up with the company on your final bill. You can also ask the company to clear the block, but I dont think they are required to by law in any specific time period. It may be up to their and your agreement with the credit card company. Normally it isnt an issue and you dont even notice this going on behind the scenes, but if you keep your credit card near its limit, or use a debit card it can lead to nasty surprises e.g. they can make you overdraw your account.

One thats a bit lower than FMV, but its a discount for a tenant who will handle certain things on their own. I had an arms length tenant, who was below FMV, I literally never met him. But, our agreement through a realtor, was that for any repairs, I was not required to arrange or meet repairmen. FMV is not a fixed number, but a bit of a range. If this is your first rental, you need to be aware of the requirement to take depreciation. Simply put, you separate your cost into land and house. The house value gets depreciated by 127.5 i.e. you divide the value by 27.5 and thats taken as depreciation each year. You may break even on cash flow, the rent paying the mortgage, property tax, etc, but the depreciation might still produce a loss. This isnt optional. It flows to your tax return, and is limited to 25Kyr. Further, if your adjusted gross income is over 100K, the allowed loss is phased out over the next 50K of income. i.e. each 1000 of AGI reduces the allowed loss by 500. The losses you cant take are carried forward, until you use them to offset profit each year, or sell the property. If you offer numbers, youll get a more detailed answer, but this is the general overview. In general, if you are paying tax, you are doing well, running a profit even after depreciation."

Assuming I receive this 3500, am I better off using the bulk to pay off my credit cards, or should I keep as much cash available as I can? This would depend on the interest rate that is associated with the credit cards and the 3500. If the 3500 has a higher interest rate than your credit cards, then do not use any of it to pay your credit cards. Paying back the money you borrow hurts but its the interest rate that does you in. If the interest rate for the 3500 is lower than the credit card interest, then placing some of it on the credit cards may be a wise course of action. But this depends on how long you are out of work. If you could be out of work for an extended period of time, I would recommend holding on to all of the funds. Note on saving I know this goes against the grain, but I would actually not recommend saving several months worth of funds maybe one month though. Most employers offer some type of retirement savings account 401k, Thrift Savings Plan, etc.. I contribute 5 to this fund instead of putting the money in savings. This is an especially effective strategy if your employer offers matching contributions such as mine. Because the divedends for a savings account are so low, it is not a wise place to store your money in the long run. If I had placed my Thrift Savings Plan contributions in a standard savings account, I would now be 12,000 poorer. In addition to this, most long term investment accounts allow you to withdraw the money early in case of emergency, such as being without work. I also find it too temping to have huge amounts of funds on hand."

When using fundamental analysis all you are doing is trying to figure out how much a company is worth. The vocabulary and huge range of acronyms can be intimidating but really its a fairly simple task. You can use investopedia for definitions and simple examples when you do not fully understand something. IE PEG You can search for definitions using the search bar on the top right google also is a good source to look for additional definitions. I recommend starting out by doing an independent analysis on a well known name such as Proctor  Gamble or Mcdonalds. Then you can compare your analysis to a professionals and see how they stack up.

Side Notes Personally when I first began using fundamental analysis I found it difficult to understand why something is considered undervalued or overvalued. I couldnt figure out who was the \"authority\" on saying this. Well in short the \"authority\" basically is the market. You can say you believe XYZ is undervalued but you are only proven correct if the market agrees with you over long period of time. Some key facts you should know Many times a stock can be \"broken\" for many reasons. The price can go far beyond what would be considered a \"normal valuation\" this is considered a bubble, e.g. the tech bubble of 19992000. It can also go far below a \"normal valuation\". In most cases these types of valuations are short lived and in the end a stock should return to \"normal valuation\" or at least this is the theory behind fundamental analysis."

Mostly to the agents, but also to county fees, city fees, deed tax, and possibly covering closing costs for the buyers. So if you sell a 400k house for the same price you buy, just in fees, youre out 40k. Mortgages are structured so that the frontend is very interest heavy, while at the end youre mostly paying towards principal. So for the first two years you will pay down very little of the principal. Figure around 2500 for the mortgage, and without running the numbers I bet you would pay an average for the first two years of around 1800month in interest. 43,200. Mortgage interest is tax deductible, so youll get some of that back. Thats also 16,800 in equity youll have on the house, so youll get that back out when you sell. Rough numbers, I would be you lose around 50k buying the house and selling for the same price two years later. That doesnt take into account having to do any maintenance. And it assumes you can sell quickly when you want to. Renting is not throwing away money. You dont lose any money. You get a place to live in exchange.

Unfortunately, the U.S. Government has made it illegal for the banks to give you a \"good faith estimate\" of the mortgage cost and terms without submitting a mortgage application. On the other hand, government regulations make the \"good faith estimates\" somewhat misleading. For one thing, they rarely are good for estimating how much money you will need to \"bring to the closing table\". My understanding is that in the United States, multiple credit checks within a twoweek period while shopping for a mortgage are combined to ding your credit rating only once. You need the following information to shop for a mortgage A realistic \"appraisal value\". Unless your market is going up quickly, a fair purchase price is usually close enough. Your expected loan amount which you or a banker can estimate based on your down payment and likely closing costs. Your middle credit score, for purposes of mortgage applications. If you have a coborrower, such as a spouse, many banks use the lower of the two persons middle credit score. The annual property tax cost for the property, taking into account the new purchase price. The annual cost of homeowners insurance. The annual cost of homeowners association dues. Your minimum monthly payments on all debt. Banks tend to round up the minimum payments. Also, banks care whether any of that debt is secured by real estate. Your monthly income. Banks usually include just the amount for which you can show that you are currently in the job, with regular paychecks and tax withholding, and that you have been in similar jobs or training for such jobs for the last two full years. Banks usually subtract out any business losses that show up on tax returns. There are special rules for alimony and child support payments. The loan terms you want, such as a 15year fixed rate or 30year fixed rate. The amount of points you are willing to pay. Many banks are willing to lower your \"note rate\" by 0.125 if you pay 0.5 upfront. The pros and cons of paying points is a good topic for another question. Whether you want a socalled \"nofee\" or \"noclosing cost\" loan. These loans cost less upfront, but have a higher \"note rate\". Unless you ask for a \"nofee\" or \"noclosing cost\" loan, most banks have similar charges for things like So the big differences are usually in As discussed above, you can come up with a simple number for roughly comparing fixedrate mortgage loan offers. Take the loan origination and similar fees, and divide them by the loan amount. Divide that percentage by 4. Add that percentage to the \"note rate\" for a loan with \"no points\". Use that last adjusted note rate to compare offers. This method works because you have the choice of using upfront savings to pay \"points\" to lower the \"note rate\". Notice that once you have your middle credit score, you can ask other lenders to estimate the information above without actually submitting another loan application. Because the mortgage market fluctuates, you should compare rates on the same morning of the same day.

The financial merits and demerits of this have been debated, but it is unlikely to lose you a lot of money, and if it has the psychological benefit of inducing you to invest, it can be worth it even if it results in slightly lessthanoptimal gains. More generally, you are right with what you say at the end of your question in the long run, when you start wont matter, as long as you continue to invest regularly. The Bogleheadstyle indexfundbased theory is basically that, yes, you might save money by investing at certain times, but in practice its almost impossible to know when those times are, so the better choice is to just keep investing no matter what. If you do this, you will eventually invest at high and low points, so the ups and downs will be moderated. Also, note that from this perspective, your example of investing in 2007 is incorrect. Its true that a person who put money in 2007, and then sat back and did nothing, would have barely broken even by now. But a person who started to invest in 2007, and continued to invest throughout the economic downturn, would in fact reap substantial rewards due to continued investing throughout the post2007 lows. Happily, I speak from experience on this point!"

    "content": "Yes, it is a very good idea to start your credit history early. It sounds like you have a good understanding of the appropriate use of credit, as a substitute for cash rather than a supplement to income. As long as you keep your expenses under control and pay off your card each month, I see no problems with the idea. Try to find a card with no annual fees, a low interest rate if possible which will be difficult at your age, and with some form of rewards such as cash back. Look for a reputable issuing bank, and keep the account open even after you get a new card down the road. Your credit score is positively correlated with having an account open for a long time, having a good credit usage to credit limit ratio, and having accounts in good standing and paid on time."

    "content": "Growth in a 401k dodges taxes, which means more of the gains get reinvested. Effectively, its a boosted return rate. Like any investment, a 401k can lose value. During the period before retirement, lower stock and bond prices actually help you buy more shares than you could if prices were high, so the real question is what the funds are doing at the time you start pulling money back out. That concern is why investors generally, not just 401k investors, should change their investment mix over time, to balance oossible risk against time to recover and possible reward. And if your employer matches 401k contributions to any degree, that too improves your effective gains and buffers you against some of ghe risk. Hence the general advice that if you dont fund your 401k at least enough to max out the company match, youre leaving free money on the table."

    "topic": "Should I pay more into company pension, or is there a better way to save?",
    "content": "In the UK you have an allowance of 40,000 per annum for tax relief into a pension. This amount includes both your and your employers contributions. If you earn more than 150,000 per annum this allowance starts to reduce and if you earn less than the allowance, your allowance is limited to what you earn. You can also carry over unused allowance from up to 3 years previously. If you stick within this allowance you wont pay tax on your pension contributions, if you go over the excess will be subject to tax. Salary exchange normally lets you avoid the National Insurance value of your contribution being taxed. If you paid your own money into your pension without going through salary exchange, your contributions would have the 20 basic rate of tax credited to them and if youre a higher rate taxpayer you could reclaim the difference between the basic rate of tax and the higher rate of tax you pay but the National Insurance youve paid on your own money would not be reclaimable. You cant get the money back youve paid into your pension till you are are 58 given that you are 27 now, the minimum age has risen from its historic 55 for your age group. Thats the pension trade off, you forgo tax now in the expectation that, once retired, you will be paying tax at a lower rate because your income will be lower and you are much less likely to be subject to higher rate taxation in return for locking in your money till youre older. Your pension income will be subject to tax when you eventually take it. There are other options such as ISAs which have lower annual limits 20,000 currently and on which your contributions do not attract tax relief, but which are not taxed as income when you eventually spend them. ISAs and pensions are not mutually exclusive so if you have the money, you can do both. Its up to you to determine what mix of savings will be appropriate to generate income for your eventual retirement. If you are living in some other country when you retire your pension will be paid net of UK tax. You might then be able to claim or pay any difference between that and your local tax rate depending on what agreement exists between the UK government and the other countrys government."

    "topic": "Negative Balance from Automatic Options Exercise. What to do?",
    "content": "Automatic exercisions can be extremely risky, and the closer to the money the options are, the riskier their exercisions are. It is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk. Since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option, its solvency policy is already risky. Regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability, the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible. If there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan, the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan. Since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase, the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary. Accounts after exercise For deep in the money exercised options, a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying. The next decision should be based upon risk and position selection. First, if the position is no longer attractive, it should be closed. Since its deep in the money, simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable, so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt. If the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to ones liability policy and of course to margin limits. In a margin account, closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade. If the positions are closed on any business day after the exercision, there will be no penalty or restriction. Cash option accounts While this is possible, many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account, and the ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement seems ambiguous, but their options trading page implies the upgrade. In a cash account, equities are not marginable, so any margin will trigger a margin call. If the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100. Equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid, so during a call exercise, the exercisor or exercisors broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, and any deficit is financed with debt, thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would. To preempt a forced exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, but this will be more expensive, and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud. The least expensive way to trade out of options positions is to close them themselves rather than take delivery."

I believe the IRS considers these permanently attached because the foam itself is permanently attached, and is a part of the installation. To the best of my knowledge, the only flooring that is considered as a separate unit of property is tuckedin carpet or carpet pads typically installed in commercial buildings, not homes. Everything else youll have to prove to be an independent separate unit of property. Technically, you can take the tucked in carpet, and move it elsewhere asis and be able to install it there assuming the size fits. You cannot do it with the foam at the very least youll need a new foam cover in the new location since you cannot take the foam with you from the old one.

The standard loan formula for an ordinary annuity can be used as described by BobbyScon, but the periodic interest rate has to be calculated from an effective APR, not a nominal rate.

See the section Calculating the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity. The payment formula is derived from the sum of the payments, each discounted to present value. I.e.

    "content": "John Bensins answer covers the math, but I like the plainEnglish examples of the theory from William Bernsteins fine book, The Intelligent Asset Allocator. At the authors web site, you can find the complete chapter 1 and chapter 2, though not chapter 3, which is the one with the \"multiple coin toss\" portfolio example I want to highlight. Ill summarize Bernsteins multiple coin toss example here with some excerpts from the book. Another top user, JoeTaxpayer, has also written about the coin flip on his blog, also mentioning Bernsteins book. Bernstein begins Chapter 1 by describing an offer from a fictitious \"Uncle Fred\" Imagine that you work for your rich but eccentric Uncle Fred. [...] he decides to let you in on the company pension plan. [...] you must pick ahead of time one of two investment choices for the duration of your employment Certificates of deposit with a 3 annualized rate of return, or, A most peculiar option At the end of each year Uncle Fred flips a coin. Heads you receive a 30 investment return for that year, tails a minus 10 loss for the year. This will be hereafter referred to as \"Uncle Freds coin toss,\" or simply, the \"coin toss.\" In effect, choosing option 2 results in a higher expected return than option 1, but it is certainly riskier, having a high standard deviation and being especially prone to a series of bad tosses. Chapters 1 and 2 continue to expand on the idea of risk, and take a look at various assetsmarkets over time. Chapter 3 then begins by introducing the multiple coin toss example Time passes. You have spent several more years in the employ of your Uncle Fred, and have truly grown to dread the annual cointoss sessions. [...] He makes you another offer. At the end of each year, he will divide your pension account into two equal parts and conduct a separate coin toss for each half [...] there are four possible outcomes [...] [...] Being handy with numbers, you calculate that your annualized return for this twocointoss sequence is 9.08, which is nearly a full percentage point higher than your previous expected return of 8.17 with only one coin toss. Even more amazingly, you realize that your risk has been reduced  with the addition of two returns at the mean of 10, your calculated standard deviation is now only 14.14, as opposed to 20 for the single coin toss. [...] Dividing your portfolio between assets with uncorrelated results increases return while decreasing risk. [...] If the second coin toss were perfectly inversely correlated with the first and always gave the opposite result [hence, outcomes 1 and 4 above never occurring], then our return would always be 10. In this case, we would have a 10 annualized longterm return with zero risk! I hope that summarizes the example well. Of course, in the real world, one of the tricks to building a good portfolio is finding assets that arent wellcorrelated, and if youre interested in more on the subject I suggest you check out his books including The Four Pillars of Investing and read more about Modern Portfolio Theory MPT."

So when their supplier raises the price that it charges the station the station typically raises its prices proportionality. The suppliers tend to have their own rates. The business needs to make a profit so the business sets the price where it feels it will make the most money. Some stations buy bargain gas. Many people say they find this gas to be just fine. Personally some stations gas seems to make my cars run much worse. I can say that my mileage can vary by as much as 4 miles to the gallon based on where I get my gas. So I pay more to go to those stations that consistently have provided me good gasoline. However higher prices do not necessarily mean better gas. We have a BP just down the street that seems to have bad gas while one about a half a mile away that I prefer because I have never had a bad tank of gas. Both are priced about the same.

Many lottery winners end up being poor in the long run because their behavior is the problem, not their finances.

Simply put, theres only two fundamental things that can be done You can do one or the other, or both. Over budgeting, I prefer automation  automate your bills and spending by setting up a bill and spending account and when the moneys gone, its gone you can tell yourself at that point, \"I have to find another source of income before I spend more\".

However, their cashflow is such that they can afford insurance.

However, here is another, smaller effect The typical flow of getting money from an ATM Suppose you have a minute to consider the offer, then in that time the currency may drop or rise which you can see from an external source of information. Therefore this opens a window for abuse. For real major currencies these huge switches are rare, but they do happen. And when 1 or 2 minor currencies are involved these switches are more common. Just looking at a random pair for today Botswana Pula to Haitian Gourde I immediately spotted a moment where the exchange rate jumped by more than 2 . This may not be the best example, but it shows why a large margin is desirable. Note that this argument only holds for when the customer knows in advance what the exchange rate would be, for cases where it is calculated afterwards I have not found any valid excuse for such large margins except that it allows them to offer other services at a lower price because these transaction."

    "content": "An asset allocation formula is useful because it provides a way to manage risk. Rebalancing preserves your asset allocation. The investment risk of a welldiversified portfolio with a few ETFs or mutual funds in there to get a wide range of stocks, bonds, and international exposure is mostly proportional to the asset class distribution. If you started out with halfstocks and halfbonds, and stocks surged 100 over the past few years while bonds have stayed flat, then you may be left with say 66 stocks and 33 bonds. Your portfolio is now more vulnerable to future stock market drops the risk associated with stocks. Most asset allocation recommendations are a little more specific than a stockbond split, but Im sure you can get the idea. Rebalancing can be profitable because its a formulaic way to enforce you to \"buy low, sell high\". Massive recessions notwithstanding, usually not everything in your portfolio will rise and fall at the same time, and some are actually negatively correlated thats one idea behind diversification, anyway. If your stocks have surged, chances are that bonds are cheaper. This doesnt always work repeatedly transferring money from bonds into stocks while the market was falling in 20082009 could have lost you even more money. Also, if you rebalance frequently, you might incur expenses from the trading depending on what sort of financial instrument youre holding. It may be more effective to simply channel new money into the sector that youre light on, and limit the major rebalancing of the portfolio so that its just an occasional thing.

    "content": "So, the priceearnings ratio is price over earnings, easy enough. But obviously earnings are not static. In the case of a growing company, the earnings will be higher in the future. There will be extra earnings, above and beyond what the stock has right now. You should consider the future earnings in your estimate of what the company is worth now. One snag Those extra earnings are future money. Futuremoney is an interesting thing, its actually worth less than presentmoney because of things like inflation, but also opportunity cost. So if you bought 100 in money that youll have 20 years from now, youd expect to pay less than 100. The US government can sell you that money. Its called a Series EE Savings Bond and it would cost you 50. I think. Dont quote me on that, though, ask the Treasury. So you cant compare future money with presentmoney directly, and you cant just add those dollars to the earnings . You need to compute a discount. Thats what discounted cashflow analysis is about figuring out the future cash flow, and then discounting the future figuring out what its worth now. The actual way you use the discount rate in your formula is a little scarier than simple division, though, because it involves discounting each years earnings in this case, someone has asserted a discount of 11 a year, and five years of earnings growth of 10. Wikipedia gives us the formula for the value of the future cash flow essentially adding all the future cash flows together, and then discounting them by a compounded rate.

Mostly towards corporations, but sometimes even the normal people, not only the \"Corporation are people, my friend\" M. Romney get some discounts. The tax deduction on mortgage interest comes as a tool to encourage Americans to own their homes. It is important, socially, for people to own their home to be independent, and in general contributes to the stability of the society. As anything, when taken to the extreme, it in fact achieves exactly the opposite, as weve seen in 2008, but when balanced  works well. Capital gain is taxed in the US, because it is income. Generally, any income is taxed. However, gain sourced from the sale of primary residence is excluded, up to a certain quite large amount from this tax if lived in the residence long enough  3 of the last 5 years prior to sale. This, again, to encourage Americans to upgrade their houses and make it easier for Americans to relocate when needed sell one house and buy another without losing cash on taxes. As to \"asset producing income\"  that is true in the US as well. You cannot deduct your personal expenses, in general. Mortgage interest on primary residence is a notable exception, because it serves a social cause. Similarly, medical expenses are allowed as a deduction, if theyre above certain limit, and many other things for example  if a US person totals his car, and insurance doesnt cover the loss  it is tax deductible, above certain limit, the higher the income  the higher the limit. These are purely social policy breaks. Socialism, something Americans like to have, and love to hate. Many \"antisocialists\" in the US are in fact taking advantage of these specific tax breaks the most, because for rich folks these are limited or nonexistent mortgage interest limited up to 1 million, medical expenses are allowed only above certain percentage of income, etc."

    "topic": "What happens if I just dont pay my student loans?",
    "content": "Let me give you some advice from someone who has experience at both ends  had student loan issues myself and parents ran financial aid department at local university. Quick story of my student loan. I graduated in debt and could not pay at first due to having kids way too early. I deferred. Schools will have rules for deference. There are also federal guidelines  lets not get specific on this though since these change every year it seems. So basically there is an initial deferment period in which any student can request for the repayments to be deferred and it is granted. Then there is an extended deferment. Here someone has to OK it. This is really rather arbitrary and up to the schoollender. My school decided to not extend mine after I filled out a mound of paperwork and showed that even without paying I had basically 200 a month for the family to live off past housingfixed expenses. Eventually they had to cave, because I had no money so they gave me an extended deferment. After the 5 years I started paying. Since my school had a very complex way to pay, I decided to give them 6 months at a time. You would think they would love that right? On the check it was clearly stated what months I was paying for to show that I was not prepaying the loan off Well I was in collections 4 months later. Their billing messed up, set me up for prepayment. They then played dumb and acted like I didnt but I had a picture of the check and their banks stamp on the back... They couldnt get my loan out of collections  even though they messed up. This is probably some lower level employee trying to cover their mistake. So this office tells creditors to leave me alone but I also CANNOT pay my loan because the credit collection agency has slapped a 5k fee on the 7k loan. So my loan spent 5 years kid you not like this. It was interest free since the employee stopped the loan processing. Point being is that if you dont pay the lender will either put your loan into deferment automatically or go after you. MOST not all schools will opt for deferment, which I believe is 2 years at most places. Then after that you have the optional deferment. So if you keep not paying they might throw you into that bucket. However if you stop paying and you never communicate with them the chances of you getting the optional deferment are almost none  unless school doesnt know where you live. Basically if you dont respond to their mailemails you get swept into their credit collection process. So just filling out the deferment stuff when you get it  even if they deny it  could buy you up to 10 years  kid you not. Now once you go into the collection process... anything is game. As long as you dont need a homecar loan you can play this game. What the collection agency does depends on size of loan and the rules. If you are at a \"major\" university the rules are usually more lax, but if you are at the smaller schools, especially the advertised tradeonline schools boom  better watch out. Wages will be garnished very soon. Expect to go to court, might have to hire an attorney because some corrupt lenders start smacking on fees  think of the 5k mine smacked on me. So the moral of the story is you will pay it off. If you act nice, fill out paperwork, talk to school, and so on you can probably push this off quite a few years. But you are still paying and you will pay interest on everything. So factor in that to the equation. I had a 2.3 loan but they are much higher now. Defaulting isnt always a bad thing. If you dont have the money then you dont have it. And using credit cards to help is not the thing to do. But you need to try to work with the school so you dont incur penaltiesfees and so that your job doesnt have creditors calling them. My story ended year 4 that my loan was in collection. A higher up was reviewing my case and called me. Told her the story and emailed her a picture of their cashed check. She was completely embarrassed when she was trying to work out a plan for me and I am like  how about I come down tomorrow with the 7k. But even though lender admitted fault this took 20 calls to agencies to clear up my credit so I could buy a house. So your goal should be"

    "content": "There are no guarantees in the stock market. The index fund can send you a prospectus which shows what their results have been over the past decade or so, or you can find that info on line, but \"past results are not a guarantee of future performance\". Returns and risk generally trade off against each other trying for higher than average results requires accepting higher than usual risk, and you need to decide which types of investments, in what mix, balance those in a way you are comfortable with. Reinvested dividends are exactly the same concept as compounded interest in a bank account. That is, you get the chance to earn interest on the interest, and then interest on the interest on the interest its a slow exponential growth curve, not just linear. Note that this applies to any reinvestment of gains, not just automatic reinvestment back into the same fund  but automatic reinvestment is very convenient as a default. This is separate from increase in value due to growth in value of the companies. Yes, you will get a yearly report with the results, including the numbers needed for your tax return. You will owe income tax on any dividends or sales of shares. Unless the fund is inside a 401k or IRA, its just normal property and you can sell or buy shares at any time and in any amount. Of course the advantage of investing through those special retirement accounts is advantageous tax treatment, which is why they have penalties if you use the money before retirement. Re predicting results Guesswork and rule of thumb and hope that past trends continue a bit longer. Really the right answer is not to try to predict precise numbers, but to make a moderately conservative guess, hope you do at least that well, and be delighted if you do better... And to understand that you can lose value, and that losses often correct themselves if you can avoid having to sell until prices have recovered. You can, of course, compute historical results exactly, since you know how much you put in when, how much you took out when, and how much is in the account now. You can either look at how rate of return varied over time, or just compute an average rate of return both approaches can be useful when trying to compare one fund against another... I get an approximate version of this reported by my financial management software, but mostly ignore it except for amusement and to reassure myself that things are behaving approximately as expected. As long as Im outperforming what I need to hit my retirement goals, Im happy enough and unwilling to spend much more time on it... and my plans were based on fairly conservative assumptions. If you invest 3k, it grows at whatever rate it grows, and ten years later you have 3kX. If you then invest another 10k, you now have 3kX10k, all of which grows at whatever rate the fund now grows. When you go to sell shares or fractional shares, your profit has to be calculated based on when those specific shares were purchased and how much you paid for them versus when they were sold and how much you sold them for this is a more annoying bit of record keeping and accounting than just reporting bank account interest, but manymost brokerages and investment banks will now do that work for you and report it at the end of the year for your taxes, as I mentioned."

For a total return ETF, the situation is even more limiting income can only be funded by liquidation.

    "content": "In 2014 the IRS announced that it published guidance in Notice 201421. In that notice, the answer to the first question describes the general tax treatment of virtual currency For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. As its property like any other, capital gains if and when you sell are taxed. As with any capital gains, youre taxed on the \"profit\" you made, that is the \"proceeds\" how much you got when you sold minus your \"basis\" how much you paid to get the property that you sold. Until you sell, its just an asset like a house, or a share of stock, or a rare collectible card that doesnt require any reporting. If your initial cryptocurrency acquisition was through mining, then this section of that Notice applies Q8 Does a taxpayer who mines virtual currency for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities? A8 Yes, when a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income. That is to say, when it was mined the market value of the amount generated should have been included in income probably on either Line 21 Other Income, or on Schedule C if its from your own business. At that point, the market value would also qualify as your basis. Though I doubt thered be a whole lot of enforcement action for not amending your 2011 return to include 0.75. Technically if you find a dollar bill on the street it should be included in income, but usually the government cares about bigger fish than that. It sounds like your basis is close enough to zero that its not worth trying to calculate a more accurate value. Since your basis couldnt be less than zero, theres no way that using zero as your basis would cause you to pay less tax than you ought, so the government wont have any objections to it. One thing to be careful of is to document that your holdings qualify for longterm capital gains treatment held longer than a year if applicable. Also, as youre trading in multiple cryptocurrencies, each transaction may count as a \"sale\" of one kind followed by a \"purchase\" of the other kind, much like if you traded your Apple stock for Google stock. Its possible that \"1031 like kind exchange\" rules apply, and in June 2016 the American Institute of CPAs sent a letter asking about it among other things, but as far as I know theres been no official IRS guidance on the matter. There are also some related questions here see \"Do altcoin trades count as likekind exchanges?\" and \"Assuming 1031 Doesnt Apply To Cryptocurrency Trading\". But if in fact those exchange rules do not apply and it is just considered a sale followed by a purchase, then you would need to report each exchange as a sale with that assets basis probably 0 for the initial one, and proceeds of the fair market value at the time, and then that same value would be the basis of the new asset youre purchasing. Using a 0 basis is how I treat my bitcoin sales, though I havent dealt with other cryptocurrencies. As long as all the USD income is being reported when you get USD, I find it unlikely youll run into a lot of trouble, even if you technically were supposed to report the individual transactions when they happened. Though, Im not in charge of IRS enforcement, and Im not aware of any highprofile cases, so its hard to know anything for sure. Obviously, if theres a lot of money involved, you may want to involve a professional rather than random strangers on the Internet. You could also try contacting the IRS directly, as believeitornot, their job is in fact helping you to comply with the tax laws correctly. Also, there are phone numbers at the end of Notice 201421 of people which might be able to provide further guidance, including this statement The principal author of this notice is Keith A.

All of these states had issued debt to invest in banks. From the detailed source listed below \"...it should be remembered that all cases of state debt repudiation, as contrasted with mere default, involved banks.\" Jackson had killed the federal central bank 10 years earlier and the states were trying to create their own inflationary central banks. Six other states delayed debt payments from three to six years source, page 103, this source has more details. This is the only case I know of where US states defaulted. US cities default more frequently. Im very confused do US single states like IOWA have debt and emits obligations on their own like Italy does in EU? Yes. Individual states can issue their own bonds. Oh, and just another little thing I would like to know, is Dollar a fiat currency too like the Euro? Yes, the US dollar is a fiat currency.

Many data providers will give you a time series for the \"prompt\" contract history, which will automatically roll to the next expiring contract for you. Some even provide 2nd prompt, etc. time series. If that is not available, youd have to query multiple futures contracts and interleave them based on the expiry rules, which should be publicly available. Also is there not a price difference from the contract which is expiring and the one that is being rolled forward to? Yes, since the time to delivery is extended by 30 days when you roll to the next contract. but yet there are no sudden price discontinuities in the charts. Well, there are, but it could be indistinguishable from the normal volatility of the time series."

    "topic": "How do you report Scorporation Shareholder loans  capital contributions?",
    "content": "As the owner of the Scorp, it is far easier for you to move money inout of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company. Loans require interest payments, 1099INT forms, and have tax consequences, whereas the distributions dont need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed. If you were paid interest, disregard this answer. I dont know if or how you could recategorize the loan once theres a 1099INT involved. If no interest was ever paid, you just need to account for it properly If the company didnt pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099INT form i.e. you wrote a check to the company, no promissory note, no tax forms, no payments, no interest, etc. then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution. You can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the IRS. In Quickbooks, create the following Equity accounts  one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions When putting money into the company, deposit into your corporate bank account and use the Capital Contribution equity account. When taking money out of the company, write yourself a check and use the Distributions account. At the end of every tax year, you can close out your Contributions and Distributions to Retained Earnings by making a general journal entry. For example, debit retained earnings and credit distributions on Dec 31 every year to zeroout the distributions account. For contributions, do the reverse and credit retained earnings. There are other ways of recording these transactions  for example I think some people just use a Member Capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions  and QB might warn you about posting journal entries to the special Retained Earnings account at the end of the year. In any case, this is how my CPA set up my books and its been working well enough for many years. Still, never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your CPA. Be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary, you cant get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits  thats a big red flag that can trigger an audit. If youre simply distributing back the money you already put into the company, that should be fine."

The company accounts must reflect a credit the amount you lend to it and a debit what it then puts that loan towards. Its fairly normal for a smallish ownerdriven company to reflect a large loanaccount for the owners. For example, if you have a room at home dedicated for the business it is impractical to pay rent directly via the company. The rental agreement is probably in your name, you pay the rent, and you reconcile it with the company later. You could even charge your company taxable interest on this loan. When you draw down the loan from the company you reverse this, debit your loan account and credit the company paying off the debt. As far as tracking that expenditure, simply handle those thirdparty invoices in the normal way and file them for reference."

There are some really smart people on here, when placed in your exact situation, would do completely different things. Personal finance is overall, personal. If it was me, Id never borrow money in retirement. If I had the cash, Id use it to help fund the purchase. If I didnt, I simply wouldnt. For me wealth retention in your case is surprisingly more about behavior than math even though I am a math guy. You are simply creating a great deal of risk at a season in your life with a diminished ability to recover from negative events. In my opinion you are inviting \"tales of woe\" to be part of your future if you borrow. Others would disagree with me. They would point to the math and show how you would be much better off on borrowing instead of pulling out of investments provided a sufficient return on your nest egg. They may even have a case as you might have to pay taxes on money pulled out magnifying the difference in net income on borrowing versus pulling out in a lump sum. Here in the US, the money you pulled out would be taxed at the highest marginal rate. To help with a down payment of 50K, you might have to pull out 66,500 to pay the taxes and have enough for the down payment. The third option is to not help with a down payment or to help them in a different way. Perhaps giving them a few hundred per month for two years to help with their mortgage payment. Maybe watch their kids some to reduce day care costs or help with home improvements so they can buy a lower price home. Those are all viable options. Perhaps the child is not ready to buy a home. Having said all that it really depends on your situation. Say your sitting on 5 million in investments, your pensions is sufficient to have some disposable income, and they are asking for a relatively small amount. Then pull the money out and dont be concerned. You nest egg will quickly recover the money."

Reminder Most renovations do NOT pay for themselves in increased sales price, not least because youll lose the buyers who dont like what youve done but would have been happy to renovate it themselves to their own tastes. Unless there is something which will actively impair your ability to sell the house, you should usually renovate when you plan to stay there for a while and take your returns in enjoying the house more, NOT on the way out. Theres been some recent discussion of this over in Home Improvement, pointing out that the changes which return more than they cost are usually simple things like refreshing the paint, \"staging\" the house so it looks lived in but not cluttered, replacing damaged blinds, washing windows, putting out a few more flowers, and so on."

While this does not show the costs of your total mortgage, it does help you get an idea of just how much the 40k in question is costing you in interest. If you hover over the month one year from now you will see that you will have paid around 1587 in interest over the course of the year. If you were to put the full 40k toward your mortgage right now, you would avoid having to pay this interest over the next year. The next question I think you would have to ask yourself is if there is anything else you could do with that money that is worth more than the 1587 to you. Is it worth 1587 to keep those funds liquidavailable in case you need to use them for something else? Could you find other investments you feel comfortable with that could earn you more than 1587? Is it worth the hasslerisk of investing the funds somewhere else with a better return? If you cant come up with anything better to do with the money then yes, you should probably use the funds or at least part of them towards the mortgage."

    "topic": "The spread goes to the market maker, is the market maker the exchange?",
    "content": "A \"market maker\" is someone that is contractually bound, by the exchange, to provide both bid and ask prices for a given volume e.g. 5000 shares. A single market maker usually covers many stocks, and a single stock is usually covered by many market makers. The NYSE has \"specialists\" that are market makers that also performed a few other roles in the management of trading for a stock, and usually a single issue on the NYSE is covered by only one market maker. Market makers are often middlemen between brokers ignoring stuff like dark pools, and the fact that brokers will often trade stocks internally among their own clients before going to the exchange. Historically, the market makers gave up buysell discretion in exchange for being the \"goto guys\" for anyone wanting to trade in that stock. When you told your broker to buy a stock for you, he didnt hook you up with another retail investor he went to the market maker. Market makers would also sometimes find investors willing to step in when more liquidity was needed for a security. They were like other floor traders they hung out on the exchange floors and interacted with traders to buy and sell stocks. Traders came to them when they wanted to buy one of the specialists issues. There was no public order book just ticker tape and a quote. It was up to the market maker to maintain that order book. Since they are effectively forbidden from being onesided traders in a security, their profit comes from the bidask spread. Being the counterparty to almost every trade, theyd make profit from always selling above where they were buying. Except when the price moved quickly  the downside to this arrangement. \"The spread goes to the market maker\" is just stating that the profit implicit in the spread gets consumed by the market maker. With the switch to ECNs, the role of the market maker has changed. For example, ForEx trading firms tend to act as market makers to their customers. On ECNs, the invisible, anonymous guy at the other end of most trades is often a market maker, still performing his traditional role. Yet brokers can interact directly with each other now, rather than relying on the market makers book. With modern online investing and public order books, retail investors might even be trading directly with each other. Market makers are still out there in part, they perform a service sold by an Exchange to the companies that choose to be listed on that exchange. That service has changed to helping tamp volatility during normal highvolatility periods such as at open and close."

    "topic": "What is the daily rebalanced leverage ratio that is ideal for the SP 500 based on past performance?",
    "content": "The reason that UltraLong funds and the like are bad isnt because of the leverage ratio. Its because theyre compounded daily, and the product of all the doubled daily returns is not mathematically equivalent to the double the longterm return. Id consider providing big fancy equations using uppercase pi as the product of elements in a sequence operator and other calculus fanciness, but that would be overkill, I dont think I can do TeX here, and I dont know the relevant TeX anyway. Anyway. From the economics theory perspective, the ideal leverage ratio is 1X  that is, unlevered, straight investment. Consider Using leverage costs money. You know that, surely. If someone could borrow money at N and invest at an expected NX, where X  0, then they would. They would borrow all the money they could and buy all the SP500 they could. But when they bought all that SP500, theyd eventually run out of people who were willing to sell it for that cheap. That would mean the excess return would be smaller. Eventually youd get to a point where the excess return is... zero? .... well, no, empirically, we can see that its definitely not zero, and that in the real world that stocks do return more than bonds. Why? Because stocks are riskier than bonds. The difference in expected return between an index like the SP500 and a US Treasury bond is due to the relative riskiness of the SP500, which isnt guaranteed by the US Government to return your principal. Any money that you make off of leverage comes from assuming some sort of a risk. Now, assuming risk can be a profitable thing to do, but there are also a lot of people out there with higher risk tolerance than you, like insurance companies and billionaires, so the market isnt exactly short of people willing to take risks, and you shouldnt expect the returns of \"assuming risk\" in the general case to be qualitatively awesome. Now, its true that investing in an unlevered fashion is risky also. But thats not an excuse to go leveraged anyway its a reason to hold back. In fact, regular stocks are sufficiently risky that most people probably shouldnt be holding a 100 stock portfolio. They should be tempering that risk with bonds, instead, and increasing the size of their bond holdings over time. The appropriate time to use leverage is when you have information which limits your risk. You have done research, and have reason to believe that you understand the future of an individual stockindex better than the rest of the stock market does. You calculate that the potential for achieving returns with leverage outweighs the risks. Then you dump your money into the leveraged position. In exchange for this, the market receives information about anticipated future returns of this instrument, because of the price movement which occurs as a result of someone putting his money where his mouth is. If youre just looking to dump money into broad market indicies in a leveraged fashion, youre doing it wrong. There is no free money. Ed. Which is not to say theres not money. Theres lots of money. But if you go looking for the free kind, you wont find it, and may end up with money that you thought was free but was actually quite expensive. Edit. Okay, so you dont like my answer. Im not surprised. Im giving you a real answer instead of a \"make free money\" answer. Okay. Heres your \"how to make free money\" answer. Assume you are using a constant leverage ratio over the length of time youve invested your money, and you dont get to just jump into and out of the market thats markettiming, not leverage so you have to stay invested. Youre going to have a scenario which falls into one of these categories The SP500 historically rises over time. The average rate of return probably exceeds the average interest rate. So the ideal leverage ratio is infinite. Of course, this is a stupid answer in real life because you cant pull that off. Your risk tolerance is too low and you will have trouble finding a lender willing to lend you unsecured money, and youll probably lose all your money in a crash sooner or later. Ultimately its a stupid answer because youre asking the wrong question. You should probably ask a better question \"when I use leverage to gain additional exposure to risk, am I being properly compensated for assuming that risk?\""

In scenario 2 youve spent 40000 400010 and dont have to pay any more, but you currently have 35000 40000  5000 less than you did in scenario 1.

A more realistic one would be 0.5, depending on the terms. As has been mentioned, CDs are good when you need to preserve your capital. What might be a situation for that? They are great for Emergency funds, which you should always have a reasonable amount of cash in. I have a set up 3 CDs with 12 month terms, each carrying about 30 of my emergency savings. The remaining 10 I keep in a standard savings account, for quick access dealing with a short term emergency. The 3 are spaced about 4 months apart, so that Im always within 4 months of having one come to term. They have a 3 month penalty if I withdraw early, but based on the fact that I have never had to touch more than 10 of my emergency savings, Im perfectly okay with that. What about more long term savings? Well, it depends on what your timeframe is for using the money. If its more than 10 years, and you are willing to risk losing some of it, then by all means invest in a higher risk higher reward investment.

    "topic": "Shorting versus selling to hedge risk",
    "content": "Its not quite identical, due to fees, stock rights, and reporting  tax obligations. But the primary difference is that a person could have voting rights in a company while maintaining zero economic exposure to the company, sometimes known as empty voting. As an abstract matter, its identical in that you reduce your financial exposure whether you sell your stock or short it. So the essence of your question is fundamentally true. But the details make it different. Of course there are fee differences in how your broker will handle it, and also margin requirements for shorting. Somebody playing games with overlapping features of ownership, sales, and purchases, may have tax and reporting obligations for straddles, wash sales, and related issues. A straight sale is generally less complicated for tax reporting purposes, and a loss is more likely to be respected than someone playing games with sales and purchases. But the empty voting issue is an important difference. You could buy stock with rights such as voting, engage in other behavior such as forwards, shorts, or options to negate your economic exposure to the stock, while maintaining the right to vote. Of course in some cases this may have to be disclosed or may be covered by contract, and most people engaging in stock trades are unlikely to have meaningful voting power in a public company. But the principle is still there. As explained in the article by Henry Hu and Bernie Black Hedge funds have been especially creative in decoupling voting rights from economic ownership. Sometimes they hold more votes than economic ownership  a pattern we call empty voting. In an extreme situation, a vote holder can have a negative economic interest and, thus, an incentive to vote in ways that reduce the companys share price. Sometimes investors hold more economic ownership than votes, though often with morphable voting rights  the de facto ability to acquire the votes if needed. We call this situation hidden morphable ownership because the economic ownership and de facto voting ownership are often not disclosed."

Equities compound dividends too, and the best place to invest is in diversified stock indices such as the SP500, FTSE100, DOW30 or indicesfunds which pay dividends. The best way to capture returns is to dollar cost average e.g. place a lump sum, then add x every month, to reinvest dividends, and oh, to forget about it in an IRA or SIPP Self invested pension or other vehicle which discourages tampering with your investment. Yes, values rise and fall but we humans are so short sighted, if we had bought the SP in 2007 and sold in 2009 in fear, we would have missed out on the 25 gain excluding dividends from 20072014. Thats about 3 a year gain even if you bought the 2007 high beating cash or bonds even after the financial crisis.

    "content": "Yes, it does matter very much. Theres a thing called fungible instruments. These are the instruments where it doesnt matter. E.g. most options I ever dealt with in the US are fungible no matter which US exchange you trade them on. A fungible instrument is an instrument where you buy 1 lot on exchange A, then sell 1 lot on exchange B, and as a result you have 0 lots. With another instrument, you can buy 1 lot on exchange A, sell 1 lot on exchange B, and even tough they are the exact same thing, you now own 1, and owe 1  they dont cancel each other out. Other than that, in different countries there are obviously different laws and regulations. For a small at home trader who just gambles for fun and isnt interested in negative positions sell what you dont have, there isnt much of a difference . I think thats what the other answers are saying."

Without more credit here are the things he cant have The key to illustrate is that all the money he makes, for the next several years is obligated to the people he has already borrowed it from. Try to have him imagine giving his entire paycheck to a bank, and then doing that for the next five years. To drive it home, point out that there are 5 super bowls, 5 college championship games, 5 final fours, 5 annual concerts he likes, 5 model years of cars, 5 or more iPhone versions in those five years. Or whatever he is into. 5 years of laptops, 5 years of fishing trips. These things are not affordable to him right now. He has already spent his money for the next 5 years, and those are the things he cannot have because he is, in fact, out of cash. Furthermore, if he continues, the credit will dry up completely and his 5 year horizon could easily become ten. To illustrate how long 5 or 10 years is, have him remember that 10 years ago he might have been in college or the military. That 5 years ago Facebook was no big thing. That 5 years ago the Razr was an awesome phone. That 5 years ago we had a different president."

The renter  buyer will often pay extra rent in addition to market rent. Many times this additional rent is contracted to be applied to the purchase price of the home. The risks to the renterbuyer are as follows Also, something to note Many people will recommend that you use the additional rents to be applied specifically towards the downpayment. Be wary of this. There are no institutional lenders available today that will allow the additional rent money to be applied towards your downpayment. That means you must come up with the downpayment in cash before closing. The additional rent payments can be used towards the price. Hope that helps. Good luck!"

Shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock, carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity.

    "content": "Robert is right saying that options prices are affected by implied volatility but is wrong saying that you have to look at the VIX index. For two reasons 1 the VIX index is for SP500 options only. If you are trading other options, it is less useful. 2 if you are trading an option that is not at the money, your implied volatility may be very different and follow a different dynamics that the VIX index. So please look at the right implied volatility. In terms of strategy, I dont think that not doing anything is a good strategy. I accept any point of view but you should consider that option traders should be able to adjust positions depending on market view. So you are long 1 call, suppose strike 10. Suppose the underlying price at the time of entry was 10 so the call was at the money. Now its 9. 1 you still have a bullish view buy 1 call strike 9 and sell 2 calls strike 10. This way you have a bull call spread with much higher probability of leading to profit. You are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations. 2 you become bearish you can sell 1 call strike 9. This way you end up with a bear call spread. Again, you are limiting your profit potential but you are also reducing the costs and managing the greeks in a proper way and in line with your expectations. 3 you become neutral buy 1 call strike 8 and sell 2 calls strike 9. This way you end up with a call butterfly. You are almost delta neutral and you can wait until your view becomes clear enough to become directional. At that point you can modify the butterfly to make it directional. These are just some opportunities you have. There is no reason for you to wait. Options are eroding contracts and you must be fast and adjust the position before time starts eroding your capital at risk. Its true that buying a call doesnt make you loose more than the premium you paid, but its better to reduce this premium further with some adjustment. Isnt it? Hope that helps. "

    "topic": "Is candlestick charting an effective trading tool in timing the markets?",
    "content": "From what I have read from ONeil to Van Tharp, etc, etc, no one can pick winners more than 75 of the time regardless of the system they use and most traders consider themselves successful if 60 of the trades are winners and 40 are losers. So I am on the side that the chart is only a reflection of the past and cannot tell you reliably what will happen in the future. It is difficult to realize this but here is a simple way for you to realize it. If you look at a daily chart and lets say it is 930 am at the open and you ask a person to look at the technical indicators, look at the fundamentals and decide the direction of the market by drawing the graph, just for the next hour. He will realize in just a few seconds that he will say to him or her self \"How on earth do you expect me to be able to do that?\" He will realize very quickly that it is impossible to tell the direction of the market and he realizes it would be foolhardy to even try. Because Mickey Mantle hit over 250 every year of his career for the first 15 years it would be a prudent bet to bet that he could do it again over the span of a season, but you would be a fool to try to guess if the next pitch would be a ball or a strike. You would be correct about 50 of the time and wrong about 50 of the time. You can rely on LARGER PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR OVER YEARS, but short hourly or even minute by minute prediction is foolish. That is why to be a trader you have to keep on trading and if you keep on trading and cut your losses to 12 of your wins you will eventually have a wonderful profit. But you have to limit your risk on any one trade to 1 of your portfolio. In that way you will be able to trade at least 100 times. do the math. trade a hundred times. lose 5 and the next bet gain 10. Keep on doing it. You will have losses sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row and also wins sometimes of 3 or 4 in a row but overall if you keep on trading even the best traders are generally only \"right\" 60 of the time. So lets do the math. If you took 100 dollars and make 100 trades and the first trade you made 10 and reinvested the total and the second trade you lost 5 of that and continue that winloss sequence for 100 trades you would have 1284 dollars minus commissions. That is a 1200 return in one hundred trades. If you do it in a roth IRA you pay no taxes on the short term gains. It is not difficult to realize that the stock market DOES TREND. And the easiest way to make 10 quickly is to in general trade 3x leveraged funds or stocks that have at least 3 beta from the general index. Take any trend up and count the number of days the stock is up and it is usually 6675 and take any down trend and it is down 6675 of the days. So if you bet on the the beginning of a day when the stock was up and if you buy the next day about 6675 of the time the stock will also be up. So the idea is to realize that 13 of the time at least you will cut your losses but 23 of the time you will be up then next day as well. So keep holding the position based on the low of the previous day and as the stock rises to your trend line then tighten the stock to the low of the same day or just take your profit and buy something else. But losing 13 times is just part of \"the unpredictable\" nature of the stock market which is causes simply because there are three types of traders all betting at the same time on the same stock. Day traders who are trading from 1 to 10 times a day, swing traders trading from 1 day to several weeks and buy and hold investors holding out for long term capital gains. They each have different price targets and time horizons and THAT DIFFERENCE is what makes the market move. ONE PERSONS SHORT TERM EXIT PRICE AT A PROFIT IS ANOTHER PERSONS LONG TERM ENTRY POINT and because so many are playing at the same time with different time horizons, stop losses and exit targets it is impossible to draw the price action or volume. But it is possible to cut your losses and ride your winners and if you keep on doing that you have a very fine return indeed."

One reason for this the Social Insurance Number SIN number isnt used for so many purposes like the Social Security Number SSN in the US. The SIN number isnt even required to get credit but with some exceptions it is needed to open an interestbearing savings account, so that the interest income can be reported. You can refuse to provide the SIN number to most private companies. Canada also has one of the highest percapita immigration rates of any large country, so new arrivals are expected, and services are geared up for them. Most of the banks offer special deals for \"New Canadians\". You should get a credit card even if just a secured credit card through them with one of these offers to start a credit file anyway, but theres no need to actually use it much. Autopaying a utility bill through the card, and paying it off in full each month, is one way to keep it active. No need to ever pay any interest. Most major apartment rental firms will expect a good proportion of their renters to be new to Canada, so should have procedures in place to deal with it such as a higher deposit. You should not give them your SIN for a credit check, even when youre more established. Same for utilities, they can just charge a higher deposit if they cant credit check you. For private landlords, everything is negotiable but see the laws link at the end of this answer. You will later need a credit rating for a mortgage on a house if not paying cash, so its worth getting that one token credit card. Useful for car rental also. Heres a fairly complete summary of the laws on renting in Canada, which includes the maximum deposits that can be asked for, and notice periods."

So if you are thinking about investing in some areas with high risk and high potential reward e.g. emerging market stocks then the Roth IRA might be the place to do it. That way, if the investment works out, you have more money in the account that wont ever be taxed. We can talk about the possible risks of certain kinds of investments, but this is not an appropriate forum to recommend for or against them specifically. Healthcare stocks are subject to political risk in the current regulatory climate. BRICs are subject to political risks regarding the political and business climate in the relevant nations, and the growth of their economies need not correspond with growth in the companies you hold in your portfolio. Energy stocks are subject to the world economic climate and demand for oil, unless youre talking alternativeenergy stocks, which are subject to political risk regarding their subsidies and technological risk regarding whether or not their technologies pan out.

But it can also be the other way around, that the ADR serves a smaller market than the home market. I would go for the largest market, with the most volume so its quicker and cheaper to buysell. Often ADR has less shares, meaning that the availability is lower and the prices higher more expensive. This is often the case with Asian stocks where governments try to limit their companys exposure to foreigners. As a general rule I would buy the home stock instead of ADR.

    "topic": "Why do stocks go up? Is it due to companies performing well, or what else? [duplicate]",
    "content": "Prices can go up or down for a variety of reasons. If interest rates decline typically every stock goes up, and vice versa. Ultimately, there are two main valuerelated factors to a price of a stock the dividends the company may issue or the payoff in the event the company is bought by someone else. Any dividend paid will give concrete value to a stock. For example, imagine a company has shares selling at 1.00 and they announce that they will pay a dividend at the end of the year of 1.00 per share. If their claim is believable then the stock is practically FREE at 1.00 a share, so in all likelihood the stock will go up a lot, just on the basis of the dividend alone. If a company is bought by another, they need to buy at least a majority of the shares, and in some cases all the shares. Since the price the buyer will be willing to pay for the company is related to its potential future income for the buyer, the more profitable the company is, the more a buyer will be willing to pay and hence the greater the value of the stock."

In technical analysis of stock charts, various short and long term moving averages are used to give an indication of the trend of the stock in the short and long term, as compared to the current price. I would prefer to use the term moving average MA rather than average as the MA is recalculated every day or at appropriate frequencies for your data on the period you are using. I would also expand on the term \"moving average\". There are two that are commonly used Going back to the question, of the value of this number, For example if the current price is above the 200 day EWMA and also above the 30 day EWMA, then the stock is broadly trending upwards. Conversely if current price is below the 200 day EWMA and also below the 30 day EWMA, then the stock is broadly trending downwards. These numbers are chosen on the basis of the market you are trading in, the volatility and other factors. For another example of how a number of moving averages are used together, please have a read of Daryl Guppys Multiple Moving Average, though this does not use moving averages as large as 200 days."

Its better to use a spreadsheet with this capability such as OpenOffices Calc. The average return on equity is 9, so anything higher than that is a rational choice. Example Using this simple tool, the formula variables can easily be input. For instance, the first year has a presumed cash inflow of 2,460 because the insurance has a 30 discount from 8,200 that is assumed to be otherwise paid, a cash inflow of 40,000 to finance the sprinklers, a cash outflow of 40,000 to fund the sprinklers, a 400 outflow for inspection, and an outflow in the amount of the first years interest on the loan.

    "content": "Because an equity option can be constructed at essentially any price by two willing counterparties on an exchange, there are not enough ISINs to represent the entire i.e. infinite option chain for even a single stock on a single expiration date. As a result, ISINs are not generated for each individual possible options contract. Instead the ISIN is used only to refer to the \"underlying\" symbol, and a separate formula is used to refer to the specific option contract for that symbol So that code you pasted is not an ISIN but rather the standard US equity option naming scheme that you need to provide in addition to the ISIN when talking to your broker. Note that ISINs and formulas for referring to option contracts in other countries can behave quite differently. Also, there are many countries and markets that dont need ISINs because the products in question only exist on a single exchange. In those cases the exchange is pretty much free to make up whatever ID scheme it wants. P.S. Now Im curious how option chains are identified for strike prices above 99,999.

    "topic": "Can an unmarried couple buy a home together with only one person on the mortgage?",
    "content": "I will expand on Bacons comment. When you are married, and you acquire any kind of property, you automatically get a legal agreement. In most states that property is owned jointly and while there are exceptions that is the case most of the time. When you are unmarried, there is no such assumption of joint acquisition. While words might be said differently between the two parties, if there is nothing written down and signed then courts will almost always assume that only one party owns the property. Now unmarried people go into business all the time, but they do so by creating legally binding agreements that cover contingencies. If you two do proceed with this plan, it is necessary to create those documents with the help of a lawyer. Although expensive paying for this protection is a small price in relation to what will probably be one of the largest purchases in your lives. However, I do not recommend this. If Clayton can and wants to buy a home he should. Emma can rent from Clayton. That rent could any amount the two agree on, including zero. If the two do get married, well then Emma will end up owning any equity after that date. If they stay together until death, it is likely that she or her heirs will own half of it anyway. Also if this house is sold, the equity pass into larger house they buy after marriage, then that will be owned jointly. If they do break up, the break up is clean and neat. Presumably she would have paid rent anyway, so nothing is lost. Many people run into trouble having to sell at a bad time in a relationship that coincides with a weak housing market. In that case, both parties lose. So much like Bacons advice I would not buy jointly. There is no upside, and you avoid a lot of downside. Dont play \"house\" by buying a home jointly when you are unmarried."

What you have been offered is the option to buy the company share at a given price 5 starting a given date your golden handcuffs aka vesting schedule. If the companys value doubles in 1 year and the shares are liquid i.e. you can sell them then youve just made 125k of profit. If the companys value has gone to zero in 1 year then youve lost nothing other than your hopes of getting rich. As others have mentioned, the mechanics of exercising the option and selling the shares can typically be accomplished without any cash involved. The broker will do both in a single transaction and use the proceeds of the sale to pay the cost of buying the shares. You should always at least cover the taxable portion of the transaction and typically the broker will withhold that tax anyways. Otherwise you could find yourself in a position where you have actually lost money due to tax being owed while the shares decline in value below that tax. You dont have to worry about that right now. Again as people have mentioned options will typically expire 10 years from vesting or 90 days from leaving your employment with the company. Im sure there are some variations on the theme. Make sure you ask and all this should be part of some written contract. Im sure you can ask to see it if you wish. Also typical is that stock option grants have to be approved by the board which is normally a technicality. Some general advice"

Needless to say, these algorithms are not perfect, although, thanks to financial pressure, they are improving.

Ultimately, this isnt against you. Ive been with the bank for 15 years and the money in the accounts has been very slowly accumulated via directdeposit paychecks over that time. From this I gather the most likely explanation, is that youve hit somekind of account threshold, that the average credithappy customers usually do not exceed, which triggered a routine checkup. How do you deal with it? Practice puppetry! There is only one way to survive angry customers emotionally you have to realize that theyre not angry at you theyre angry at your business, and you just happen to be a convenient representative of that business. And since theyre treating you like a puppet, an iconic standin for the real business, you need to treat yourself as a puppet, too. Pretend youre a puppeteer. The customer is yelling at the puppet. Theyre not yelling at you. Theyre angry with the puppet. Your job is to figure out, gosh, what can I make the puppet say that will make this person a happy customer? In an investigation case, go with boredom The puppet doesnt care, have no feelings, and is eternally patient. Figure out what are the most likely words that will have the matter \"mentally resolved\" from the investigators point of view, tell them what they have to hear, and youll have case closed in no time.

    "topic": "Advantages of Shareholder over Director in new Company",
    "content": "I dont know Australian law, but I will give my US perspective here. The custom in the US is for officers and directors to be indemnified by the corporation, and that LLCs have an even broader power to indemnify even to remove the duty of loyalty!. Moreover, directors will typically be able to purchase DO insurance to protect them from loss in the event of liability. For US corporations not LLCs, the duty of care prudence requires that directors behave responsibly in weighing major decisions, and consult experts and specialists before coming to rash decisions. It usually becomes a court case in the context of a large public company in the midst of an acquisition event. The only people with standing in the US are shareholders. If all the other shareholders are directors, then it may be hard for them to blame you. Additionally, if you are concerned about the propriety of your actions, there may be sources to rely on. First, discussion with your fellow directors can be a helpful guide though will not usually immunize you from any accusation of wrongdoing, and disclosure tends to cure almost any accusation of breaching the duty of loyalty. Second, boards often secure the advice of legal counsel, and sometimes bring on lawyers as members or will outright hire counsel for the board. Third, there may be services that will provide you with generic advice e.g. UK Companies House and USbased IOD, which might set you at ease a little bit. I dont know the details of Australian law, as I say. But my sense of common law countries is that, like the US, they are primarily concerned about negligence incompetently or imprudently neglecting to understand the business and make informed decisions, disloyalty fraudulently engaging in selfinterested transactions that either hurt the company or should have been offered to the company, and recklessness not bothering to seek out information. As long as you are active, informed, engaged, and not engaging in secret deals outside the company especially deals where either side is competing with the company, then that would be more than sufficient under the US standard. If you are concerned about liability, then inquire into indemnifications by the company in the US, the company can usually pay all legal costs of directors, insurance, and legal counsel. I imagine your business partners are no more savvy than you are. My impression is you are overreacting to relatively rare and exotic expression of corporate law at least in the US. But Ill close by repeating that I dont know Australian corporate law."

However, private insurance, a group employee plan or retiree health coverage also may be in effect. [...] In addition to Medicare, the person with dementia may qualify for a number of public programs. These programs provide income support or longterm care services to people who are eligible. This includes Social Social Security Disability Income SSDI for workers younger than 65, Supplemental Security Income SSI, Medicaid, veteran benefits, and tax deductions and credits.

    "topic": "Should I pay off my car loan within the year?",
    "content": "Something Id like to plant firmly into your mind  If youre able to save up enough money to buy the things you want outright, credit will be of little use to you. Many people find once theyve accumulated very good credit scores by use of good financial habits, that they rarely end up using credit, and get little out of having a great credit score compared to an average credit score. Of course, a lot of that would depend on your financial situation, but its something to keep in mind. As stated by others, and documented widely online, you dont need to make payments on a loan or carry a card balance to build your credit history. Check your credit on a popular site, such as Credit Karma No affiliation. There, youll see a detailed breakdown of the different areas of your credit profile that matter things like The best thing I could recommend is get a credit line or credit card, and use it responsibly. Carrying a balance will waste money on interest, much like the car payment. Just having it and not overusing it Or not using it at all will build your credit history. Of course, some institutions may close your account after X number of years of inactivity. With this in mind, Id say its safe to pay off the car loan. Read your agreement and make sure there arent early termination  early payment fees for this. Edit There have been notes in the comments sections of questionanswers here about concerns with getting apartment. My two cents here Most apartments Ive seen check your credit for negative marks. Having no credit history, and thus never missing a payment or having a judgement made against you, will likely be enough to get you into most normalquality apartments, assuming the rest of your application  profile is in order, like  Good references, if asked for them  At least 2.5x rent payment in gross income etc, things like that. If they really think youre a risk, they may ask for a larger deposit Though Im sure in some areas there may be restrictions on whether they can do this, or how much they can do it and still let you rent there."

    "topic": "Optimal termnumber of months for car finance or lease?",
    "content": "If you have the money to pay cash for the car. Then 0 months will save you the most money. There are of course several caveats. The money for the car has to be in a relatively liquid form. Selling stocks which would trigger taxes may make the pay cash option nonoptimal. Paying cash for the car shouldnt leave you car rich but cash poor. Taking all your savings to pay cash would not be a good idea. Note paying cash doesnt involve taking a wheelbarrow full of bills to the dealer You can use a a check. If cash is not an option then the longest time period balanced by the rates available is best. If the bank says x percent for 1223 months, y percent for 2447 months, Z percent for 48 to... It may be best to take the 47 month loan, because it keeps the middle rate for a long time. You want to lock in the lowest rate you can, for the longest period they allow. The longer period keeps the required minimum monthly payment as low as possible. The lower rate saves you on interest. Remember you generally can pay the loan off sooner by making extra or larger payments. Leasing. Never lease unless you are writing off the monthly lease payment as a business expense. If the choice is monthly lease payments or depreciation for tax purposes the lease can make the most sense. If business taxes arent involved then leasing only means that you have a complex deal where you finance the most expensive part of the ownership period, you have to watch the mileage for several years, and you may have to pay a large amount at the end of the period for damages and excess miles. Plus many times you dont end up with the car at the end of the lease. In the United States one way to get a good deal if you have to get a loan take the rebate from the dealer and the loan from a bankcredit Union. The interest rate at banking institution is a better range of rates and length. Plus you get the dealer cash. Many times the dealer will only give you the 0 interest rate if you pay in 12 months and skip the rebate where the interest paid to the bank will be less than the rebate."

    "topic": "How Does A Special Memorandum Account Work",
    "content": "Here is another explanation of an SMA. SMA refers to the Special Memorandum Account which represents neither equity nor cash but rather a line of credit created when the market value of securities in a Reg. T margin account increase in value. For example, assume the market value of securities purchased at a cost of 10,000 on margin at 50 increase in value to 12,000. This 2,000 increase in market value would create SMA of 1,000, which provides the account holder the ability to either 1 buy additional securities valued at 2,000 assuming a 50 margin rate without depositing up additional funds or 2 withdraw 2,000 in cash, which may be financed by increasing the debit balance if the account holds no cash. It should be noted that while an increase in market value over original cost creates SMA, a subsequent decline in market value has no effect on SMA. SMA will only decline if used to purchase securities or withdraw cash and the only restriction with respect to its use is that the additional purchases or withdrawals do not bring the account below the maintenance margin requirement. SMA will also increase on a dollar for dollar basis in the event of cash deposits or dividends. More details at httpibkb.interactivebrokers.comarticle66"

Bob Senior is a brilliant business man, he starts a company, it is wildly successful, then he dies and Bob Junior inherits the company. If its a privately owned company he may inherit it directly if its a corporation he inherits a controlling interest in the stock. Bob Junior knows nothing about how to run a business. And so he mismanages the company, runs it into the ground, and eventually it goes bankrupt. Stock holders lose their investment, employees lose their jobs, and in general everyone is very unhappy. I suppose it also happens that someone gets rich doing thing A and then decides that hes going to buy a business that does thing B. He has no idea how to run a business doing thing B and he destroys the company.

The \"usual\" ones, metallurgical, electronic, medicine, dental, dont really do the trick. It should be noted that gold performs its inflation hedge function over a long period of time, say 50100 years. Over shorter periods of time, it will spike for other reasons. The latest classic example was in 197980, and the main reason, in my opinion, was the Iranian hostage crisis inflation was secondary. This was a POLITICAL risk situation, but one that was not unwarranted. An attack on 52 U.S. hostages diplomats, no less, was potenially an attack on the U.S. dollar. But gold got so pricey that it lost its \"inflation hedge\" function for some two decades until about 2000. Inflation has not been a notable factor in 2011. But Mideastern political risk has been. Witness Egypt, Libya, and potentially Syria and other countries. Put another way, gold is less of an investment that a \"hedge.\" And not just against inflation."

    "topic": "Confirming that stocks are listed under my name",
    "content": "The answer to your question is \"no\". Unless you specifically ask to receive paper share certificates, then brokers will hold your shares with a custodian company in the brokers own nominee account. If you are able to receive paper certificates, then the registrar of the company whose shares you own will have a record of your name, however this is exceptionally rare these days. Using a stockbroker means that your shares will be held in the brokers nominee account. A nominee company is a custodian charged with the safekeeping of investors securities. It should be a separate entity from the broker itself. In essence, the nominee is the legal owner of the securities, while you retain actual ownership as the beneficiary. Your broker can move and sell the securities on your behalf  and gets to handle all the lovely paperwork  but the assets still belong to you. They cant be claimed by the brokers creditors if things get messy. The main reason for this kind of setup is cost, and this is why brokers are able to offer relatively low dealing costs to their clients. You can, if you wish, ask your broker for an account that deals with paper share certificates. However, few brokers will offer such an account and it will mean that you incur much higher dealing costs and may mean that you cannot sell you shares without first submitting the paper certificates back to your stock broker. Note that the stock exchange plays no role in recording ownership. Nor does your brokers account with the clearing house."

For the general market, e.g. your SP index holdings. You sell to rebalance to your desired asset allocation. As a personal example, at 50, I was full up invested, 95 in stocks. When my wife and I were retired i.e. let go from company, but with no need to go back to work I started shifting to get to a more sane allocation, 8020. The ideal mix may be closer to 6040. Also, there are times the market as a whole is overvalued as measure by PE andor CAPE, made popular by Nobel Prize winning Robert Shiller. During these times, an allocation shift might make sense. For the individual stocks, you had best have a strategy when you buy. Why did you buy XYZ? Because they had promise, decent company with a good outlook for their product? Now that they are up 300, can they keep gaining share or expand their market? Sometimes you can keep raising the bar, and keep a company long term, really long. Other times, the reason you bought no longer applies, they are at or above the valuation you hoped to achieve. Note  I noticed from another question, the OP is in the UK. I answer this my from US centric view, but it should still apply to OP in general. The question was not tagged UK when I replied."

Now that the inheritance looks like it is going to be available soon, she wants to trade back after having enjoyed the use of your fathers money. That might be okay, but simply paying back the original sum with inflation, but without interest, doesnt seem fair to your father. She may not be able to afford to give any more than what she is offering, in which case, she might want to consider offering the original sum now and some portion of her inheritance as interest on that original sum. Im not taking sides in this one. If it were one of my siblings, Id be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt and take a smaller amount back if I felt that the lesson was learned and if I felt that heshe would make wise use of my gift to himher. I have no idea what your fathers current economic situation is, nor am I aware of any other baggage that might influence his feelings about his sister. Its as likely as not that money isnt really what is bothering him, in which case, the amount she repays may have little to do with bridging the divide between them. You might need to ask different questions in the Interpersonal Skills stack if you want to help your father feel better."

    "topic": "Short term parking of a large inheritance?",
    "content": "What are the options available for safe, shortterm parking of funds? Savings accounts are the goto option for safely depositing funds in a way that they remain accessible in the shortterm. There are many options available, and any recommendations on a specific account from a specific institution depend greatly on the current state of banks. As youre in the US, If you choose to save funds in a savings account, its important that you verify that the account or accounts you use are FDIC insured. Also be aware that the insurance limit is 250,000, so for larger volumes of money you may need to either break up your savings into multiple accounts, or consult a Accredited Investment Fiduciary AIF rather than random strangers on the internet. I received an inheritance check... Money is a token we exchange for favors from other people. As their last act, someone decided to give you a portion of their unused favors. You should feel honored that they held you in such esteem. I have no debt at all and aside from a few deferred expenses Youre wise to bring up debt. As a general answer not geared toward your specific circumstances Paying down debt is a good choice, if you have any. Investment accounts have an unknown interest rate, whereas reducing debt is guaranteed to earn you the interest rate that you would have otherwise paid. Creating new debt is a bad choice. Its common for people who receive large windfalls to spend so much that they put themselves in financial trouble. Lottery winners tend to go bankrupt. The best way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it back in your pocket. I am not at all savvy about finances... The vast majority of people are not savvy about finances. Its a good sign that you acknowledge your inability and are willing to defer to others. ...and have had a few bad experiences when trying to hire someone to help me Find an AIF, preferably one from a largish investment firm. You dont want to be their most important client. You just want them to treat you with courtesy and give you simple, and sound investment advice. Dont be afraid to shop around a bit. I am interested in options for safe, short \"parking\" of these funds until I figure out what I want to do. Apart from savings accounts, some money market accounts and mutual funds may be appropriate for parking funds before investing elsewhere. They come with their own tradeoffs and are quite likely higher risk than youre willing to take while youre just deciding what to do with the funds. My personal recommendation for your specific circumstances at this specific time is to put your money in an Aspiration Summit Account purely because it has 1 APY which is the highest interest rate Im currently aware of and is FDIC insured. I am not affiliated with Aspiration. I would then suggest talking to someone at Vanguard or Fidelity about your investment options. Be clear about your expectations and dont be afraid to simply walk away if you dont like the advice you receive. I am not affiliated with Vanguard or Fidelity.  I am not a lawyer, fiduciary, or even a person with a degree in finances. For all you know Im a dog on the internet."

    "topic": "Couch Potato Portfolio for Europeans?",
    "content": "The question is asking for a European equivalent of the socalled \"Couch Potato\" portfolio. \"Couch Potato\" portfolio is defined by the two URLs provided in question as, Criteria for fund composition Fixedincome Regardless of country or supranational market, the fixedincome fund should have holdings throughout the entire length of the yield curve most available maturities, as well as being a mix of government, municipal general obligation, corporate and highyield bonds. Equity The common equity position should be in one equity market index fund. It shouldnt be a DAX30 or CAC40 or DJIA type fund. Instead, you want a combination of growth and value companies. The fund should have as many holdings as possible, while avoiding too much expense due to transaction costs. You can determine how much is too much by comparing candidate funds with those that are only investing in highly liquid, large company stocks. Why it is easier for U.S. and Canadian couch potatoes It will be easier to find two good funds, at lower cost, if one is investing in a country with sizable markets and its own currency. Thats why the Couch Potato strategy lends itself most naturally to the U.S.A, Canada, Japan and probably Australia, Brazil, South Korea and possibly Mexico too. In Europe, preEU, any of Germany, France, Spain, Italy or the Scandinavian countries would probably have worked well. The only concern would be possibly higher equity transactions costs and certainly larger fixedincome buysell spreads, due to smaller and less liquid markets other than Germany. These costs would be experienced by the portfolio manager, and passed on to you, as the investor. For the EU couch potato Remember the criteria, especially part 2, and the intent as described by the Couch Potato name, implying extremely passive investing. You want to choose two funds offered by very stable, reputable fund management companies. You will be rebalancing every six months or a year, only. That is four transactions per year, maximum. You dont need a lot of interaction with anyone, but you DO need to have the means to quickly exit both sides of the trade, should you decide, for any reason, that you need the money or that the strategy isnt right for you. I would not choose an ETF from iShares just because it is easy to do online transactions. For many investors, that is important! Here, you dont need that convenience. Instead, you need stability and an index fund with a good reputation. You should try to choose an EU based fund manager, or one in your home country, as youll be more likely to know who is good and who isnt. Dont use Vanguards FTSE ETF or the equivalent, as there will probably be currency and foreign tax concerns, and possibly forex risk. The couch potato strategy requires an emphasis on low fees with high quality funds and brokers if not buying directly from the fund. As for type of fund, it would be best to choose a fund that is invested in mostly or only EU or EEU European Economic Union stocks, and the same for bonds. That will help minimize your transaction costs and tax liability, while allowing for the sort of broad diversity that helps buy and hold index fund investors."

    "content": "You are really showing some wisdom here, and congratulations on finishing college. Its a lot about likelihoods. If you buy a new car, there is something like a 99.5 chance you will get a car that will not need repairs. If you buy a car for 1200 there is probably a 20 chance that the car will only need minimal repairs. So the answer is there is no real guarantee that spending any amount of money you will end up with a car with no repairs. You also cant assume that with buying a car it will immediately need repairs. Its possible, that you could spend 1200 on a car and it will need an oil change. In three months it might need brakes and in 6 months tires. If that is the case, you could save up the money for repairs. Have you looked for a car? It will take some work, but you might be able to find something in good condition for your budget. If you shop for a loan, go with a good credit union or local bank. Mostly you are looking for a low rate. However, I would advise against it. You worked so hard on getting out of school without debt, why start now? Be weird and buy a car for cash. Heck someone may be able to loan you a car for a short time while you save some money."

Most likely it will not. Make sure that when you go to buy, you have 20 down, AND an emergency fund that will cover you for 3 months of expenses at the new, higher, rate. Hint, thatll probably be in excess of 10k based on a single person with a 1.52k a month mortgage, plus utilities and food. And as a home owner, you will have a lot of things for which that emergency fund will come in handy. Its a matter of when, not if. Consider, 5k for a new roof, 6k for a hvac system, 1.5k for exterior paint, 500 for the plumber, 750 for pest control, 250 to have the tree removed that fell in a storm. 1000 for a new fridge. 500 for a new water heater. 1200 for washer and dryer.

For 14,000 in cash you can probably get a car like a 2013 Ford Fusion that has excellent allwheel drive and winter handling. A new Fusion, loaded, will cost at least 25,000 from a dealer.

    "content": "Typically you diversify a portfolio to reduce risk. The SP 500 is a collection of largecap stocks a diversified portfolio today probably contains a mix of large cap, small cap, bonds, international equity and cash. Right now, if you have a bond component, that part of your portfolio isnt performing as well. The idea of diversification is that you \"smooth out\" the ups and downs of the market and come out ahead in most situations. If you dont have a bond or cash component in your portfolio, you may have picked or had someone pick for you lousy funds. Without more detail, thats about all that can be said. EDIT You provided more detail, so I want to add a little to my answer. Basically, youre in a fund that has high fees 1.58 annually and performance that trails the midcap index. The SP 500 is a largecap index large cap  large company, so a direct comparison is not necessarily meaningful. Since you seem to be new at this, Id recommend starting out with the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund VTSMX or ETF VTI. This is a nice option because it represents the entire stock market and is cheap... its a good way to get started without knowing alot. If your broker charges a transaction fee to purchase Vanguard funds and you dont want to change brokers or pay ETF commissions, look for or ask about transactionfee free \"broad market\" indexes. The expense ratio should be below 0.50 per year and optimally under 0.20.

This includes rent, expenses, emergency fund savings, and the monthly required payment of my auto loan. emphasis added He has 2000 USD left over after monthly expenses which includes rent, food, utilities etc, contribution towards emergency funds, and the required monthly payment on the auto loan. He claims that by applying the 2000 USD per month towards reducing the debt, it would take him 3036 months to be debtfree. But is it not the case that applying the 2000 to the student loan of 18K while continuing to make the auto loan payments will pay the student loan off in less than 10 months? If no payments are made on that 18K student loan, the accrued interest of about 2K in 10 months this is 18.2513.71012 for a total of 20K. In actuality, with the loan being paid down, the interest will be much less. Once the student loan is paid off, the extra 2000 can go towards what is left of the 10K auto loan each month and pay it off in another 4 or 5 months or so. So we are talking of 15 months max instead of 3036 months. Of course, as Carlos Briebiescas points out, the car is more valuable as an asset than can be sold in case of job loss creating a need for cash etc, and so paying it off first might be better, but that is a different calculation."

I can think of all sorts of scenarios that might affect me. Im trying to put my kids through college, so if I lost my job, even if unemployment benefits were adequate to live on, they wouldnt pay for college. I have terrible health insurance so big medical bills could cost me a lot. I have an old car so it could break down any time and need expensive repairs, or even have to be replaced. I might suddenly be charged with a crime that I didnt commit and need a lawyer to defend me. Etc. So in a very real sense, everyones situation is different.

    "content": "A company has 100,000 shares and 100,000 unexercised call options company issued. Share price and strike price both at 1. What country is this related to? I ask because, in the US, most people I know associate a \"call\" option with the instrument that is equivalent to 100 shares. So 100,000 calls would be 10,000,000 shares, which exceeds the number of shares youre saying the company has. I dont know if that means you pulled the numbers out of thin air, or whether it means youre thinking of a different type of option? Perhaps you meant incentive stock options meant to be given to employees? Each one of those is equivalent to a single share. They just arent called \"call options\". In the rest of my answer, Im going to assume you meant stock options. I assume the fact that these options exist will slow any price increases on the underlying shares due to potential dilution? I dont think the company can just create stock options without creating the underlying shares in the first place. Said another way, a more likely scenario is that company creates 200,000 shares and agrees to float 50 of them while reserving the other 50 as the pool for incentive employee stock. They then choose to give the employees options on the stock in the incentive pool, rather than outright grants of the stock, for various reasons. One of which is being nice to the employees in regards to taxes since there is no US tax due at grant time if the strike price is the current price of the underlying stock. An alternative scenario when the company shares are liquidly traded is that the company simply plans to buy back shares from the market in order to give employees their shares when options are exercised. In this case, the company needs the cash on hand, or cash flow to take money from, to buy those shares at current prices. Anyway, in either case, there is no dilution happening WHEN the options get exercised. Any dilution happened before or at the time the options were created. Meaning, the total number of shares in the company was already preset at an earlier time. As a result, the fact that the options exist in themselves will not slow price changes on the stock. However, price changes will be impacted by the total float of shares in the company, or the impact to cash flow if the company has to buy shares to redeem its option commitments. This is almost the same thing youre asking about, but it is technically different as to timing. If this is the case, can this be factored into any option pricing models like blackscholes? Youre including the effect just by considering the total float of shares and net profits from cash flow when doing your modelling."

Obviously, youd still be better off than you are now, since thats still 30 cheaper. But, if youre living essentially paycheck to paycheck, then the extra flexibility of the 400month option can make the difference if something unforeseen happens. 2 How disciplined financially have you proven you can be? The \"Ill make extra payments every month\" sounds real nice, but many people end up not doing it. I should know, Im one of them. Im still paying on my student loans because of it. If you know by having done it before, that you can make that extra 130 go out each and every month and not talk yourself into using it on all sorts of \"more important needs\", then hey, go for it. Financial flexibility is a great thing, and having that monthly nut all your minimum living expenses combined as low as possible contributes greatly to that flexibility. Update Another thing to consider Another thing to consider is what they do with your extra payment. Will they apply it to the principal, or will they treat it as a prepayment? If they apply it to principal, itll be just like if you had that shorter term. Your principal goes down additionally by that extra amount, and the next month, you owe another 400. On the other hand, if they treat it as a prepayment, then that extra 130 will be applied to the next months bill. Principal stays the same, and the next month youll be billed 270. There are two practical differences for you 1 With prepayment, youll pay slightly more interest over that 60 months paying it off. Because its not amortized into the loan, the principal balance doesnt go down faster while the loan exists. And since interest is calculated on the remaining principal balance, end result is more interest than you otherwise would have paid. That sucks, but 2 with the prepayment, consider that at the end of year 2, youd have over 7 months of payments prepaid. So, if some emergency does come up, you dont have to send them any money at all for 7 months. Theres that flexibility again.  Honestly, while this is something you should find out about the loan, its really still a wash. I havent done the math, but with the interest rate, amount of the loan and time frame, I think the extra interest would be pretty minor."

    "content": "You could buy options. I do not know what your time horizon is but it makes all the difference due to theta burn. There are weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and even longer duration options called leaps. You have decided how long of a time frame. You also have to see what the implied volatility is for the underlying because if you think hypothetically that the price of the spy is 100 dollars currently. Today is hypothetically a Thursday and you buy a weekly option expiring on Friday  the next day of strike 100.5 and the call option is priced at .55 cents and you buy it. This means that the underlying has to move .5 dollars in one day to be considered in the money but at time 0, the option should only be worth its intrinsic value which is the underlying, Say the SPY moved 55 cents up from 100 to 100.55, 100.55 minus the strike 100.5  5 cents, so if you payed 55 cents and one day later at expiration its worth 5 cents ,you lost almost 91 of your money, rather with buying and holding you lose a lot less. The leverage is on a 10x scale typically. That is why timing is so important. Anyone can say x stock is going to go up in the future, but if you know when you can make a killing if it is not already priced into the market. Another thing you can do is figure out how much MSFT contributes to the SPX movement in terms of points. What does a 1 move in MSFT doto SPX. If you can calculate that and you think you know where MSFT is going, you can just trade the spy options synthetically as if it were microsoft. You could also buy msft stock on margin as a retail investor, but be careful. Like Rhaskett said, look into an etf that has microsoft. The nasdaq has a nasdaq100 which microsoft is in called the triple Q. The ticker is qqq. PowerShares QQQ, formerly known as \"QQQ\" or the \"NASDAQ 100 Index Tracking Stock\", is an exchangetraded fund based on the Nasdaq100 Index.

    "topic": "How do exchanges match limit orders?",
    "content": "The Limit Order are matched based on amount and time. The orders are listed Highest to Lowest on the Buy Side. The orders are listed Lowest to Highest on the Sell Side. If there are 2 Sell orders for same amount the order which is first in time [fractions of milliseconds] is first. The about is the example as to how the orders would look like on any exchange. Now the highest price the buyer is ready to pay is 20.21 and the lowest price a seller is ready to sell for is 20.25. Hence there is no trade. Now if a new Buy order comes in at 20.25, it matches with the sell and the deal is made. If a new Buy order comes in at 20.30, it still matches at 20.25. Similarly if a Sell order come in at 20.21, it matches and a deal is made. If a Sell order come in at 20.11, it still matches 20.21. Incase of market order, with the above example if there is a Buy order, it would match with the lowest sell order at 20.25, if there is not enough quantity , it would match the remaining quantity to the next highest at 20.31 and continue down. Similarly if there is a Sell market order, the it would match to the maximum a seller is ready to buy, ie 20.21, if there is not sufficient buy quantity at 20.21, it will match with next for 20.19 If say there are new buy order at 20.22 and sell orders at 20.24, these will sit first the the above queue to be matched. In your above example the Lowest Sell order was at 20.10 at time t1 and hence any buy order after time t1 for amount 20.10 or greater would match to this and the price would be 20.10. However if the Buy order was first ie at t1 there was a buy order for 20.21 and then at time later than t1, there is a sell order for say 20.10 [amount less than or equal to 20.21] it would match for 20.21. Essentially the market looks at who was the first to sell at lower price or who was the first to buy at higher price and then decide the trade. Edit [To Clarify xyz] Say if there is an Sell order at 10 Qty 100. There is a buyer who is willing to pay Max 20 and is looking for Qty 500. Your key assumption that the Buyer does not know the current SELL price of 10 is incorrect. Now there are multiple things, the Buyer knows the lowest Sell order is at 10, he can put a matching Buy order at 10 Qty 100, and say 11 Qty 100 etc. This is painful. Second, lets say he puts a Buy order at 10 Qty 100, by the time the order hits the system someone else has put the trade at 10 and his order is fulfilled. So this buyer has to keep looking at booking and keep making adjustments, if its a large order, it would be extremely difficult and frustrating for this Buyer. Hence the logic of giving preference. The later Buy order says ... The Max I can pay is 20, match eveything at the current price and get the required shares."

    "topic": "What is a stock warrant? How do warrants work?",
    "content": "In Australia there are 2 type of warrants I dont know if it is the same in the US, UK and other countries, the first are trading warrants and the second are instalment warrants. The trading warrants are exactly what it says, they are used for trading. They are similar to option and have calls and puts. As Cameron says, they differ from exchange traded options in that they are issued by the financial companies whereas options are generally written by other investors. Instalment warrants on the other hand are usually bought and sold by investors with a longer term view. There are no calls and puts and you can just go long with them. They are also issued by financial companies, and how they work is best explained through an example if I was to buy a stock directly say I would be paying 50 per share, however an instalment warrant in the underlying stock may be offered for 27 per warrant. I could buy the warrant directly from the company when it is issued or on the secondary market just like shares. I would pay the 27 per warrant upfront, and then in 2 years time when the warrant expires I have the choice to purchase the underlying stock for the strike price of say 28, roll over to a new issue of warrants, sell it back on the secondary market, or let it expire, in which case I would receive any intrinsic value left in the warrant. You would have noticed that the warrant purchase price plus the strike price adds up to more than the share price 55 compared to 50. This is the interest component inherent in the warrant which covers the borrowing costs until expiry, when you pay the second portion the strike price and receive the underlying shares. Another difference between Instalment warrants and trading warrants and options is that with instalment warrants you still get the full dividends just like the shares, but at a higher yield than the shares."

    "topic": "Is there any flaw in this investment scheme?",
    "content": "The process of borrowing shares and selling them is called shorting a stock, or \"going short.\" When you use money to buy shares, it is called \"going long.\" In general, your strategy of going long and short in the same stock in the same amounts does not gain you anything. Lets look at your two scenarios to see why. When you start, LOOT is trading at 20 per share. You purchased 100 shares for 2000, and you borrowed and sold 100 shares for 2000. You are both long and short in the stock for 2000. At this point, you have invested 2000, and you got your 2000 back from the short proceeds. You own and owe 100 shares. Under scenario A, the price goes up to 30 per share. Your long shares have gone up in value by 1000. However, you have lost 1000 on your short shares. Your short is called, and you return your 100 shares, and have to pay interest. Under this scenario, after it is all done, you have lost whatever the interest charges are. Under scenario B, the prices goes down to 10 per share. Your long shares have lost 1000 in value. However, your short has gained 1000 in value, because you can buy the 100 shares for only 1000 and return them, and you are left with the 1000 out of the 2000 you got when you first sold the shorted shares. However, because your long shares have lost 1000, you still havent gained anything. Here again, you have lost whatever the interest charges are. As explained in the Traders Exclusive article that RonJohn posted in the comments, there are investors that go long and short on the same stock at the same time. However, this might be done if the investor believes that the stock will go down in a shortterm time frame, but up in the longterm time frame. The investor might buy and hold for the long term, but go short for a brief time while holding the long position. However, that is not what you are suggesting. Your proposal makes no prediction on what the stock might do in different periods of time. You are only attempting to hedge your bets. And it doesnt work. A long position and a short position are opposites to each other, and no matter which way the stock moves, youll lose the same amount with one position that you have gained in the other position. And youll be out the interest charges from the borrowed shares every time. With your comment, you have stated that your scenario is that you believe that the stock will go up long term, but you also believe that the stock is at a shortterm peak and will drop in the near future. This, however, doesnt really change things much. Lets look again at your possible scenarios. You believe that the stock is a longterm buy, but for some reason you are guessing that the stock will drop in the shortterm. Under scenario A, you were incorrect about your shortterm guess. And, although you might have been correct about the longterm prospects, you have missed this gain. You are out the interest charges, and if you still think the stock is headed up over the long term, youll need to buy back in at a higher price. Under scenario B, it turns out that you were correct about the shortterm drop. You pocket some cash, but there is no guarantee that the stock will rise anytime soon. Your investment has lost value, and the gain that you made with your short is still tied up in stocks that are currently down. Your strategy does prevent the possibility of the unlimited loss inherent in the short. However, it also prevents the possibility of the unlimited gain inherent in the long position. And this is a shame, since you fundamentally believe that the stock is undervalued and is headed up. You are sabotaging your longterm gains for a chance at a small shortterm gain."

    "content": "Like in the US, more flexibility is extended to hidden orders. Australia has taken an aggressive approach to hidden orders in the direction of lower ticks. Aussies have a rich financial that evolved differently than the Dutch custom more familiarly known in the UK and US. They, like Chicago evolved out of commodities trade rather than trade. When commodities are worth nearly nothing per unit, larger precision comes naturally. For the Dutch, it was the opposite. A single ship would trade in 164 share or for the largest vessels, 1128 share. Here, theres no point to high precision. New York, founded by the Dutch specialized in logistics just the same. To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, so both Chicago, Australia, and other financial systems built by commodities rather than trade have extended the higher precision logic to everything else, and pricing is fantastic. It should not be a surprise why Australia has taken a lead in pushing infinite precision."

    "topic": "Do I pay a zero  loan before another to clear both loans faster?",
    "content": "This is more of an interesting question then it looks on first sight. In the USA there are some tax reliefs for mortgage payments, which we dont have in the UK unless you are renting out the property with the mortgage. So firstly work out the interest rate on each loan taking into account any tax reliefs, etc. Then you need to consider the charges for paying off a loan, for example often there is a charge if you pay off a mortgage. These days in the UK, most mortgagees allow you to pay off at least 10 a year without hitting such a charge  but check your mortgage offer document. How interest is calculated when you make an early payment may be different between your loans  so check. Then you need to consider what will happen if you need another loan. Some mortgages allow you to take back any overpayments, most dont. Remortgaging to increase the size of your mortgage often has high charges. Then there is the effect on your credit rating paying more of a loan each month then you need to, often improves your credit rating. You also need to consider how interest rates may change, for example if you mortgage is a fixed rate but your car loan is not and you expect interest rates to rise, do the calculations based on what you expect interest rates to be over the length of the loans. However, normally it is best to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first. Reasons for penalties for paying of some loans in the UK. In the UK some short term loans normally under 3 years add on all the interest at the start of the loan, so you dont save any interest if you pay of the loan quicker. This is due to the banks having to cover their admin costs, and there being no admin charge to take out the loan. Fixed rate loansmortgagees have penalties for overpayment, as otherwise when interest rates go down, people will change to other lenders, so making it a one way bet that the banks will always loose. I believe in the USA, the central bank will under right such loans, so the banks dont take the risk."

    "content": "While its not true that you have to use leverage to participate in Forex, the alternative makes it impractical for most people to be able to do so. You need to be able to put a lot of money into it in order to not trade on leverage. The fact is, most accounts for \"normal\" people require leverage because the size of the typical contract is more than the average person can afford to risk or usually more than the average person has. Leverage, however, in the Forex market is not like Leverage in the stock or commodities market well, theyre the same thing in theory, but they are executed differently. In Forex, the broker is the one lending you the money in nearly all cases, and they will cash out your position when your account balance is exhausted. Thus, there is no risk for them barring fraud or other illegal issues. Technically, I dont believe they guarantee that you will not accrue a debt, but Ive never heard of anyone having their position cashed out and then owed more money. Theyve very good about making sure you can only spend money youve deposited. To put this another way, if you have 1,000 in your account and you are leveraged to 100,000. Once your trade drops to 1000 in losses your position is automatically cashed out. There is no risk to the broker, and no risk to you other than your 1000... So trading without leverage has little value, while traiding with leverage has lots of potential gain and no downsides other than a faster rate of loss, but if youre worried about that, just trade smaller lots."

You could do the two separate loans up front to buy the land and finance the construction, then at the end roll both into a conventional mortgage to close out the land and construction loans. This option will only work if you do all three through the same lender. Trying to engage various lenders will require a whole new refinance process, which I very much doubt you would want to go through. These are sometimes called combo loans, since they aggregate several different loan products in one \"transaction.\" Not a lot of places do land loans, so I would suggest first find a lender that will give you a land loan and set an appoint with a loan representative.

If you have 10,000 to invest and invest it in 20 securities, then a 20 drop in one security would only cause you to lose 1 of your initial investment. So far this is looking better from a diversification point of view. But then the issue of fees comes in. If you paid 10 per trade to buy those 20 securities you already spent 2 of your initial investment in fees! Not to mention you will pay at least another 200 to get out of all those positions.

On the other hand, they may see your contingency as low risk as the market is so hot. This is why you probably need a really good agent. They can frame the contingency in a very positive light."

He is going to return my amount after 34 Months From the description it looks like you would like to loan to your brother on repatriation basis. Yes this is allowed. See the RBI Guide here and here for more details. There are some conditions iv Scheme for raising loans from NRIs on repatriation basis Borrowings not exceeding US 2,50,000 or its equivalent in foreign exchange by an individual resident in India from his close relatives resident outside India, subject to the conditions that  a the loan is free of interest b the minimum maturity period of the loan is seven years c The amount of loan is received by inward remittance in free foreign exchange through normal banking channels or by debit to the NREFCNR account of the nonresident lender d The loan is utilised for the borrowers personal purposes or for carrying on his normal business activity but not for carrying on agriculturalplantation activities, purchase of immovable property or sharesdebenturesbonds issued by companies in India or for relending. Although it is mentioned as Seven years, this is revised to one year. Since he cannot deposit into my NRE account I guess he has to deposit it into my NRO account. A repatriateable loan as above can be deposited into NRE Account. Is there any illegality here doing such transaction? No. Please ensure proper paper work to show this as loan and document the money trail. Also once I get my money in NRO account do I need to pay taxes in India on the money he deposited? This question does not arise."

    "topic": "Advantages of paying more of your mortgage while you know you wont continue to live there your whole life",
    "content": "I will add one thought on to this thread. This is a financial concept called \"Net Present Value\". In plain English, it means \"Whats the best use for your money right now?\" So, lets say you have an extra 300month which is not being spent on living expenses. If you leave that money under your pillow or spend it on beer or fancy electronics! instead of paying off your startersloan early, that is costing you 3000.0412 per month, every month. So 1month, or 12year. This is cumulative for the life of your loan. So not paying 300 this month will ultimately cost you 120 assuming you keep the loan open for 10 years. If youre saying \"pay my debts or spend the money on a snappy smartphone?\" the answer is that you should pay your debts. Now, heres the important part. Lets suppose you have a better use for the money than beer or electronics. Lets suppose you have a mutual fund which will reliably provide you with a return of 10 a year. If you put that 300month into a highyield fund, and if the returns are consistent, you are STILL paying that 12year because you invested elsewhere and didnt pay your debts, but you are realizing profits of 3000.1122.5month on the invested money. 2.511.5month, which is a net gain. So, in some cases, paying off your debt may not be the best use of your money. There are a number of other questions involved which are related to your exposure to capital gains taxes, incentives or disincentives for holding debt, c. c. These are generally country specific. A poster above who seems to be familiar with Netherlands law did a good explanation of some of those incentives. Im in the US, and our incentive and disincentive system is different. TLDR It depends."

Just assume that it comes off the top and doesnt add at all to your deductions. Then for April, do the same by June 15. Just like your W2 is used to estimate how much your employer should withhold, the 1040ES is designed to estimate how much extra you need to pay to the IRS to avoid penalties.

You can also get essentially the same index funds by directly purchasing them from the mutual fund company. To buy an ETF you need a brokerage account and have to pay a transaction fee. Buying only 1000 at a time the broker transaction fee will eat too much of your money. You want to keep such fees way down below 0.1. Pay attention to transaction fees and fund expense ratios. Or buy an equivalent index fund directly from the mutual fund company. This generally costs nothing in transaction fees if you have at least the minimum account value built up. If you buy every month or two you are dollar cost averaging, no matter what kind of account you are using. Keep doing that, even if the market values are going down. Especially if the market values are going down! If you can keep doing this then forget about certificates of deposit. At current rates you cannot build wealth with CDs."

    "topic": "Should I continue to invest in an SP 500 index fund?",
    "content": "I would be very cautious about investing any more funds into the SP500 at this stage. You are quite correct in your observation with the charts regarding the 2001 and 2008 crashes, and below is the chart of the SP500 over the last 20 years with some indicators on it. The green line on the price chart is the 100 week Moving Average MA and the pink line below the price chart is the Moving Average of the Rate of Change ROC Indicator. In general the market is moving up if price is above the 100 week MA and the ROC is above 0, and viseversa the market is moving down if price is below the 100 week MA and the ROK is below 0. Both times in 2001 and in 2008 when prices broke below the 100 week MA and then the ROC crossed below the zero line, well we all know what happened next. In 2001 prices kept falling and the ROC didnt cross back above zero for about 2.5 years, in 2008 much the same happened and the ROC didnt cross back above zero for over 20 months. Now as we are reaching the end of 2015 prices have once again broken below the 100 week MA and the ROC is just above the zero line quickly heading down towards it. If you have a 5 to 8 year time frame, and prices do continue to fall much further after the ROC crosses below the zero line, your current funds and any new funds you invest in this ETF will potentially see heavy losses for the next one to two years and then take another year to two years or more to recover to current levels. This means that your funds will potentially have no gains at all in 5 or 6 years time. A better option is to get out of the market once the ROC crosses below zero and then look to get back in once the recovery has started, when the ROC crosses back above the Zero line. You might be out of the market for a year or two, but once you get back in you can expect robust gains over the next 3 to 5 years. If you do get out and things reverse quite quickly you can easily just get back in. In mid2010 and mid2011 the price broke below the 100 week MA but the ROC remained above Zero and prices continued moving up after short corrections. In mid2012 the ROC got very close to the Zero line but did not cross below it, and again prices continued to go up after a small correction. You should plan for the worst and be ready if it occurs. If you dont plan youre just hoping and hoping is what will keep you awake at night whist things are going against you."

So, if your earmarked money is coming from savings only, then you would not be eligible to contribute. As far as whether you can designate student loans for the educational expenses and then used earned income for an IRA I would imagine that is fine.

    "content": "Sales tax and luxury tax is what you will have to pay tax wise, and they are nonrefundable in most cases but the rules vary area to area. This really tripped up some friends of mine I had come from England. The rules are complicated and regional. Sales tax is anywhere from 0 to 10.25 and are not usually applied to raw foods. Luxury taxes are usually state level and only apply to things most people consider a large purchase. Jewelry, cars, houses, etc. Not things your likely to buy. Small, \"normal\" jewelry usually doesnt count. Diamond covered flavaflav clock ... probably has a luxury tax. For sales tax, it can change a lot. Dont be afraid to ask. People ask all the time. Its normal. I personally add 10 to what I buy. Sales tax in my city is 7, county is 6.5, state is 6. So you can get different rates depending on what side of the street you shop on some times. Under normal circumstances you do not get a refund on these taxes. Some states do give refunds. Usually however the trouble of getting that refund isnt worth it unless making a large purchase. You are not exempt from paying sales tax. Depending on where you go you may get asked. Business are exempt if they are purchasing things to resell. Only the end customer pays sales tax. Depending on where you go, online purchases may not be subject to sales tax. Though they might. That, again, depends on city, county, and state laws. Normally, you will have to pay sales tax at the register. It will be calculated into your total, and show as a line item on your receipt. http3.bp.blogspot.comyAvAm2BQ3xsTudYlfLDzIAAAAAAAAAGsgYG8wJeaohws1600great2Boutdoors2Breceipt2BQR2Bbefore2Band2Bafter.jpg Also some products have other nonrefundable taxes.

In your case, the broker has chosen to call these a wash despite even having different underlying indices. Talking to the broker is the first step as they will report it to the IRS.

    "topic": "As a young adult, what can I be doing with my excess income?",
    "content": "You apparently assume that pouring money into a landlords pocket is a bad thing. Not necessarily. Whether it makes sense to purchase your own home or to live in a rental property varies based on the market prices and rents of properties. In the long term, real estate prices closely follow inflation. However, in some areas it may be possible that real estate prices have increased by more than inflation in the past, say, 10 years. This may mean that some stupid people assume that real estate prices continue to appreciate at this rate in the future. The price of real estates when compared to rents may become unrealistically high so that the rental yield becomes low, and the only reasonable way of obtaining money from real estate investments is price appreciation continuing. No, it will not continue forever. Furthermore, an individual real estate is a very poorly diversified investment. And a very risky investment, too a mold problem can destroy the entire value of your investment, if you invest in only one property. Real estates are commonly said to be less risky than stocks, but this applies only to large real estate portfolios when compared with large stock portfolios. It is easier to build a large stock portfolio with a small amount of money to invest when compared to building a large real estate portfolio. Thus, I would consider this how much return are you going to get by not needing to pay rent, but needing to pay some minor maintenance costs when purchasing your own home? How much does the home cost? What is the annual return on the investment? Is it larger than smaller when compared to investing the same amount of money in the stock market? As I said, an individual house is a more risky investment than a welldiversified stock portfolio. Thus, if a welldiversified stock portfolio yields 8 annually, I would demand 10 return from an individual house before considering to move my money from stocks to a house."

    "topic": "I cant understand candlestick shadows",
    "content": "Each candlestick in a candlestick chart represents the open, close, high and low for a period of time. If you are looking at a daily chart it represents the open price, close price, high price and low price for that day. If you are looking at an hourly chart, then a single candlestick represents the open, close, high and low prices for an hour. If looking at a weekly chart, then a single candlestick will represent the opening price on Monday morning, the closing price on Friday afternoon, and the highest and lowest price for that week. The diagram below represents the two main types of candle sticks. When the price closes higher than they open for the period of the candlestick it is called a bullish candle and the main body is usually represented in green. When the price closes lower than they open for the period of the candlestick it is called a bearish candle and the main body is usually represented in red. In a bullish candle with a large real body and small shadows or wicks, where prices open near the low of the period and close near the top of the period, it represents a very bullish period especially if volume is high. An example of this situation could be when good news is released to the market and most market participants want to buy the shares driving prices higher during the period. An example of a bullish candle with a small real body and a large upper shadow or wick could be when market participants start buying early during the period, then some negative news comes out or prices reach a major resistance level, then prices drop from their highs but still close higher than the open. The large upper shadow represents some indecision in prices moving higher. In a bearish candle with a large real body and small shadows or wicks, where prices open near the high of the period and close near the low of the period, it represents a very bearish period especially if volume is high. An example of this situation could be when bad news is released to the market and most market participants want to sell the shares driving prices lower during the period. An example of a bearish candle with a small real body and a large lower shadow or wick could be when market participants start selling early during the period, then some positive news comes out or prices reach a major support level, then prices move up from their lows but still close lower than the open. The large lower shadow represents some indecision in prices moving lower. These are just some examples of what can be derived from looking at candlestick charts. There are plenty more and too much to include in this answer. Another type of candle is the Doji, represented in the diagram below. The Doji Candle represents indecision in the market. Prices open then move up to the high of the period then start falling past the open before reversing again and closing either at the open or very close to the open. The market participants cant decide whether the price should move up or down, so prices end up closing very close to where they opened. A doji Candle close to a market high or low could represent a turning point in the short term trend and could mean that over the next period or two prices could reverse and go in the opposite direction. There are many more definitions for candlestick charts, and I would recommend an introductory book on candlestick charting, like one from the \"Dummies\" series. The main things to keep in mind as a beginner it that a strong bullish candle with small shadows and large real body could represent further price movement upwards, a strong bearish candle with small shadows and large real body could represent further movement downwards, and any candle with large shadows could represent indecision and a reversal from the direction of the large shadow."

    "topic": "Opening a Roth IRA account, what is the fee structure for Vanguard, Scottrade and TIAACREF",
    "content": "This answer is somewhat incomplete as I dont have definitive conclusions about some parts of your question. Your question includes some very specific subquestions that may best be answered by contacting the investment companies youre considering. I dont see any explicit statement of fees for TIAACREF either. I suggest you contact them and ask. There is mention on the site of notransactionfee funds NTF, but I wasnt able to find a list of such funds. Again, you might have to ask. Vanguard also offers some nonVanguard funds without transaction fees. If you go the Vanguard page on other mutual funds you can use the dropdown on the right to select other fund companies. Those with \"NTF\" by the name have no transaction fees. Scottrade also offers NTF funds. You can use their screener and select \"no load\" and \"no transaction fee\" as some of your filters. You are correct that you want to choose an option that will offer a good lineup of funds that you can buy without transaction fees. However, as the links above show, Vanguard and TIAACREF are not the only such options. My impression is that almost any firm that has their own funds will sell them or at least some of them to you without a transaction fee. Also, as shown above, many places will sell you other companies funds for free too. You have plenty of options as far as free trades, so it really depends on what funds you like. If you google for IRA providers you will find more than you can shake a stick at. If youre interested in lowcost index funds, Vanguard is pretty clearly the leader in that area as their entire business is built around that concept. TIAACREF is another option, as is Fideltiy which you didnt mention, and innumerable others. Realistically, though, you probably dont need a gigantic lineup of funds. If youre juggling money between more than a handful of funds, your investment scheme is probably needlessly complex. The standard advice is to decide on a broad allocation of money into different asset classes e.g., US stocks, US bonds, international stocks, international bonds, find a place that offers funds in those areas with low fees and forget about all the other funds."

    "content": "Upstream is into businesses that supply the original business downstream is into businesses that make use of the original product. So in that description, what they are saying is that the original business received products from plantations and sent products to manufacturing. This is also called vertical integration. Meaning that they are diversifying along their supply chain so that they control more of it. This is in contrast with horizontal integration, where they move into new products that either compete with the existing products or which are entirely separate. In general, the upside of vertical integration is that a company is less reliant on suppliers and intermediate consumers and has more control over its supply chain. The downside is that they have less opportunity to partner with other companies in the same supply chain, as they compete with them. Some companies are better at managing to do both. For example, Amazon.com has integrated fulfillment and sales. But partners can still do their own fulfillment andor sales, choosing how much to send out to Amazon. If you are investing in individual stocks, integrated companies can be problematic in that they cut across diversification areas. So they can be harder to balance with other stocks. You can either buy plantations, transport, and manufacturing together or not buy at all. If your investment strategy says to increase plantations and reduce manufacturing, this can be difficult to implement with an integrated company. Of course, everyone else has the same problem, which can lead to integrated companies being undervalued. So they may be an opportunity as a value stock."

You must add these amounts to the basis of your property. You can, however, deduct assessments or taxes for local benefits if they are for maintenance, repair, or interest charges related to those benefits. An example is a charge to repair an existing sidewalk and any interest included in that charge. If only a part of the assessment is for maintenance, repair, or interest charges, you must be able to show the amount of that part to claim the deduction. If you cannot show what part of the assessment is for maintenance, repair, or interest charges, you cannot deduct any of it. An assessment for a local benefit may be listed as an item in your real estate tax bill. If so, use the rules in this section to find how much of it, if any, you can deduct. I have never seen a tax bill that said this amount is for new streets, and the rest i for things the IRS says you can deduct. The issue is that if the Center City tax bill is a separate line or a separate bill then does it count. I would go back to the first line of the quote from Pub 530 You cannot deduct amounts you pay for local benefits that tend to increase the value of your property. Then I would look at the quote from the CCD web site The Center City District CCD is a business improvement district. Our mission is to keep Philadelphias downtown, called Center City, clean, safe, beautiful and fun. We provide security, cleaning and promotional services that supplement, but do not replace, basic services provided by the City of Philadelphia and the fundamental responsibilities of property owners. CCD also makes physical improvements to the downtown, installing and maintaining lighting,  signs, banners, trees and landscape elements. and later on the same page CCD directly bills and collects mandatory payments from properties in the district. CCD also receives voluntary contributions from the owners of taxexempt properties that benefit from our services. The issues is that it is a business improvement district BID, and you arent a business I did find this document from the city of Philadelphia explain how to establish a BID If the nature of the BID is such that organizers wish to include residential properties within the district and make these properties subject to the assessment, it may make sense to assess these properties at a lower level than a commercial property, both because BID services and benefits are businessfocused, and because owneroccupants often cannot treat NID assessments as taxdeductible business expenses, like commercial owners do. Care must be taken to ensure that the difference in commercial and residential assessment rates is equitable, and complies with the requirements of the CEIA. from the same document Funds for BID programs and services are generated from a special assessment paid by the benefited property owners directly to the organization that manages the BIDs activities. Note many leases have a clause that allows property owners to pass the BID assessment on to their tenants. Because they are authorized by the City of Philadelphia, the assessment levied by the BID becomes a legal obligation of the property owner and failure to pay can result in the filing of a lien. I have seen discussion that some BIDS can accept tax deductible donations. This means if a person itemizes they can deduct the donation. I would then feel comfortable deducting the tax because If you cant deduct it that would mean the only people who cant deduct it are home owners. So deduct it. keep in mind I am not a tax professional"

    "content": "There is certainly an obligation in some cases of a company to distribute profit, either as dividend or a stock buy back. Activist investors frequently push for one or the other when a company is doing well  sometimes to the detriment of future growth, in some eyes  and can even file shareholder lawsuits saying the company is not doing its duty to its shareholders by simply holding onto cash. Apple famously held out from doing either for years under Steve Jobs, and only in the last few years started doing both  a large dividend and a share buyback which increases the value of remaining shares as EPS then goes up with fewer shares out there. Carl Icahn for example is one of those investors in Apples case [and in many cases!] who put significant pressure, particularly when they were sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars. Ultimately, a forprofit corporations board is tasked with maximizing its shareholders wealth as such, it can buy back shares, pay dividends, sell the company, liquidate the company, or expand the company, at its discretion, so long as it can justify to its shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize the value of their holdings. Companies in their growth phase often dont return any money and simply reinvest  but the longterm hope is to either return money in the form of dividends on profits, or the sale of the company."

    "topic": "Why is the price of my investment only updated once per day?",
    "content": "I strongly suggest you go to www.investor.gov as it has excellent information regarding these types of questions. A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds, and shortterm debt. The combined holdings of the mutual fund are known as its portfolio. Investors buy shares in mutual funds. Each share represents an investors part ownership in the fund and the income it generates. When you buy shares of a mutual fund youre buying it at NAV, or net asset value. The NAV is the value of the funds assets minus its liabilities. SEC rules require funds to calculate the NAV at least once daily. Different funds may own thousands of different stocks. In order to calculate the NAV, the fund company must value every security it owns. Since each securitys valuation is changing throughout the day its difficult to determine the valuation of the mutual fund except for when the market is closed. Once the market has closed 4pm eastern and securities are no longer trading, the company must get accurate valuations for every security and perform the valuation calculations and distribute the results to the pricing vendors. This has to be done by 6pm eastern. This is a difficult and, more importantly, a time consuming process to get it done right once per day. Having worked for several fund companies I can tell you there are many days where companies are getting this done at the very last minute. When you place a buy or sell order for a mutual fund it doesnt matter what time you placed it as long as you entered it before 4pm ET. Cutoff times may be earlier depending on who youre placing the order with. If companies had to price their funds more frequently, they would undoubtedly raise their fees."

In short, in a rate rising environment its not like rates can go much lower in the foreseeable future, these bond prices will drop in general in addition to any company specific events occurred to these names, so be prepared for some paper losses. Just because a bond is rated highly by credit agencies like SP or Moodys does not automatically mean their prices do not fluctuate. Yes, there is always a demand for highly rated bonds from pension funds, mutual funds, etc. because of their investment mandates. But I would suggest looking beyond credit ratings and yield, and look further into whether these bonds are securedunsecured and if secured, by what. Keep in mind in recent financial crisis, prices of those CDOsCLOs ended up plunging even though they were given AAA ratings by rating agencies because some were backed by housing properties that were overvalued and loans made to borrowers having difficulties to make repayments. Hence, these type of \"bonds\" have greater default risks and traded at huge discounts. Most of them are also callable, so you may not enjoy the seemingly high yield till their maturity date. Like others mentioned, buying bonds outright is usually a big ticket item. I would also suggest reviewing your cash liquidity and opportunity cost as oppose to investing in other asset classes and instruments."

Consumers purchasing certain goods during the tax holiday do not have to pay sales tax like they normally would. Effectively the price is slightly lower during those days with the purpose of giving people an extra reason to shop at that time. During the tax holiday the stores make the exact same profit that they normally do, but they may experience a bump in sales simply because more people will shop during that time. Income tax for both consumers and the businesses is not affected by this. Although New York state was the first state to implement a tax holiday 20 years ago, they no longer have one today, though they do have certain goods which have a lower tax rate year round."

As in Partnerships members can have a different percentage ownership to the share of profits. The LLC reports the share of the profits of the members. Then the members pay the tax as an individual. The profit of the LLC is deemed to have been transferred to the members regardless of any funds transferred. This is often the case as the LLC may need to retain the profits for use in the business. Late paying customers may mean there is less cash in the LLC than is available to distribute. The first answer is wrong, only a C corporation files a tax return. All other corporate structures are passthrough entities. The C corporation pays corporation tax and is not required to pass any funds to the shareholders. If the C corporation passes funds to the shareholders this is a dividend, and taxable to the shareholder, hence double taxation."

    "content": "I dont understand the logic in the other answer, and I think it doesnt make sense, so here is my take You pay taxes on income, not on sales price. So if you put X  of your own money in the account and it becomes X  Y  in the future, at the moment of liquidation, you will own taxes on the Y . Never on the X , as it was your own already taxed money to begin with. The difference between longterm and shortterm gains just influences the tax rate on Y. If you donate the gain alone the Y  to charity, you can deduct Y from your tax base. So adding Y to your tax base and then deducting Y again obviously leaves your tax base at the old value, so you pay no extra taxes. Which seems logical, as you didnt make any money in the process. Aside from extreme cases where the deductible gain is too large a percentage from your income or negative, I dont see why this would ever be different. So you can take your original 100  back out and donate all gains, and be fine. Note that potential losses are seen different, as the IRA regulations are not symmetric."

If you buy it for more or less than that 1000, say 900, theres some math not for me, I use a finance calculator to tell you your return taking the growth to maturity into account, i.e. the extra 100 you get when you get the full 1000 back. Obviously, for bonds, you care about whether the comp[any or municipality will pay you back at all, and then you care about how much youll make when then do. In that order. For stocks, the picture is abit different as some companies give no dividend but reinvest all profits, think Berkshire Hathaway. On the other hand, many people believe that the dividend is important, and choose to buy stocks that start with a nice yield, a 30 stock with a 1yr dividend is 3.3 yield. Sounds like not much, but over time you expect the company to grow, increase in value and increase its dividend. 10 years hence you may have a 40 stock and the dividend has risen to 1.33. Now its 4.4 of the original investment, and you sit on that gain as well."

To find out the differences between them you can refer to the following link describing The difference between a share trader and a shareholder.

Losses incurred in the business of share trading are treated the same as any other losses from business. If your activities change from investor to trader, your investment changes from a CGT capital gains tax asset to trading stock. This can trigger CGT event for any investments you currently hold as they change from CGT assets to trading stock. Once you have changed over to a trader you will not be entitled to the 50 CGT discount for stocks held over 12 months.

Both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we both dont want to take money from each other. In marriage, there is no more financial independence. Do not think in those terms. Life can throw so many curve balls that you will regret it. Imagine sitting down with your new bride and running through the math. She is to contribute X to the family each month and you are to contribute Y. Then next thing you know, 6 months later, she has cancer and has to undergo expensive and debilitating treatment. There is no way she can contribute her X anymore. You tell her that is okay and that you understand, but the pressure weighs down on her every day because she feels like she is not meeting your expectations. Or alternatively, everything goes great with your X, Y plan. A few years down the road your wife is pregnant, so you revisit the plan, readjust, etc. Everything seems great. When your child is born, however, the baby has a severe physical or mental handicap. You and your wife decide that she will quit her job to raise your beautiful child. But, the whole time, in the back of her mind she cant get out of her head that she is no longer financially independent and not living up to your expectations. These stresses are not what you want in your marriage. Here is what we do in my family. Hopefully, some of this will be helpful to you. Every year my wife and I sit down and determine what our financial goals are for the year. How much do we want to be putting in retirement? How much do we want to give to charity? Do we want to take any family vacations? We set goals together on what we want to achieve with our money. There is no my money or her money, just ours. Doesnt matter where it comes from. At the beginning of every month, we create a budget in a spreadsheet. It has categories like food, mortgage or rent, transportation, clothing, utilities and we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those. It also has categories for entertainment, retirement, charity, cell phones, internet, and so on. Again, we put down how much we expect to spend on each of those. In the spreadsheet, we also track how much income we expect that month and our totals income minus expenses. If that value is positive, we determine what to do with the remainder. Maybe we save some for a rainy day or for car repairs. Maybe we treat ourselves to an extra fancy dinner. The point is, every dollar should be accounted for. If she wants to go to dinner with some friends, we put that in the budget. If I want a new video game, we put that in the budget. Once a week, we take all our receipts and tally up where we spent our money. We then see how we are doing on our budget. Maybe we were a little high in one category and lower than expected in another. We adjust. We are flexible. But, we go over our finances often to make sure we are achieving our goals. Some specific goals Id recommend that the two of you consider in your first such yearly meeting You get out of life what you put into it, and you will get out of your finances what the two of you put into them. By being on the same page, your marriage will be much happier. Moneyfinances are one of the top causes of divorce. If you two are working together on this, you are much more likely to succeed."

I have found it very helpful to read books on the issue, one I just finished was \"The Bogleheads Guide to Investing\" which speaks mostly on mutual and index funds.

Research has shown that people cannot predict the stock market, which is why many people suggest index based funds. An index fund generally tracks a group of companies. Example an index fund of the SP 500 will try to mimic the returns that the SP 500 has. Overall, managed funds are more expensive than index funds because the fund manager must be paid to manage it.

It could be the inclusion of floor plans that are carefully designed to add square footage at minimum cost and thus reduce the average cost per square foot without actually being cheaper otherwise, less insulation, thinner walls, cheap piping, minimized wiring, or they are just efficient and competitive. As you pointed out they dont have gas, so thats certainly one way you know they cut costs  no gas lines to install! As the article from NAHB Cost of Constructing A Home points out, though, what this figure includes can vary. Does it include the finished lot? If so then a smaller lot would mean lower square footage building price  because the land is smaller and cheaper, not the house! Is any kind of financing quoted in the price? Compare also changeplan costs, any penalties for delays in construction, grade of materials, floor plans, customization costs, fees or premiums to pick colorsfloorscounterscabinetsfixtures, and so on. What about central cooling and heating  are they quoting an electric furnace? How does electrical heating in your area compare to the cost of gas heat? relative pricing of electric and gas vary widely by region and climate In short often square footage price isnt the whole story of what it would cost to construct a home. Ensure you are comparing everything thats important to you and you are getting a full quote, not comparing small isolate salespitch figures with no clear details. If it turns out the price is 25 lower than other builders in your area and they give you what you are wanting, and you have the good sense to have a qualified home inspector andor structural engineer inspect the home thoroughly before you take possession, then you might just have found a good builder! Id encourage you to personally visit some of their past construction work, such as houses they build 210 years ago and ensure they are in the sort of condition youd expect."

    "topic": "Why does the calculation for percentage profit vary based on whether a position is short vs. long?",
    "content": "The problem with rate of return calculation on short positions is, that the commonly used approach assumes an initial investment creating a cash outflow. If we want to apply this approach to short selling, we should look at the trade from another perspective. We buy money and pay for this money with stock. Our investment to buy 50 in your example is 1 share. When closing the short position, we effectively sell back our money 50 and receive 2 shares. Our profit on this position is obviously 1 share. Setting this in relation to our investment of 1 share yields a performance of 100 in reality, we do not sell back the entire cash but only the amount needed to get back our investment of 1 share. This is actually comparable to a purchase of stock which we only partially close to get back our invested cash amount and keep the remaining shares as our profit"

    "topic": "Does the IRS give some help or leniency to firsttime taxpayers?",
    "content": "No, there is no special leniency given to first time tax payers. In general, this shouldnt be an issue. The IRS collects your taxes out of every one of your paychecks throughout the entire year in what is called a Withholding Tax. The amount that the IRS withholds is calculated on your W4 Form that you file with your employer whenever you take a new job. The form helps you calculate the right number of allowances to claim usually this is the number of personal exemptions, but depending upon if you work a second job, are married and your spouse works, or if you itemize, the number of allowances can be increased. WITHHOLDING TAX Withholding tax also known as payroll withholding is essentially income tax that is withheld from your wages and sent directly to the IRS by your employer. In other words, its like a credit against the income taxes that you must pay for the year. By subtracting this money from each paycheck that you receive, the IRS is basically withholding your anticipated tax payment as you earn it. In general, most people overestimate their tax liability. This is bad for them, because they have essentially given the IRS an interest free loan and werent able to use the money to earn interest themselves. I havent heard of any program targeted at first time tax payers to tell them to file a return, but considering that most tax payers overpay they should or they are giving the government a free grant."

    "topic": "How much is inflation?",
    "content": "Nobel laureate economist, Paul Krugman, wrote a piece many moons ago about economic expansion and money supply. As an illustration of how money supply affects the economy, he used the example of a babysitting coop. While simplistic, it provides an easy to grasp notion of how printing money and restricting it e.g. by pegging the currency to gold reserves can affect the economy. Here is an excerpt from his webpage  httpweb.mit.edukrugmanwwwhowfast.html  \"With the decline of the traditional extended family, in which relatives were available to take care of children at need, many parents in the United States have sought alternative arrangements. A popular scheme is the babysitting coop, in which a group of parents agree to help each other out on a reciprocal basis, with each parent serving both as babysitter and babysittee. Any such coop requires rules that ensure that all members do their fair share. One natural answer, at least to people accustomed to a market economy, is to use some kind of token or marker system parents \"earn\" tokens by babysitting, then in turn hand over these tokens when their own children are minded by others. For example, a recently formed coop in Western Massachusetts uses Popsicle sticks, each representing one hour of babysitting. When a new parent enters the coop, he or she receives an initial allocation of ten sticks. This system is selfregulating, in the sense that it automatically ensures that over any length of time a parent will put in more or less the same amount of time that he or she receives. It turns out, however, that establishing such a token system is not enough to make a coop work properly. It is also necessary to get the number of tokens per member more or less right. To see why, suppose that there were very few tokens in circulation. Parents will want on average to hold some reserve of tokens  enough to deal with the possibility that they may want to go out a few times before they have a chance to babysit themselves and earn more tokens. Any individual parent can, of course, try to accumulate more tokens by babysitting more and going out less. But what happens if almost everyone is trying to accumulate tokens  as they will be if there are very few in circulation? One parents decision to go out is anothers opportunity to babysit. So if everyone in the coop is trying to add to his or her reserve of tokens, there will be very few opportunities to babysit. This in turn will make people even more reluctant to go out, and use up their precious token reserves and the level of activity in the coop may decline to a disappointingly low level. The solution to this problem is, of course, simply to issue more Popsicle sticks. But not too many  because an excess of popsicle sticks can pose an equally severe problem. Suppose that almost everyone in the coop has more sticks than they need then they will be eager to go out, but reluctant to babysit. It will therefore become hard to find babysitters  and since opportunities to use popsicle sticks will become rare, people will become even less willing to spend time and effort earning them. Too many tokens in circulation, then, can be just as destructive as too few.\"  Paul Krugman, 1997 accessed webpage 2010."

    "topic": "Is there a difference between managerial accounting and financial accounting?",
    "content": "From Wikipedia Managerial accounting is used primarily by those within a company or organization. Reports can be generated for any period of time such as daily, weekly or monthly. Reports are considered to be \"future looking\" and have forecasting value to those within the company. Financial accounting is used primarily by those outside of a company or organization. Financial reports are usually created for a set period of time, such as a fiscal year or period. Financial reports are historically factual and have predictive value to those who wish to make financial decisions or investments in a company. At my university, managerial accounting focused more on the details of how costs were managed in the company, the future of the business, etc. while the courses that were considered financial accounting were more from the point of view of a financial analyst or investor, like you said. The financial accountancy material covered analysis of financial statements and the associated investment decisions, among other things. These areas overlapped in areas like the production of financial statements, since the company also needs to consider how analysts will interpret these statements, and dividend policy, corporate tax accounting, etc. The Wikipedia articles on managerial accounting and financial accounting may provide helpful information as well. Disclaimer I took an introductory accounting course in university and nothing more, so my knowledge of the course structures, even at my alma mater, is secondhand recollection at best. Im sure there are more similarities and differences of which Im unaware, and I would assume that forensic accountants, auditors, etc. dabble in both these areas and others."

This might be easiest to conceptualise if you look at the option value as a function of the stock price, and then realise that the delta is the slope of that curve. Now, as we get closer to expiry, time value fades away, and we get closer and closer to the intrinsic value, which looks like this hockey stick  As you see, close to expiry, if youre out of the money, you have nothing with delta zero, while if youre in the money, you have a forward with delta one."

    "topic": "What options do I have at 26 years old, with 1.2 million USD?",
    "content": "The amount of money you have should be enough for you to live a safe but somewhat restricted life if you never worked again  but it could set you up for just about any sort of financial goal short of island buying if you do just about any amount of work. The basic math for some financial rules of thumb to keep in mind If your money is invested in very lowrisk ways, such as a money market fund, you might earn, say, 3 in interest every year. Thats 36k. But, if you withdraw that 36k every year, then every year you have the same principal amount invested. And a dollar tomorrow cant buy as much as a dollar today, because of inflation. If we assume for simplicity that inflation is 1 every year, then you need to contribute an additional 12k to your principal balance every year, just so that it has the same buying power next year. This leaves you with a net 24k of interest income that you can freely spend every year, for the rest of your life, without ever touching your principal balance. If your money is invested more broadly, including equity investments [stocks], you might earn, say, 7 every year. Some years you might lose money on your investments, and would need to draw down your principal balance to pay your bills. Some years you might do quite well  but would need to remain conservative and not withdraw your excess earnings every year, because you will need that excess to make up for the bad years. This would leave you with about 74k of income every year before inflation, and about 62k after inflation. But, you would be taking on more risk by doing this. If you work enough to pay your daily bills, and leave your investments alone to earn 7 on average annually, then in just 10 years your money would have doubled to  2.4 Million dollars. This assumes that you never save another penny, and spend everything you make. Its a level of financial security that means you could retire at a drop of the hat. And if dont start working for 20 years [which you might need to do if you spend in excess of your means and your money dries up], then the same will not be true  starting work at 45 with no savings would put you at a much greater disadvantage for financial security. Every year that you work enough to pay your bills before retirement could increase your nest egg by 7 [though again, there is risk here], but only if you do it now, while you have a nest egg to invest. Now in terms of what you should do with that money, you need to ask yourself what are your financial goals? You should think about this long and hard and renew that discussion with yourself periodically, as your goals will change over time. You say university isnt an option  but what other ways might you want to invest in yourself? Would you want to go on sabbaticaltype learning trips? Take a trade or learn a skill? Start a business? Do you want to live in the same place for 30 years [and thus maybe you should lockdown your housing costs by buying a house] or do you want to travel around the world, never staying in the same place twice [in which case you will need to figure out how to live cheaply and flexibly, without signing unnecessary leases]. If you want to live in the middle of nowhere eating ramen noodles and watching tv, you could do that without lifting a finger ever again. But every other financial goal you might have should be factored into your budget and work plan. And because you do have such a large degree of financial security, you have a lot of options that could be very appealing  every low paying but desirablehardtoget job is open to you. You can pursue your interests, even if they barely pay minimum wage, and doing so may help you ease into your new life easier than simply retiring at such a young age [when most of your peers will be heavy into their careers]. So, that is my strongest piece of advice  work now, while youre young and have motivation, so that you can dial back later. This will be much easier than the other way around. As for where you should invest your money in, look on this site for investing questions, and ultimately with that amount of money  I suggest you hire a paid advisor, who works based on an hourly consultation fee, rather than a  management fee. They can give you much more directed advice than the internet though you should learn it yourself as well, because that will give you the best piece of mind that you arent being taken advantage of."

For instance, some banks charge you a fee for checking accounts with a balance below a certain minimum, but will waive the fees for accounts with a higher balance. You may be able to avoid such fees by judicious management of your funds or by switching to a different bank, but its something to be aware of. The interest rates on savings accounts also often vary with the balance, making many small balances less efficient than one big balance. However, right now, at least in the US, interest rates on savings accounts are so low that the difference here is likely to be minimal."

    "content": "In my experience dealing with credit cards and store cards, you may find that the store card is much more flexible than the credit card in terms of the enforcement of the card agreement. For instance, Ive missed payments on credit cards and only been 1 day late and saw a rate increase, but on a store card when the same thing happened, it was like they didnt even notice. Granted, this was a 100 store card with no VISAMC logo on it, and it was through their bank. This may not be true of all store cards and your experience may differ, but I felt like the store card was more of a tool for acquiring the merchandise and helping the store make a sale than it was for some big bank to make money off of my interest. With credit cards, you are the product, and the bank makes money purely from interest. The store, on the other hand, makes money from selling the product, and credit helps increase sales. My suggestion is to avoid credit altogether as all debt is risk, but if you must use credit, you may have a better experience with the store card. Of course, dont forget to consider the interest rates, payment plan, and other fees that may apply as they may affect your decision in terms of which to go with."

    "topic": "In your 20s how much money should you have and how to properly use  manage it?",
    "content": "If you are just barely scraping by on your current income, then you shouldnt be thinking about buying a car or house unless you can present at least to yourself clear evidence that doing so will actually lower your monthly expenses. Yes, there are times when even buying depreciating assets such as a car can lower your expenses, but you need to think hard about whether that is the case or if it is just something you want to get because you feel you \"should\". Remember the old adage that rich people buy themselves income streams investments that either earn money or reduce expenses, while poor people buy expenses. If you are in the situation of barely scraping by on your current income, then the first step in my mind is to find out exactly what you are spending your money on do this for a month or two, and then try to include nonregular or rarelyoccuring bills such as subscriptions, insurance, perhaps utilities, and so on. Once you know where your money is going right now, outline that in a budget. At this point, you arent judging your spending, but rather simply looking at the facts. Once you have a decent idea of where your money is going, only then try to think about what you can cut back on. Some things will be easier than others to change its much easier to cancel a premium TV channels package than to move to cheaper living quarters, for example, although in some cases simply picking the lowhanging fruit alone wont help you. Make a revised budget for the next month based on the new numbers, and try to live by it. Keep writing down what you actually spend your money on, then rinse and repeat. Of course, you can make a budget for whatever period of time works for you if you get paid every two weeks, budgeting per two weeks might be easier than budgeting per month. The bottom line is that a budget is useless without a followup process to see how well your spending actually matches the budgeted amounts, so you need to spend some time following up on it and making adjustments. No budget will ever match reality exactly think of the budget as a map, not a footstepbyfootstep guide for getting from A to B. When you find some wiggle room in your budget for example, lets say you decide to cancel the premium TV channels package you got some time ago because it turns out you arent watching much TV anyway, dont put that money into a \"discretionary spending\" category. There is an old rule in personal finance that says pay yourself first. If you are able to find 5month of wiggle room, put it into savings of some kind. If you are unsure what kind of savings vehicle you should use, Id suggest starting off with a simple savings account it certainly wont earn you a great return youll be lucky if you can keep up with inflation, but it will get you into the habit of saving which at this point is a lot more important. And make that savings transfer as soon as the money hits your account. If you can, get the depositor to put a portion of your income directly into the savings account if you cannot, make the transfer yourself immediately afterwards. And try to force yourself to live with the money thats left, not touching the savings account. Ideally, you should save a decent fraction of your income  Ive seen figures everywhere from 10 to 25 of your aftertax income recommended by various people  and start out by budgeting that to savings and then working with whatever is left. In practice, saving anything and putting the money anywhere is much better than saving nothing. Just make sure that the savings are liquid easy to convert to cash and withdraw without a penalty, should the need arise, set up a regular bank transfer for whatever amount you can find in that budget, and try to forget about it until you get the bank statement for the savings account and get that warm, fuzzy feeling for actually having a decent amount of money set aside should something ever happen making you need it. Then, later, you can decide whether to use the money to buy a car, start a company, take early retirement, or something entirely different. Having the money will give you the options, and you can decide what is more important to you yourself. Just keep on saving."

    "content": "Wikipedia has a solid article on Money Market Funds which includes a section on \"Breaking the Buck\" when the money market fund fails to return its full dollar. Money market funds smoothing out the daily generally small fluctuations of investing in shortterm treasuries directly but have similar risk over longer periods. Some funds can and have lost money in market crashes, though even the worst performers still returned 95 cents on the dollar. While few investments are guaranteed and likely none in your retirement account, moneymarket funds are likely the choice you have with the least fluctuation and similar minimal risk to short term treasuries. However, a second important risk to consider is inflation. Money market funds generally have returns similar or less than the inflation rate. While money markets funds help you avoid the fluctuations of the stock market the value of your retirement account falls behind the cost of goods over time. Unless the investor is fairly old most financial professionals would recommend only a small portion of a retirement account be in money market instruments. Vanguard also has a set of target retirement investment funds that are close to what many professionals would recommend.

Cash value life insurance makes sense if If you you arent maxing out your retirement accounts, just stick with term insurance, and save as much as you can for retirement. Otherwise, if you have at least 5 or 10k extra after youve funded retirement for at least 7 years, one financial strategy is to buy a whole life policy from one of the big three mutual insurance firms. You buy a low face value policy, for example, say 50k face value the goal is to build cash value in the policy. Overload the policy by buying additional paid up insurance in the first 7 years of the policy, using a paidup addition rider of the policy. This policy will then grow its cash value at around 2 to 4 over the life of the policy....similar perhaps to the part of your portfolio that would would be in muni bonds basically you are beating inflation by a small margin. Further, as you dump money into the policy, the death benefit grows. After 7 or 8 years, the cash value of the policy should equal the money youve put into it, and your death benefit will have grown substantially maybe somewhere around 250k in this example. You can access the cash value by taking a policy loan you should only do this when it makes sense financially or in an emergency but the important thing to realize is that your cash is there, if you need it. So now you have insurance, you have your cash reserves. Why should you do this? You save up your cash and have access to it, and you get the insurance for \"free\" while still getting a small return on your investment. You are diversifying your financial portfolio, pushing some of your money into conservative investments."

Youve informed them of the error and theyve informed you that nevertheless the points are yours and you should use them. So you have a couple of issues have you made what your jurisdiction considers a reasonable effort to correct the mistake, and did the customer service rep actually have the authority to make such a large goodwill gesture as letting you keep all the points? The first is your legal responsibility otherwise youre stealing, and you need to know specifically for your jurisdiction whether a phone call is sufficient. I cant tell you that. Maybe you should send them a letter, maybe you should wait until youve had written confirmation from them, maybe youre OK as you are. You might be able to get free advice from some body that helps with consumer issues here in the UK you could ask Citizens Advice. The second is beyond your ability to know for sure but its not dishonest to work on the basis that what the companys proper representative tells you, is true. With the usual caveats that Im not qualified to give legal advice once told youve been clearly told that its an intentional gift, I dont see any way you could be held to have done anything fraudulent if you then go about enjoying it. The worst case \"far future\" problem, I would expect, is that someone decides the gift was never legitimately made in the first place. In other words the company made two separate errors, first crediting the card and then telling you the erroneous points stand. In that case you might have to pay them back whatever youve spent on the card beyond the points youre entitled to. To avoid this youd need to establish what constitutes a binding gift in your jurisdiction, so that you can say \"no, the point balance was not erroneous and heres the legal reason why\", and pay them nothing. You might also need to consider any tax implications in receiving such a large gift, and of course before paying tax on it if thats necessary youd probably want to bug them for confirmation in writing that it really is yours. If that written confirmation isnt forthcoming then so be it, theyve rescinded the gift and I doubt youre inclined to take them to court demanding that they stand by the words of their rep. Use them and play stupid. Its not my duty to check their math, right? Thats potentially fraud or theft if you lie. You did notice, and even worse they have proof you noticed since you made the call. So never say you didnt notice. If you hadnt called them yet, then youve been given something in error, and your jurisdiction will have an opinion on what your responsibilities are. So if you hadnt already called them, I would strongly suggest that you should call them or write to them about it to give them the opportunity to correct the error, or at least seek assurance that in your jurisdiction all errors in the customers favour are final. Otherwise youre in the position of them accidentally handing you their wallet without realising, and you deciding to keep it without telling them. My guess is, thats unlikely to be a legally binding gift, and might legally be theft or fraud on your part."

    "content": "Regarding auto insurance, you have to look at the different parts. In the United Sates most states do require a level of specific coverage for all drivers. That is to make sure that if you are at fault there is money available to pay the victims. That payment may be for damage to their car or other property, but it also covers medical costs. Many policies also cover you if the other driver doesnt have insurance. The policy that covers the loss of the vehicle is required if you have a loan or are leasing the car. Somebody else owns it while there is a loan, so they can and do require you to pay to protect the vehicle. If there i no loan you dont have to have that portion of a policy. Other parts such as towing, roadside assistance, and rental cars replacement may be required by the insurance standards for your state, or might be almost impossible to drop because all insurance companies include it to stay competitive with their competition. Dropping the nonrequired parts of the coverage is acceptable when you dont have a loan. Some people do drop it to save money. But that does mean you are self insuring. If you can afford to self insure a new car, great. The interesting thing is that some people have more than enough assets to self inure the nonrequired part of auto insurance. But then they realize that they do need to up their umbrella liability insurance. This is to protect them from somebody deciding that their resources make them a tempting target when they are involved in a collision."

    "topic": "how do capital gains work if you dont know the original purchase price?",
    "content": "There are two scenarios to determine the relevant date, and then a couple of options to determine the relevant price. If the stocks were purchased in your name from the start  then the relevant date is the date of the purchase. If the stocks were willed to you i.e. you inherited them, then the relevant date is the date at which the person who willed them to you had died. You can check with the company if they have records of the original purchase. If it was in \"street name\"  they may not have such records, and then you need to figure out what broker it was to hold them. Once you figured out the relevant date, contact the companys \"investor relationships\" contact and ask them for the adjusted stock price on that date adjusted for splitsmergersacquisitionswhatever. That would be the cost basis per share you would be using. Alternatively you can research historical prices on your favorite financial information site GoogleYahooBloomberg or the stock exchange where the company is listed. If you cannot figure the cost basis, or it costs too much  you can just write cost basis as 0, and claim the whole proceeds as gains. Youll pay capital gains tax on the whole amount, but that may end up being cheaper than conducting the investigation to reveal the actual numbers."

    "content": "Credit Scores  Rates are based on sometimes simple and sometimes quite complex Statistical Models Generalised Linear Models, Neural Networks, Regression and Classification Trees, Mixture Models, etc.This depends on whether it is something more general like FICO or what large banks develop inhouse. In any case, there are many legislationdependent factors Qualitative such as education, occupation security, sex, etc, payment history or Quantitative such as age, liquidity and leverage ratios, etc. Now, most model that are used today are propriety and closely held trade secrets. The most important reason for this is actually because of the databases that feed the models. More better quality data is what makes the real difference ... although at the cuttingedge, the mathematiciansstatisticianscomputer scientists that design the algorithms will make a huge difference. Now, back to the main thing The Credit ScoreRate is meant to be used only as an indicator for representing the Probability of Default \"How likely you are to default on your obligation towards me?\" is what it means and that is largely based upon \"Has companyheshe honoured his financial obligations?\" of a certain consumer. In more sophisticated models, they may also use your industry sector or occupational and financial security to predict the future behaviour. However, this \"Credit Score\" has meaning only in relation to a \"Credit Limit\" \"Can you pay back my X?\". The credit limit on the other hand is defined by your income level, debtasset, etc. As a credit risk analyst, whether we are dealing with large corporate loans, mortgages, personal loans, etc, the principles are the same One thing to consider is that factors considered in determining a credit score usually do not have a simple linear relationship. Consumer Profile types such as utilisation rate are a lot more about EFFECT than CAUSE The most important thing is to honour your obligations, whether you pay before or after you spend makes little difference, so long as you pay in full and prior to maturity, your ratescore will improve with time. Financial Institutions have many ways to make money of everyone. Some, such as interest rates and fees are directly charged to you and some are charged to your goodsandservices providers. That has no bearing on your score. Sometimes it even makes sense to take on customers with rockbottom ratings, lend them lots of money, and charge them to dirt. As you may well know, the recent financial crisis  with ongoing aftershocks and tremors  was the result of such practices."

Not as much as missing payments on the debt, which remains even if the credit line is closed, and not as much as missing payments on other bills... If so what can I do about it? Not very much. Nothing worth the time it would take. Like you mentioned, reopening the account or opening another would likely require a credit check and the inquiry will add another negative factor. In this situation, consider the impact on your credit as fact and the best way to correct it is to move forward and pay all your bills on time. This is the number one key to improving credit score. So, right now, the key task is finding a new job. This will enable you to make all payments on time. If you pay on time and do not overspend, your credit score will be fine. Can I contact the creditors to appeal the decision and get them to not affect my score at the very least? I know they wont restore the account without another credit check. Is there anything that can be done directly with the credit score companies? Depending on how they characterize the closing of the account, it may be mostly a neutral event that has a negative impact than a negative event. By negative events, Im referring to bankruptcy, charge offs, and collections. So the best way to recover is to keep credit utilization below 30 and pay all your bills and debt payments on time. You seem to be asking how to replace this line of credit to help you through your unemployment. As for the missing credit line and your current finances, you have to find a way forward. Opening new credit account while youre not employed is going to be very difficult, if not impossible. You might find yourself in a situation where you need to take whatever part time gig you can find in order to make ends meet until your job search is complete. Grocery store, fast food, wait staff, delivery driver, etc. And once you get past this period of unemployment, youll need to catch up on all bills, then youll want to build your emergency fund. You dont mention one, but eating, paying rentmortgage, keeping current on bills, and paying debt payments are the reasons behind the emergency fund, and the reason you need it in a liquid account. Source Im a veteran of decades of bad choices when it comes to money, of being unemployed for periods of time, of overusing credit cards, and generally being irresponsible with my income and savings. Ive done all those things and am now paying the price. In order to rebuild my credit, and provide for my retirement, Im having to work very hard to save. My focus being financial health, not credit score, Ive brought my bottom line from approximately 25k in the red up to about 5k in the red. The first step was getting my payments under control. I have also been watching my credit score. Two years of on time mortgage payments, gradual growth of score. Paid off student loans, uptick in score. Opened new credit card with 0 intro rate to consolidate a couple of store line of credit accounts. Transferred those balances. Big uptick. Next month when utilization on that card hits 90, downtick that took back a years worth of gains. However, financially, Im not losing 50100 a month to interest. TLDR At certain times, you have to ignore the credit score and focus on the important things. This is one of those times for you. Find a job. Get back on your feet. Then look into living debt free, or working to achieve financial independence."

    "content": "The problems with ratings and the interpretation of ratings is that they are retrospective, and most people read them as prospective. They basically tell you that debtor is solvent right now. What does that mean? It means that the ratings are based on the audited financial statements of a company, government or other organization issuing debt. So, in the best case scenario where the rating agency is acting properly, they are still dependent on folks with fiduciary responsibility telling the truth. And even if they are telling the \"truth\", accounting rules make it possible to obscure problems for years in some cases. Municipal goverments are a great example of this... the general obligation bonds cities and even states with deep structural budget problems still get good ratings, because they are solvent and have sufficient operating cash to meet obligations today. But towards the end of a 30year bonds life, that may not be the case anymore unless they dramatically alter their budgets. At the end of the day, ratings are one aspect of due diligence. They are useful screening devices, but you need to understand who you are lending money to by purchasing bonds and diversify your holdings to protect your wealth. The problem, of course, is when the trustees of your pension fund invests in garbage assets after getting a sales pitch on the beach in Hawaii, then conveniently place all of the blame for that bad investment on the rating agency.

If I go to a deli and ask for a sandwich. I give them tokens for the favor of having received a sandwich. The people at the deli then exchange those tokens for other favors, and thats the entire economy people doing favors for other people in exchange for tokens that represent more favors. Sometimes being invested in your spouse is giving them a back rub when theyve had a hard day. The investment pays off when you have a hard day and they give you a back rub. Sometimes being invested in your spouse is taking them to a masseuse for a professional massage. The investment pays off when they get two tickets to that thing you love. At the small scale its easy to mostly ignore minor monetary discrepancies. At the large scale which I think 50k is plenty large enough given your listed net worth it becomes harder to tell if the opportunity cost will be worth making that investment. It pretty much comes down to Will the qualityoflife improvements from that investment be better than the qualityoflife improvements you receive from investing that money elsewhere? As far as answering your actual question of How should I proceed? There isnt a onesize fits all answer to this. It comes down to decisions you have to make, such as  in theory its easy to say that everyone should be able to trust their spouse, but in practice there are a lot of people who are very bad at handling money. It can be worthwhile in some instances to keep your spouse at an arms length from your finances for their own good, such as if your spouse has a gambling addiction. With all of that said, it sounds like youre living in a 1.5m house rentfree. How much of an opportunity cost is that to your wife? Has she been freely investing in your wellbeing with no explicit expectation of being repaid? This can be your chance to provide a return on her investment. If it were me, Id make the investment in my spouse, and consider it \"rent\" while enjoying the improvements to my quality of life that come with it."

You use the money to buy a property that you expect will rise in value andor provide rent income that is larger than the mortgage payment. Doing some renovations can help the value rise. You sell the property, pay back the loan and get the profits. If you are fast, you might be able to do this even before the first mortgage payment is due. So yeah, 0 of your own cash invested.

    "content": "The new mortgage qualification rules were introduced to cool a hot Canadian housing real estate market. The rules are a preemptive measure intended to avoid a bubble and later crash in real estate. The government wants to make sure anybody buying a house can handle higher interest rates. Those rates, currently at record lows, are expected to go up later this year and into the future. The tighter mortgage rules include Borrowers will need to qualify against a minimum standard 5year fixed rate mortgage, even if theyll contract their mortgage at a lower or variable rate. Previously, the 3year fixed rate mortgage was used as the minimum qualification standard. The amount a homeowner can borrow in a refinanced mortgage drops to 90 of the home value, down from 95 of the home value. A home is not meant to be an ATM machine. Anybody wanting to borrow to buy an investment property  i.e. a property that wont be their principal residence  will need a 20 downpayment instead of a 5 downpayment. The new rules go into effect April 19th, 2010. However, according to the backgrounder see below Exceptions would be allowed after April 19 where they are needed to satisfy a binding purchase and sale, financing, or refinancing agreement entered into before April 19, 2010. Definitive information about the new rules can be found at the Department of Finance of Canada. Specifically, refer to Some additional news media sources"

    "content": "If the billing cycle is 2 to 3 months, it would mean Banks have to give credit for a longer period and it makes the entire business less profitable as well as more risky compared to the Monthly billing cycle. For example the current monthly billing cycle with a date say of 14th, means if you swipe your card on 1st day, one would effectively get a credit for 3014, around 44 days. If you swipe on last day, one would get a credit for 14 days. On an average 22 days of credit. If we make this 3 months, the credit period would increase on an average 90142, 52 days. From a risk point of view, on monthly cycle if there is nonpayment its flagged much earlier compared to a 3 months cycle. On offering different dates, shop around. In the older times the cycles were different, however with individuals having several cards, and trying to optimize every purchase to maximize credit period. Quite a few banks have streamlined it to monthly cycle. Shop around and some banks should be able to offer you different dates."

    "topic": "After consulting HR Block, are you actually obligated to file your taxes with them, if theyve found ways to save you money?",
    "content": "This is a legal issue, or possibly an ethical issue, and not really a finance issue. And I am not a lawyer. But for what its worth Did you sign a written contract with HR Block? If so, then the terms of that contract would govern. If you signed a contract saying that you agree to file your taxes through them if they meet suchandsuch conditions, and they met these conditions, then you are legally obligated. If there was no written contract, then I think any court would take the conversation between you and HR Block as an oral contract. If HR Block said, basically, \"Okay, well calculate what we think your taxes are, and if we come up with something better than what you had before, then you agree to file your taxes through us\", and you said \"Oh, okay\", then thats an oral contract. You agreed to their conditions. Legally, oral contracts are just as binding as written contracts. The only difference is that it is difficult to prove exactly what was said. If you really did agree to these conditions, I suppose you could lie and say you didnt and then try to convince a court that they are the ones lying. Obvious ethical problems there. There are also implied contracts. If HRBs advertising or paperwork says that youre agreeing to file through them if they meet the conditions, I thing that a court would likely rule that you implicitly agreed to their terms by doing the review. In any case, when you go to some place like HRB mostly what you are paying for is their knowledge and expertise. So if they give you the benefit of their expertise  they tell you how to reduce your taxes  and then you dont pay them, that seems rather unethical to me. The situation is muddied by the fact that you paid 100 for the review. Is that paying for the basic information, the \"tax tip\", and paying for them to file is then a contract for additional work? Under some circumstances Id say yes, thats additional work and thus an additional contract, so in the absence of a contract obligating me, I dont have to do that. The catch in this case is that at that point they must have already pretty much taken all your information and filled out all the forms.

Their conclusion was that while base cost of living was lower, the cost of the things that they enjoy doing  not to mention the cost of spending time with friends they didnt want to give up  would be sufficiently higher to erase most of the advantages. Those of us who grew up in or close to cities feel much the same way about moving out to lesspopulated and lessexpensive parts of our own country. Basically, when cost of living is high it tends to be because there are more people who want to live there and are competing for resources and driving prices up. Low cost of living is generally tied to lessdesired locations, for the same reasons. IF you can find a location that appeals to you, and if you can get the resources there which your preferred lifestyle requires, this may make sense.

Currency markets are more global and there is no one place where trades happen. There are multiple places where it happens and is loosely called Fx market place. Building a matching engine is also complex and confusing. If we go with your example of currency pair, matches would be difficult. Say If we were to say all transactions happen in USD say, and list every currency as item to be purchased or sold. I could put a trade Sell Trade for Quantity 100 Stock Code EUR at Price 1.13 [Price in USD]. So there has to be a buy at a price and we can match. Similarly we would have Stock Code for GBP, AUD, JPY, etc. Since not every thing would be USD based, say I need to convert GBP to EUR, I would have to have a different set of Base currency say GBP. So here the quantity would All currencies except GBP which would be price. Even then we have issues, someone using USD as base currency has quoted for Stock GBP.

For instance, with 4,000 you could EASILY control 40,000 with many brokers, at a 1 interest rate. This is 101 leverage, much like how US banks operate... every dollar that you deposit with them, they speculate with 10x as much. Interactive Brokers will do this for you with your current credit score. They are very reputable and clear through Goldman Sachs, so although reputable is subjective in the investment banking world, you wont have to worry the federal government raiding them or anything. If you are investing in currencies than you can easily do 501 leverage as an American, or 1001 as anyone else. This means with only 400 dollars you can control 40,000 account. If you are investing in the futures market, then there are many many ways to double and triple and quadruple your leverage at the lowest interests rates. Any contract you enter into is a loan from the market. You have to understand, that if you did happen to have 40,000 of your own money, then you could get 4,000,000 account size for speculating, at 1 interest. Again, these are QUICK ways to lose your money and owe a lot more! So Id really advise against it. A margin call in the futures market can destroy you. I advise you to just think more efficiently until you come up with a way to earn that much money initially, and then speculate."

All this leads to one thing At your age you should be looking to increase your income. No matter if it is college or a high paying trade, whatever you can do to increase your life time earning potential would be the best investment for this money. I would advocate a more patient approach. Stick the money in the bank until you complete your education enough for an \"adult job\". Use it, if needed, for training to get that adult job. Get a car, a place of your own, and a sufficient enough wardrobe. Save an emergency fund. Then invest with impunity. Imagine two versions of yourself. One with basic education, a average to below average salary, that uses this money to invest in the stock market. Eventually that money will be needed and it will probably be pulled out of the market at an in opportune time. It might worth less than the original 3K! Now imagine a second version of yourself that has an above average salary due to some good education or training. Perhaps that 3K was used to help provide that education. However, this second version will probably earn 25,000 to 75,000 per year then the first version. Which one do you want to be? Which one do you think will be wealthier?

While I cannot specifically speak to Canadian business practices, I have to imagine that in terms of credit history as a prerequisite to a lease, it cant be too different than America. It is possible to live without a credit score. This is typically done by those with enough resources that do not need to borrow money. To make transactions that commonly use credit scores, such as a lease, they will provide personal financial statements balance sheets, personal income statements, bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, etc... to show that they are creditworthy. References from prior landlords may also be beneficial. Again, the caveat is to elect to only conduct business with those individuals and institutions that are intelligent and rational enough to be able to analyze your financial position and ability to pay without a credit score.

Covered calls are a good choice for someone who already owns the stock, because the premium collected reduces the cost basis for the position. The downside is that if the calls are exercised, there is a good chance that you are missing out on additional upside in the stock price because the strike is obviously below the market value for the stocks. Another good option trade is the spread option. This would allow you to capture the difference between the two strikes of the options in the spread.

    "content": "You have a few correlated questions here Yes you can. There are only a few investment strategies that require a minimum contribution and those arent ones that would get a blanket recommendation anyway. Investing in bonds or stocks is perfectly possible with limited funds. Youre never too young to start. The power of interest means that the more time you give your money to grow, the larger your eventual gains will be provided your investment is beating inflation. If your financial situation allows it, it makes sense to invest money you dont need immediately, which brings us to This is the one you have to look at most. Youre young but have a nice chunk of cash in a savings account. That money wont grow much and you could be losing purchasing power to inflation but on the other hand that money also isnt at risk. While there are dozens of investment options1 the two main ones to look at are bonds these are fixed income, which means theyre fairly safe, but the downside is that you need to lock up your money for a long time to get a better interest rate than a savings account index funds that track the market these are basically another form of stock where each share represents fractions of shares of other companies that are tracked on an index such as the SP 500 or Nasdaq. These are much riskier and more volatile, which is why you should look at this as a longterm investment as well because given enough time these are expected to trend upwards. Look into index funds further to understand why. But this isnt so much about what you should invest in, but more about the fact that an investment, almost by definition, means putting money away for a long period of time. So the real question remains how much can you afford to put away? For that you need to look at your individual situation and your plans for the future. Do you need that money to pay for expenses in the coming years? Do you want to save it up for college? Do you want to invest and leave it untouched to inspire you to keep saving? Do you want to save for retirement? Im not sure if you can start saving via IRAs and the like at your age but its worth looking into. Or do you want to spend it on a dream holiday or a car? There are arguments to be made for every one of those. Most people will tell you to keep such a \"low\" sum in a savings account as an emergency fund but that also depends on whether you have a safety net i.e. parents and how reliable they are. Most people will also tell you that your longterm money should be in the stock market in the form of a balanced portfolio of index funds. But I wont tell you what to do since you need to look at your own options and decide for yourself what makes sense for you. Youre off to a great start if youre thinking about this at your age and Id encourage you to take that interest further and look into educating yourself on the investments options and funds that are available to you and decide on a financial plan. Involving your parents in that is sensible, not in the least because your posthigh school plans will be the most important variable in said plan. To recap my first point and answer your main question, if youve decided that you want to invest and youve established a specific budget, the size of that investment budget should not factor into what you invest it in. 1  For the record penny stocks are not an investment. Theyre an expensive form of gambling."

For example, try the symbols MUTHX, EDITX, AWSHX and youll see that the Risk Grades on the graphs are seriously in error, and compress the graph results and cause overwriting and poor readability. If anyone knows of a similar product, Id like to know about it. Thanks, George"

    "topic": "Is there an application or website where I can practice trading US stocks with virtual money? ",
    "content": "I traded futures for a brief period in school using the BrokersXpress platform now part of OptionsXpress, which is in turn now part of Charles Schwab. They had a virtual trading platform, and apparently still do, and it was excellent. Since my main account was enabled for futures, this carried over to the virtual account, so I could trade a whole range of futures, options, stocks, etc. I spoke with OptionsXpress, and you dont need to fund your acount to use the virtual trading platform. However, they will cancel your account after an arbitrary period of time if you dont log in every few days. According to their customer service, there is no inactivity fee on your main account if you dont fund it and make no trades. I also used StockTrak for a class and despite finding the occasional bug or website performance issue, it provided a good experience. I received a discount because I used it through an educational institution, and customer service was quite good probably for the same reason, but I dont know if those same benefits would apply to an individual signing up for it. I signed up for top10traders about seven years ago when I was in secondary school, and its completely free. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for, and the interface was poorly designed and slow. Furthermore, at that time, there were no restrictions that limited the number of shares you could buy to the number of outstanding shares, so you could buy as many as you could afford, even if you exceeded the number that physically existed. While this isnt an issue for large companies, it meant you could earn a killing trading highly illiquid pink sheet stocks because you could purchase billions of shares of companies with only a few thousand shares actually outstanding. I dont know if these issues have been corrected or not, but at the time, I and several other users took advantage of these oversights to rack up hundreds of trillions of dollars in a matter of days, so if you want a realistic simulation, this isnt it. Investopedia also has a stock simulator that Ive heard positive things about, although I havent used it personally."

    "content": "Does the Insurance value differ from state to state for example Ive a car in Hawaii and there is another car in Illinois with same model, make and same features, does the Insurance vary for both? Yes, quotes will vary based on where you live for various reasons, propensity for accidents, value of cars, etc., and state laws regarding required car insurance can vary. How is the insurance quote calculated? Its likely a proprietary formula that the insurance company will not disclose. If they did, they could be giving away a competitive advantage. However, like all insurance, the goal is to determine the probability of the insured having an accident, and the projected cost of such an accident. That will be based on actuarial tables for each of the risk factors you mention."

    "topic": "Can you explain time value of money and compound interest and provide examples of each?",
    "content": "Time Value of Money  The simple calculation for this is FV  PV  1rN which reads The Future Value is equal to the Present Value times 1 plus the interest rate multiplied by itself by the number of periods that will pass. A simple way to look at this is that if interest rates were 5yr a dollar would be worth 1.05N where N is the number of years passing. The concept of compound interest cannot be separated from the above. Compounding is accounting for the interest on the interest that has accrued in prior periods. If I lend you a dollar at 6 simple interest for 30 years, you would pay me back 1  1.80 or 2.80. But  1.0630  5.74 so that dollar compounded at 6 annually for 30 years is 5.74. Quite a difference. Often, the time value of money is discussed in light of inflation. A dollar today is not the same dollar as 30 years ago or 30 years hence. In fact, inflation has eroded the value of the dollar by a factor of 3 over the past 30 years. An average item costing 100 would now cost 300. So when one invests, at the very least they try to stay ahead of inflation and seek additional return for their risk. One quirk of compounding is the \"rule of 72.\" This rule states that if you divide the interest rate into the number 72 the result is the number of years to double. So 10 per year will take about 7.2 years to double, 8, 9 years, etc. Its not 100 precise, but a good \"back of napkin\" calculation. When people talk about the total payments over the thirty year life of a mortgage, they often ignore the time value of money. That payment even ten years from now has far less value than the same payment today."

    "topic": "What software do you recommend for Creating a ToThePenny, ToTheDay Budget?",
    "content": "I wrote a little program one time to try to do this. I think I wrote it in Python or something. The idea was to have a list of \"projected expenses\" where each one would have things like the amount, the date of the next transaction, the frequency of the transaction, and so on. The program would then simulate time, determining when the next transaction would be, updating balances, and so on. You can actually do a very similar thing with a spreadsheet where you basically have a list of expenses that you manually paste in for each month in advance. Simply keep a running balance of each row, and make sure you dont forget any transactions that should be happening. This works great for fixed expenses, or expenses that you know how much they are going to be for the next month. If you dont know, you can estimate, for instance you can make an educated guess at how much your electric bill will be the next month if you havent gotten the bill yet and you can estimate how much you will spend on fuel based on reviewing previous months and some idea of whether your usage will differ in the next month. For variable expenses I would always err on the side of a larger amount than I expected to spend. It isnt going to be possible to budget to the exact penny unless you lead a very simple life, but the extra you allocate is important to cushion unexpected and unavoidable overruns. Once you have this done for expenses against your bank account, you can see what your \"low water mark\" is for the month, or whatever time period you project out to. If this is above your minimum, then you can see how much you can safely allocate to, e.g. paying off debt. Throwing a credit card into the mix can make things a bit more predictable in the current month, especially for unpredictable amounts, but it is a bit more complicated as now you have a second account that you have to track that has to get deducted from your first account when it becomes due in the following month. I am assuming a typical card where you have something like a 25 day grace period to pay without interest along with up to 30 days after the expense before the grace period starts, depending on the relationship between your cutoff date and when the actual expense occurs."

    "topic": "Should an IRA be disclaimed to allow it to be distributed according to a will?",
    "content": "There are two different possible taxes based on various scenarios proposed by the OP or the lawyer who drew up the OPs fathers will or the OPs mother. First, there is the estate tax which is paid by the estate of the deceased, and the heirs get what is left. Most estates in the US pay no estate tax whatsoever because most estates are smaller than 5.4M lifetime gift and estate tax exemption. But, for the record, even though IRAs pass from owner to beneficiary independent of whatever the will might say about the disposition of the IRAs, the value of the deceaseds IRAs is part of the estate, and if the estate is large enough that estate tax is due and there is not enough money in the rest of the estate to pay the estate tax e.g. most of the estate value is IRA money and there are no other investments, just a bank account with a small balance, then the executor of the will can petition the probate court to claw back some of the IRA money from the IRA beneficiaries to pay the estate tax due. Second, there is income tax that the estate must pay on income received from the estates assets, e.g. mutual fund dividends paid between the date of death and the distribution of the assets to the beneficiaries, or income from cashing in IRAs that have the estate as the beneficiary. Now, most of OPs fathers estate is in IRAs which have the OPs mother as the primary beneficiary and there are no named secondary beneficiaries. Thus, by default, the estate is the IRA beneficiary should the OPs mother disclaim the IRAs as the lawyer has suggested. As JoeTaxpayer says in a comment, if the OPs mother disclaims the IRA, then the estate must distribute all the IRA assets to the three beneficiaries by December 31 of the year in which the fifth anniversary of the death occurs. If the estate decides to do this by itself, then the distribution from the IRA to the estate is taxable income to the estate best avoided if possible because of the high tax rates on trusts. What is commonly done is that before December 31 of the year following the year in which the death occurred, the estate as the beneficiary informs the IRA Custodian that the estates beneficiaries are the surviving spouse 50, and the two children 25 each and requests the IRA custodian to divide the IRA assets accordingly and let each beneficiary be responsible for meeting the requirements of the 5year rule for hisher share. Any assets not distributed in timely fashion are subject to a 50 excise tax as penalty each year until such time as these monies are actually withdrawn explicitly from the IRA that is, the excise tax is not deducted from the remaining IRA assets the beneficiary has to pay the excise tax out of pocket. As far as the IRS is concerned, there are no yearly distribution requirements to be met but the IRA Custodial Agreement might have its own rules, and so Publication 590b recommends discussing the distribution requirements for the 5year rule with the IRA Custodian. The money distributed from the IRA is taxable income to the recipients. In particular, the children cannot roll the money over into another IRA so as to avoid immediate taxation the spouse might be able to roll over the money into another IRA, but I am not sure about this Publication 590b is very confusing on this point. All this is assuming that the deceased passed away before well before his 70.5th birthday so that there are no issues with RMDs the interactions of all the rules in this case is an even bigger can of worms that I will leave to someone else to explicate. On the other hand, if the OPs mother does not disclaim the IRAs, then she, as the surviving spouse, has the option of treating the inherited IRAs as her own IRAs, and she could then name her two children as the beneficiaries of the inherited IRAs when she passes away. Of course, by the same token, she could opt to make someone else the beneficiary e.g, her children from a previous marriage or change her mind at any later time and make someone else the beneficiary e.g. if she remarries, or becomes very fond of the person taking care of her in a nursing home and decides to leave all her assets to this person instead of her children, etc. But even if such disinheritances are unlikely and the children are perfectly happy to wait to inherit till Mom passes away, as JoeTaxpayer points out, by not disclaiming the IRAs, the OPs mother can delay taking distributions from the IRAs till age 70.5, etc. which is also a good option to have. The worst scenario is for the OPs mother to not disclaim the IRAs, cash them in right away huge income tax whack on her or at least 50 of them, and gift the OP and his sibling half of what she withdrew or possibly after taking into account what she had to pay in income tax on the distribution. Gift tax need not be paid by the OPs mother if she files Form 709 and reduces her lifetime combined gift and estate tax exemption, and the OP and his sibling dont owe any tax income or otherwise on the gift amount. But, all that money has changed from taxdeferred assets to ordinary assets, and any additional earnings on these assets in the future will be taxable income. So, unless the OP and his sibling need the cash right away pay off credit card debt, make a downpayment on a house, etc, this is not a good idea at all."

    "topic": "When is the right time to buy a newemerging technology?",
    "content": "If youre looking for a purely financial answer ignoring the socialenvironmental aspects there are a few different ways you can look at it. For these types of improvements the simplest is a payback calculation. How long would it take you to recoup the initial costs? For example, if the entire installation cost 5,000 including any tax credits, and you save 100 per month Im making both numbers up, youll pay back your investment in 50 months, or about 4 years. Note that if you borrow money to do the improvement, then your payback period is longer because youre reducing the amount that youre saving each month by paying interest. If youre deciding between different uses for the money like investing, or paying down other debt then you can look at the return that youre getting. Using the same example, you are spending 5,000 and getting 100 per month back, for a 24 annual return 1,200  5,000, which is better than you can get on almost anything but a 401k match meaning dont stop your 401k contributions to do this either. The decision on whether or wait or not then becomes  will the price drop faster than the amount of savings you will realize. So if you will save 100 per month in your electric bill, is the price of the complete installation going down by more than 100 each month? If not, youd be better off buying now and start paying back the investment sooner."

Here is a great question with various viewpoints How to organize bank accounts with wife. It doesnt touch heavily on home ownership  prenuptial agreements, but might be a good starting point to getting you to think about your options. Consider providing another loan to your wife for additional investments in the home. It seems you are both comfortable with the realities of the prenuptial agreement one of those realities seems to be that in the event of divorce you would lose access to the house. Loaning money has the benefit of allowing for the improvements to be done immediately, while clearly delineating what you have spent on the home from what she has spent on the home. However, this may not be fair, depending on how you both define the term. Have you discussed how expenses and savings would be split between you? Since there is no mortgage on the house, she has effectively contributed her premarital assets towards paying substantially all of your housing costs. It may be fair for you to contribute to housing costs by at least splitting maintenance 5050, or it may not be. Hopefully you talked about finances before you got married, and if not, now would be the best time to start.

More important is that a recently revised edition of Intelligent Investor was published. The preface and appendix were written by Warren Buffett. Intelligent Investor is more practical as an introduction for a novice. You may decide not to read Security Analysis at all, as it seems more like an academic text or professionals guide i.e. for accounting. Benjamin Grahams Intelligent Investor remains relevant. It is used, successfully, as a guide for value investing, despite the hysteria of market sentiment and daytoday variations, even extreme volatility. For example, I just read a nice article about applying the value investing principles extolled in Intelligent Investor a few weeks ago. It was written in the context of current markets, which is amazing, to be so applicable, despite the passage of decades. For reference, you might want to glance at this book review published in March 2010! of the original 1934 edition of Security Analysis.

    "topic": "What happens to my savings if my country defaults or restructures its debt?",
    "content": "In theory, anything can happen, and the world could end tomorrow. However, with a reasonably sane financial plan you should be able to ride this out. If the government cannot or wont immediately pay its debt in full, the most immediate consequence is that people are going to be unwilling to lend any more money in future, except at very high rates to reflect the high risk of future default. Presumably the government has got into this state by running a deficit spending more than they collect in tax and that is going to have to come to an abrupt end. That means higher taxes, public service retrenchments and restrictions of service, perhaps cuts to social benefits, etc. Countries that get into this state typically also have banks that have lent too much money to risky customers. So you should also expect to see some banks get into trouble, which may mean customers who have money on deposit will have trouble getting it back. In many cases governments will guarantee deposits, but perhaps only up to a particular ceiling like 100k. It would be very possible to lose everything if you have speculative investments geared by substantial loans. If you have zero or moderate debt, your net wealth may decrease substantially 50? but there should be little prospect of it going to zero. It is possible governments will simply confiscate your property, but I think in a firstworld EU country this is fairly unlikely to happen to bank accounts, houses, shares, etc. Typically, a default has led to a fall in the value of the countrys currency. In the eurozone that is more complex because the same currency is used by countries that are doing fairly well, and because there is also turbulence in other major currency regions JPY, USD and GBP. In some ways this makes the adjustment harder, because debts cant be inflated down. All of this obviously causes a lot of economic turbulence so you can expect house prices to fall, share prices to gyrate, unemployment to rise. If you can afford it and come stomach the risk, it may turn out to be a good time to buy assets for the long term. If youre reasonably young the largest impact on you wont be losing your current savings, but rather the impact on your future job prospects from this adjustment period. You never know, but I dont think the Weimar Republic wheelbarrowsofbanknotes situation is likely to recur people are at least a bit smarter now and there is an inflationtargeting independent central bank. I think gold can have some room in a portfolio, but now is not the time to make a sudden drastic move into it. Most middle class people cannot afford to have enough gold to support them for the rest of their life, though they may have enough for a rainy day or to act as a balancing component. So what I would do to cope with this is be well diversified, be sufficiently conservatively positioned that I would sleep at night, and beyond that just ride it out and try not to worry too much."

    "topic": "What is the difference between fund and portfolio?",
    "content": "A \"Fund\" is generally speaking a collection of similar financial products, which are bundled into a single investment, so that you as an individual can buy a portion of the Fund rather than buying 50 portions of various products. e.g. a \"Bond Fund\" may be a collection of various corporate bonds that are bundled together. The performance of the Fund would be the aggregate of each individual item. Generally speaking Funds are like prepackaged \"diversification\". Rather than take time and fees to buy 50 different stocks on the same stock index, you could buy an \"Index Fund\" which represents the values of all of those stocks. A \"Portfolio\" is your individual package of investments. ie the 20k you have in bonds  the 5k you have in shares,  the 50k you have in \"Funds\"  the 100k rental property you own. You might split the definition further buy saying \"My 401k portfolio  my taxable portfolio  my real estate portfolio\"etc., to denote how those items are invested. The implication of \"Portfolio\" is that you have considered how all of your investments work together ie your 5k in stocks is not so risky, because it is only 5k out of your entire 185k portfolio, which includes some low risk bonds and funds. Another way of looking at it, is that a Fund is a special type of Portfolio. That is, a Fund is a portfolio, that someone will sell to someone else see Daniels answer below. For example Imagine you had 5,000 invested in IBM shares, and also had 5,000 invested in Apple shares. Call this your portfolio. But you also want to sell your portfolio, so lets also call it a fund. Then you sell half of your fund to a friend. So your friend lets call him Maurice pays you 4,000, to invest in your Fund. Maurice gives you 4k, and in return, you given him a note that says \"Maurice owns 40 of atp9s Fund\". The following month, IBM pays you 100 in dividends. But, Maurice owns 40 of those dividends. So you give him a cheque for 40 some funds automatically reinvest dividends for their clients instead of paying them out immediately. Then you sell your Apple shares for 6,000 a gain of 1,000 since you bought them. But Maurice owns 40 of that 6k, so you give him 2,400 or perhaps, instead of giving him the money immediately, you reinvest it within the fund, and buy 6k of Microsoft shares. Why would you set up this Fund? Because Maurice will pay you a fee equal to, lets say, 1 of his total investment. Your job is now to invest the money in the Fund, in a way that aligns with what you told Maurice when he signed the contract. ie maybe its a tech fund, and you can only invest in big Tech companies. Maybe its an Index fund, and your investment needs to exactly match a specific portion of the New York Stock Exchange. Maybe its a bond fund, and you can only invest in corporate bonds. So to reiterate, a portfolio is a collection of investments think of an artists portfolio, being a collection of their work. Usually, people refer to their own portfolio, of personal investments. A fund is someones portfolio, that other people can invest in. This allows an individual investor to give some of their decision making over to a Fund manager. In addition to relying on expertise of others, this allows the investor to save on transaction costs, because they can have a welldiversified portfolio see what I did there? while only buying into one or a few funds."

    "content": "I would always suggest rolling over 401k plans to traditional IRAs when possible. Particularly, assuming there is enough money in them that you can get a feefree account at somewhere like Fidelity or Vanguard. This is for a couple of reasons. First off, it opens up your investment choices significantly and can allow you significantly reduced expenses related to the account. You may be able to find a superior offering from Vanguard or Fidelity to what your employers 401k plan allows typically they only allow a small selection of funds to choose from. You also may be able to reduce the overhead fees, as many 401k plans charge you an administrative fee for being in the plan separate from the funds costs. Second, it allows you to condense 401ks over time each time you change employers, you can rollover your 401k to your regular IRA and not have to deal with a bunch of different accounts with different passwords and such. Even if theyre all at the same provider, odds are you will have to use separate accounts. Third, it avoids issues if your employer goes out of business. While 401k plans are generally fully funded particularly for former employers who you dont have match or vesting concerns with, it can be a pain sometimes when the plan is terminated to access your funds  they may be locked for months while the bankruptcy court works things out. Finally, employers sometimes make it expensive for you to stay in  particularly if you do have a very small amount. Dont assume youre allowed to stay in the former employers 401k plan feefree the plan will have specific instructions for what to do if you change employers, and it may include being required to leave the plan  or more often, it could increase the fees associated with the plan if you stay in. Getting out sometimes will save you significantly, even with a lowcost plan."

Theres a number called the reserve requirement which limits how much money each bank can create. Lowering the reserve requirement allows banks to create more money. Raising it will destroy money. But banks can also destroy money by calling in loans or being less willing to make new loans.

The Federal Reserve Central Bank is \"buying back\" US Govt debt to keep rates low, and the government is keeping mortgage rates low buy buying mortgages with the proceeds of the cheap bond sales. While this isnt directly related to Australia, it is relevant because the largest capital markets are in the US and influence the markets in Australia. In the US, the CPI is a survey of all urban consumers. If youre a younger, middle class consumer with income growth ahead of you, your costs are going to shift more rapidly than an elderly or poor person who already owns or is in subsidized housing, and doesnt spend as much on transportation. For example, my parents are in their early 60s and are living in the house that I grew up in, which they own free and clear.

If, on the other hand, you just think that the overall bill is too expensive then you really only have one option. You can ask if they will reduce the bill for you. Most hospitals and clinics Ive dealt with have programs set up for this, but you usually access them by filling out paperwork demonstrating financial hardship along with supporting documents. It never hurts to ask. But with the services already rendered the only person with an interest in reducing the bill is you. The reduction, if any, will probably depend on what the clinic thinks your ability to pay is compared with the cost to them of pursuing you for payment, as well as the amount of funding they have for bill reduction. When I worked in the financial services office of a hospital a 400 bill would not even have been reviewed for discounting the balance would be too low to devote staff time to reviewing. Its frustrating, and even asking in advance might not have given you accurate or any! information on what the cost of the visit would be, so your ability to shop around is limited. Unfortunately, that doesnt give you any additional options in this case."

I would argue that any investment you do not understand is risky and allows you to lose money at a more rapid rate than someone who understands the investment. The way to reduce risk is to learn about what you want to invest in before you invest in it. Learning afterward can be a very expensive proposition, possibly costing you your retirement. Warren Buffet told the story on Bloomberg Radio in late 2013 of how he read everything in his local library on investing as a teenager and when his family moved to Washington he realized he had the entire Library of Congress at his disposal. One of Mr. Buffetts famous quotes when asked why he doesnt invest in the tech sector was \"I dont invest in what I do not understand.\". There are several major asset classes Paper stocks, bonds, mutual funds, currency, Commodities silver, gold, oil, Businesses creation, purchase or partnership as opposed to common stock ownership and Real Estate rental properties, flips, land development. Pick one that interests you and learn everything about it that you can before investing. This will allow you to minimize and mitigate risks while increasing the rewards."

    "content": "It surely doesnt HURT to keep a receipt. I tend to pile up receipts in my desk drawer, never look at them, and then every few months throw them all out. If a vendor writes a receipt by hand or if the cash register is not tied in to the credit card system, keeping a receipt could give you evidence against mistakes or fraud. Like if the vendor gives you a receipt for 10 and then sends a transaction to the credit card company for 20, you could use the receipt as evidence of the problem. But if the vendor is trying to really cheat you, the most likely thing for him to do is run the legitimate transaction through, and then some time later run a fake transaction. So say today you go to vendor X, buy something for 20, and he bills your credit card 20. Then a few days later he bills you another 100 even though you never came back to the store. Sure, you have a receipt for 20. But you dont have a receipt for the 100 because you never authorized that transaction. Your receipt proves nothing  presumably youre not disputing the 20. If you complain to the bank or go to the police or whatever, saying, \"Hey look, I dont have a receipt for the 100\" doesnt prove anything. How do they know you didnt just throw it away? Its difficult to prove that you never had such a receipt."

    "topic": "Why is shortselling considered more advanced than a simple buy?",
    "content": "In addition to the higher risk as pointed out by JamesRoth, you also need to consider that there are regulations against naked shorting so you generally need to either own the security, or have someone that is willing to loan the security to you in order to sell short. If you own a stock you are shorting, the IRS could view the transaction as a Sell followed by a buy taking place in a less than 30 day period and you could be subject to washsale rules. This added complexity most often the finding of someone to loan you the security you are shorting is another reason such trades are considered more advanced. You should also be aware that there are currently a number of proposals to reinstate the uptick rule or some circuitbreaker variant. Designed to prevent shortsellers from driving down the price of a stock and conducting bear raids etc the first requires that a stock trade at the same or higher price as prior trades before you can submit a short. In the latter shorting would be prohibited after a stock price had fallen a given percentage in a given amount of time. In either case, should such a rule be reestablished then you could face limitations attempting to execute a short which you would not need to worry about doing simple buys or sells. As to vehicles that would do this kind of thing if you are convinced we are in a bear market and willing to take the risk there are a number of ETFs classified as Inverse Exchange Traded Funds ETFs for a variety of markets that via various means seek to deliver a return similar to that of shorting the market in question. One such example for a common broad market is ticker SH the ProShares Short SP500 ETF, which seeks to deliver a return that is the inverse of the SP500 and as would be predicted based on the roughly 15 performance of the SP500 over the last 12 months, SH is down roughly 15 over the same period. The Wikipedia article on inverse ETFs lists a number of other such funds covering various markets. I think it should be noted that using such a vehicle is a pretty aggressive bet to take in reaction to the belief that a bear market is imminent. A more conservative approach would be to simply take money out of the market and place it in something like CDs or Treasury instruments. In that case, you preserve your capital, regardless of what happens in the market. Using an inverse ETF OTOH means that if the market went bull instead of bear, you would lose money instead of merely holding your position."

For example, my first car was constantly falling apart and was an SUV that got 16MPG. I have to travel for work about 300 miles per week so getting a sedan that averages close to 40MPG saves me more in gas and maintenance than the monthly payment for the new car costs. When our apartment lease was up, the new monthly rent would have been 1685 per month, we got a 30 year mortgage with a monthly payment of 1372. So buying a house actually let us put aside more each month. We have just under 3 months of living expenses set aside 1 month in liquid assets, 2 months in a brokerage account and I worry about it. I wish we had a better buffer, but in our case the house and car made more sense as an early investment compared to just squirreling away all our savings. Also, do you have any debt? Paying off debt student loans, credit card debt, etc. should often take top priority. Have some rainy day funds, of course, but pay down debts, and then create a personal financial plan for what works best in your situation. That would be my suggestion."

    "topic": "Bidask spreads for index funds",
    "content": "First, what structure does your index fund have? If it is an openend mutual fund, there are no bidask spread as the structure of this security is that it is priced once a day and transactions are done with that price. If it is an exchangetraded fund, then the question becomes how well are authorized participants taking advantage of the spread to make the fund track the index well? This is where you have to get into the Creation and Redemption unit construct of the exchangetraded fund where there are \"inkind\" transactions done to either create new shares of the fund or redeem out shares of the fund. In either case, you are making some serious assumptions about the structure of the fund that dont make sense given how these are built. Index funds have lower expense ratios and are thus cheaper than other mutual funds that may take on more costs. If you want suggested reading on this, look at the investing books of John C. Bogle who studied some of this rather extensively, in addition to being one of the first to create an index fund that became known as \"Bogles Folly,\" where a couple of key ones would be \"Common Sense on Mutual Funds New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor\" and \"Bogle on Mutual Funds New Perspectives for the Intelligent Investor.\" In the case of an openend fund, there has to be a portion of the fund in cash to handle transaction costs of running the fund as there are management fees to come from running the fund in addition to dividends from the stocks that have to be carefully reinvested and other matters that make this quite easy to note. Vanguard 500 Index Investor portfolioVFINX has .38 in cash as an example here where you could look at any openend mutual funds portfolio and notice that there may well be some in cash as part of how the fund is managed. Its the Execution, Stupid would be one of a few articles that looks at the idea of \"tracking error\" or how well does an index fund actually track the index where it can be noted that in some cases, there can be a little bit of active management in the fund. Just as a minor side note, when I lived in the US I did invest in index funds and found them to be a good investment. Id still recommend them though Id argue that while some want to see these as really simple investments, there can be details that make them quite interesting to my mind. How is its price set then? The price is computed by taking the sum value of all the assets of the fund minus the liabilities and divided by the number of outstanding shares. The price of the assets would include the closing price on the stock rather than a bid or ask, similar pricing for bonds held by the fund, derivatives and cash equivalents. Similarly, the liabilities would be costs a fund has to pay that may not have been paid yet such as management fees, brokerage costs, etc. Is it a weighted average of all the underlying stock spreads, or does it stand on its own and stems from the usual supply  demand laws ? There isnt any spread used in determining the \"Net Asset Value\" for the fund. The fund prices are determined after the market is closed and so a closing price can be used for stocks. The liabilities could include the costs to run the fund as part of the accounting in the fund, that most items have to come down to either being an asset, something with a positive value, or a liability, something with a negative value. Something to consider also is the size of the fund. With over 7,000,000,000 in assets, a .01 amount is still 700,000 which is quite a large amount in some ways."

    "topic": "Calculating pay off for credit card with multiple APRs",
    "content": "Joes original answer and the example with proportionate application of the payment to the two balances is not quite what will happen with US credit cards. By US law CARD Act of 2009, if you make only the minimum required payment or less, the creditcard company can choose which part of the balance that sum is applied to. I am not aware of any company that chooses to apply such payments to anything other than that part of the balance which carries the least interest rate including the 0 rate that \"results\" from acceptance of balance transfer offers. If you make more than the minimum required payment, then the excess must, by law, be applied to paying off the highest rate balance. If the highest rate balance gets paid off completely, any remaining amount must be applied to secondhighest rate balance, and so on. Thus, it is not the case that that 600 payment in Joes example is applied proportionately to the 5000 and 1000 balances owed. It depends on what the required minimum payment is. So, what would be the minimum required payment? The minimum payment is the total of i all finance charges incurred during that month, ii all service fees and penalties e.g. fee for exceeding credit limit, fee for taking a cash advance, late payment penalty and other charges e.g. annual card fee and iii a fraction of the outstanding balance that by law must be large enough to allow the customer to pay off the entire balance in a reasonable length of time. The law is silent on what is reasonable, but most companies use 1 which would pay off the balance over 8.33 years. Consider the numbers in Joes example together with the following assumptions 5000 and 1000 are the balances owed at the beginning of the month, no new charges or service fees during that month, and the previous months minimum monthly payment was made on the day that the statement paid so that the finance charge for the current month is on the balances stated. The finance charge on the 5000 balance is 56.25, while the finance charge on the 1000 balance is 18.33, giving a minimum required payment of 56.2518.3360  134.58. Of the 600 payment, 134.58 would be applied to the lowerrate balance 5000  56.25  5056.25 and reduce it to 4921.67. The excess 465.42 would be applied to the highrate balance of 100018.33  1018.33 and reduce it to 552.91. In general, it is a bad idea to take a cash advance from a credit card. Dont do it unless you absolutely must have cash then and there to buy something from a merchant who does not accept credit cards, only cash, and dont be tempted to use the \"convenience checks\" that creditcard companies send you from time to time. All such cash advances not only carry larger rates of interest there may also be upfront fees for taking an advance but any purchases made during the rest of the month also become subject to finance charge. In other words, there is no \"grace period\" for new charges, and this state of affairs will last for one month beyond the first creditcard statement whose statement is paid off in full in timely fashion. Finally, turning to the question asked, viz. \" I am trying to determine how much I need to pay monthly to zero the balance, ....\", as per the above calculations, if the OP makes the minimum required payment of 134.58 plus 1018.33, that 134.58 will be applied to the lowrate balance and the rest 1018.33 will pay off the highrate balance in full if the payment is made on the day the statement is issued. If payment is made later, but before the due date, that 1018.33 will be accruing finance charges until the date the payment is made, and these will appear as 22 rate balance on next months statement. Similarly for the lowrate balance. What if several monthly payments will be required? The best calculator known to me is at httpspowerpay.org free but it is necessary to set up a username and password. Enter in all the credit card balances and the different interest rates, and the total amount of money that can be used to pay off the balances, and the site will lay out a payment plan. Basically, pay off the highestinterest rate balance as much as possible while making minimum required payments on the rest. Most people are surprised at how much can be saved and how much shorter the time to be debtfree is if one is willing to pay just a little bit more each month."

The decision on what a company wants to do if an invoice total is 0.01 or 0.02 would be up to the company. The POS system should follow the rule and round to 0.00 if the method of payment is cash, but the company has the right to not give things away for free. They can impose a minimum cash invoice amount of 0.05. But you would do this by requiring the customer to add more items to their purchase. You couldnt just round the invoice up to 0.05 and to charge them 0.05 for a 0.01 item It would be similar to companies having a minimum purchase amount when paying by credit card. If their minimum amount is 10.00 and you want to buy something thats 5.00, you either pay cash or add something to your order. They dont just charge you 10.00 for your 5.00 item. I think this would be a extreme edge case where you have an invoice with a total of 0.01 or 0.02, without any discounts, partial payments, etc. If the customers total was 10.01 and they paid with a 10.00 gift card, the final amount owing of 0.01 would round down to 0.00 and they wouldnt owe any more. If they had paid cash, the total would have rounded to 10.00 anyway. Similarly, if the customer returned an item and bought a new item, or used coupons, and the total owing was 0.01 or 0.02, then you would round down to 0.00 and they wouldnt pay anything. As BobbyScon said, you can implement some options to allow the company to decide how they want to handle this. You could have an option that doesnt allow a sale to be processed if the total amount is less than 0.03 and the sale doesnt include any discounts, returned items, coupons, etc. The option could be to completely block the sale, require a supervisor override, or just display a warning to the cashier. Best bet is to talk to as many of your current or potential clients as you can to see how they would like this edge case handled. For many, its probably a mute case since they wouldnt have items that have a unit price less than 0.03. Maybe a place like a hardware store that sells individual nuts, bolts, and washers."

But If you earned a big bonus then the smaller regular paychecks may not have been withholding enough. When bonus checks are involved the payroll office has to treat them as irregular pay to be able to make it work out. Some companies dont do this, so you may under or over pay during the year. If you changed companies during the year, this can lead to under or over payment.

Company A has strong, growing, net earnings and minimal debt, its trading for 100 per share. Company B has good revenue but high costs of goods and total liabilities well in excess of total assets, its trading for 0.10 per share. There is no benefit to getting 10,000 shares or 10 shares for your 1,000. Your goal is to invest in companies that have valuable products and services run by competent management teams. Sure, the number of shares you own will dictate what percentage of the company you own, and in a number of cases, your voting power. But even a penny stock will have a market capitalization of several million dollars so voting power isnt really a concern for your 1,000 investment. There is a lot more in the three basic financial statements Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows than revenue. Seasoned accountants can have a hard time parsing out where money is coming from and where its going. In general there are obvious red flags, like a fast declining cash balance against a fast growing liabilities balance or expenses exceeding revenue. While some of these things are common among new and high growth companies, its not the place for a new investor with a small bankroll. A microcap company penny stocks are in this group will receive rounds of financing via issuing preferred convertible shares which may include options on more shares. For a company worth 20mm a 5mm financing round can materially change the finances of a company, and will likely dilute your holdings in common stock. Small growth companies need new financing frequently to fund their growth strategies. Revenue went up, great... why? Did you open another store? Did you open another sales office? Did the revenue increase this quarter based on substantially the same operation that existed last quarter or have you increased the capacity of your operation? If you increased the capacity of your operation what was the cost of the increase and did revenue increase as expected? Can you expect revenue to continue to grow at this rate or was it a one time windfall from an unusual order? Sure, there are spectacular gains to be had in penny stocks. XYZ Pharma Research or whatever goes from 0.05 to 0.60 and youve turned your 1,000 in to 12,000. This is a really unlikely event... Buying penny stocks is akin to buying lottery tickets. Unless you are a high ranking employee at the company capable of making decisions, or one of the investors buying the preferred shares mentioned in point 3, or are one of the insiders of a pump and dump scam on the stock, penny common stocks are not a place to invest. One could argue that even a company insider should probably avoid buying common stock. Just to illustrate the points above, you mention Doing some really heavy research into this stock has made me question the whole penny stock market. Based on your research what is the enterprise value of the company? What were the gross proceeds of the last financing round, how many shares were issued and were there any warrants attached? What do you perceive to be heavy research? What background do you have in financeaccounting to give weight to your ability to perform such research? Crawl. Walk. Then run. Dont kid yourself in to thinking that since you have some level of education you understand the contracts involved in enterprise finance."

    "content": "A stock, bond or ETF is basically a commodity. Where you bought it does not really matter, and it has a value in USD only inasmuch as there is a current market price quoted at an American exchange. But nothing prevents you from turning around and selling it on a European exchange where it is also listed for an equivalent amount of EUR arbitrage activities of investment banks ensure that the price will be equivalent in regard to the current exchange rate. In fact, this can be used as a cheap form of currency conversion. For blue chips at least this is trivial exotic securities might not be listed in Europe. All you need is a broker who allows you to trade on European exchanges and hold an account denominated in EUR. If necessary, transfer your securities to a broker who does, which should not cost more than a nominal fee. Mutual funds are a different beast though it might be possible to sell shares on an exchange anyway, or sell them back to the issuer for EUR. It depends. In any case, however, transferring 7 figure sums internationally can trigger all kinds of tax events and money laundering investigations. You really need to hire a financial advisor who has international investment experience for this kind of thing, not ask a web forum!"

    "topic": "How to rebalance a portfolio without moving money into losing investments",
    "content": "You are very correct, rebalancing is basically selling off winners to buy losers. Of course the thinking is that selling a winner that has already increased 100 on the basis that it has doubled so it is likely to go down in the near future. However, just look at Apple as an example, if you bought Apple in June 2009 for 20 adjusted price and sold it as part of rebalancing when it rose to 40 adjusted price in September 2010, you would have missed out on it reaching over 95 2 years later. Similarly you look to rebalance by buying assets which have been battered say dropped by 50 on the basis that it has dropped so much that it should start increasing in the near future. But many times the price can fall even further. A better method would be to sell your winners when they stop being winners i.e. their uptrend ends and replace them with assets that are just starting their winning ways i.e. their downtrend has ended and are now starting to Uptrend. This can be achieved by looking at price action and referring to the definitions of an uptrend and a downtrend. Definition of an uptrend  higher highs and higher lows. Definition of a downtrend  lower lows and lower highs."

    "topic": "Is Real Estate ever a BAD investment? If so, when?",
    "content": "No, it can really not. Look at Detroit, which has lost a million residents over the past few decades. There is plenty of real estate which will not go for anything like it was sold. Other markets are very risky, like Florida, where speculators drive too much of the price for it to be stable. You have to be sure to buy on the downturn. A lot of price drops in real estate are masked because sellers just dont sell, so you dont really know how low the price is if you absolutely had to sell. In general, in most of America, anyway, you can expect Real Estate to keep up with inflation, but not do much better than that. It is the rental income or the leverage if you buy with a mortgage that makes most of the returns. In urban markets that are getting an influx of people and industry, however, Real Estate can indeed outpace inflation, but the number of markets that do this are rare. Also, if you look at it strictly as an investment as opposed to the question of \"Is it worth it to own my own home?\" there are a lot of additional costs that you have to recoup, from property taxes to bills, rental headaches etc. Its an investment like any other, and should be approached with the same due diligence."

    "topic": "Technical Analysis not working",
    "content": "You cannot just read one book and some articles on Technical Analysis and some indicators and expect to be an expert and everything to just start falling into place and give you signals that will tell you when to buy and sell with precision and massive profits all the time. It is like someone reading a book on how to drive a car and then expecting to drive flawlessly the first time they sit in the drivers seat, or someone reading a book on brain surgery and expecting to be able to operate on a live patient the next day. It looks like you are using 3 or 4 indicators to get daily buy and sell signals on a daily chart for an EFT youre looking to hold for decades. So firstly you are using short term indicators for a long term outlook. You need to decide what timeframe you plan to hold your investments for and use chart periods and indicators that suit that timeframe. Secondly, each indicator can be used in a number of ways and the settings you use for each indicator can determine whether you get earlier or later signals. Also, you need to work out which indicators work well together and are complementary, compared to those that dont work well together and give conflicting signals. All this information will come together for you the more you read about and practice the art of Technical Analysis. If your timeframe is very longterm decades I would be using mainly a weekly chart, with a longer period MA, the ROC indicator and possibly some trend lines. Keep it simple. The price itself is very important too. You can determine when a trend is starting or has ended purely using the price. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows, so on the weekly chart if there is a lower high followed by a lower low  this could be the end of the uptrend. If we get a lower low followed by a lower high  this again could be the end of the uptrend. These could be a good time to start getting cautious and maybe looking to sell. If you are using stop losses which I recommend this may be a good time to tighten your stops. Similarly, a downtrend is defined as lower lows and lower highs. If we get a higher low followed by a higher high it could be the end of the downtrend and maybe the start of an uptrend. This could be a good time to start getting ready to buy. You need to learn about how and where to set your buy and sell orders including stops and whether you wait for confirmation when you get a signal. All this takes some time, but the more you read, the more you attend live events and the more you practice the more they will become second nature. In order to get the best out of Technical Analysis you will need to learn, plan, practice and execute. A good book to help you prepare your trading plan is \"Smart Trading Plans\" by Justine Pollard. One of my favourite books is \"The Complete Trading Course  Price Patterns, Strategies, Setups, and Execution Tactics\" by Corey Rosenbloom. And another good book is \"Trade your Way to Financial Freedom\" by Van Tharp."

    "content": "Its definitely annoying, but its not necessarily false advertising. There is no rule or law that says they have to fix a pricing error at all, let alone within a certain period of time. Unfortunately they have no obligation to do business with you unless they take and keep your money. If they canceled the order and returned your money you have no binding agreement with them. On top of that, in the US... misleading advertising usually refers to \"Any advertising or promotion that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities\" Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1125a. The main criteria that they evaluate before taking legal action is whether or not someone has suffered harm or loss due to the reliance on the bad information. But youre in Europe. The EU ideas behind misleading advertising tend to focus a lot more on comparing one product to someone elses and making subjective claims or false promises. Pricing does come up, but still, you need to have an ability to prove that you suffered harm or a loss from the business actions. Even if you were able to prove that, to force the business to change its price catalog, you would need to go through legal proceedings, demonstrate the harm that youve sustained, and then have a judge decide in your favor and order the supplier to comply. My guess is that its just not worth it for you, but you havent specified if this is just an annoying shoeshopping experience or if you are regularly experiencing baitandswitch tactics from a supplier that is a crucial part of a business operation. If its the former, just like a physical shop reserves the right to kick you out if youre not behaving, but usually doesnt because theyd like to keep you as a customer, an online shop can update its prices whenever they like. They can change their prices too, and cancel orders. If its the latter, then start putting together some documentation on how many times this has happened and how it has damaged your business. But before you get on the warpath I would recommend you look for another place to buy whatever you have in mind, or else try a pound of sugar in your approach to this supplier... My own business experience has shown that can go a lot way in figuring out a mutually beneficial resolution. If you want to see a bit more... Here is the EU Justice Commissions website on false advertising, Here is a PDF leaflet from the UK Office of Fair Trading that spells out what is explicitly not allowed from a business by way of advertising  business practices."

    "content": "You might be confusing two different things. An advantage of investing over a long term is the compounding of returns. Those returns can be interest, dividends, or capital gains. The mix between them depends on what you invest it and how you invest in it. This advantage applies whether your investment is in a taxable brokerage account or in a taxadvantaged 401K or IRA. So, start investing early so that you have longer for this compounding of returns to happen. The second thing is the tax deferral you get from 401k or IRAs. If you invest in a ordinary taxable account, then you have to pay taxes on your interest and dividends for the year in which they occur. You also have to pay taxes on any capital gains which you realize during the year. These yearly tax payments are then money that you dont get the benefit of compounding on. With 401k and IRAs, you dont have to pay taxes during these intermediate years."

This is called \"false reporting.\" The problem is, the data clearinghouses are not stupid and eventually realize some holeinthewall \"car dealer\" with no cars on the lot yes, they do physical inspections as part of the credentialing process, just sometimes theyre a little slow about it is reporting trade lines worth millions of dollars per year. Its a major problem in the industry. But eventually that business loses its fraudulent reporting ability, those trade lines get revoked, and your account gets flagged for a fraud investigation. The repair agency has your money, and you still dont have good credit. Bad news if this all goes down while youre trying to close on a house. Youre better off trying to settle your debts usually for 50 or declaring bankruptcy altogether. The latter isnt so bad if youre in a stable home, because you wont be able to get an apartment for a while, credit cards or a good deal on auto financing. ED I just saw what one agency was charging, and can tell you declaring bankruptcy costs only a few hundred dollars more than the repair agency and is 100 guaranteed to get you predictable results as long as you name all your debts up front and arent getting reamed by student loans. And considering you cant stomach creditors well guess what, now youll have a lawyer to deal with them for you. Anything you accomplish through an agency will eventually be reversed because its fraudulent. But through bankruptcy, your credit will start improving within two years, the tradeoff being that you wont be able to get a mortgage at all or apartment easily during that time so find a place to hunker down for a few years before you declare."

Instead of asking whether you should get an adviser, you might want to examine what your end goal is. Are you looking to build long term growth of you capital? Are you asking about and adviser because you dont want to handle your money, or is it simply because \"thats what people do?\" I would imagine that the answer to 1. is yes and that the answer to 2. is that you want to handle your money, and you always considered this something best left to the advisers. I shall proceed on these hypothetical assumptions. In my humble opinion, I would do the following Skip the adviser and the fees that go with it. For a young professional like yourself, especially with an engineering background, you can certainly handle the education required to learn the mechanics of investing. Invest some time to learn the fundamentals of the market such as asset classes, basic terminology ect. You will benefit in several ways. For one, you will learn an invaluable skill and save tens of thousands in fees during your lifetime. Moreover, you will have complete control of your risk profile, allocation, and every penny that belongs to you. I really am not bashing advisers, but no one will care as much about your money as you will. And dont be fooled. The market is efficient. An adviser does not have any more edge in a market than anyone else. And from first hand experience, they rarely outperform benchmarks net of fees. I assume you have made it to this step because you want to manage your own money and financial future. Sounds scary, how should one proceed? Lets assume that 100,000 is \"in play\". And since you are learning the ropes, lets leave 50,000 in cash for now. This leaves 50,000 to start a portfolio. Id start by building a core position of all the major asset classes in ETF form. This means buying things like SPY or TLT. If youre comfortable, you can start selling monthly calls against these positions to reduce basis and earn some income. The point is, your only limitation at this point is taking time to learn the ropes. The technology is there, the free education is there, and liquidity and product mix is there. Next thing you know youre learning how gamma scalping works, or maybe youre more of a Buffett type. This is how I view finance in general, and truly hope you break through the initial barrier to controling your own finances."

Even though Ive had my account with this bank for decades and the name is obviously mine, just a pet or diminitive form of my first name e.g. Becky instead of Rebecca. This creates a lot of inconvenience to ask every customer to write the cheque to my full name, or make the cheque \"bearer\" or not to cross \"or bearer\" if it is printed on the cheque already. It is very sad that there is protection for individual privacy in Australia, unless you can afford to have a business address. But even in this case, your name, date of birth and other personal information will be pusblished in the business register and the access to this information will be sold to all sorts of dubious enterprises like credit report companies, debt collectors, market researchers, etc. It seems like Australian system is not interested in people being independent, safe, selfsufficient and working for themselves.

Many companies on the OTC are just starting off there because they dont meet the requirements to be listed on the NASDAQ or NYSE. Major stock exchanges like the NASDAQ and the NYSE only want the best companies to trade on their exchanges.The NASDAQ, for example, has three sets of listing requirements. A company must meet at least one of the three requirement sets, as well as the main rules for all companies. These include Now dont assume that the OTC doesnt have rules either, as this is far from the truth as well. While there are no minimum level of revenue, profits or assets required to get listed on the OTC there are requirements for audited financial statements and ongoing filing and reporting to the SEC and NASD. Additionally there are several different levels of the OTC, including the OTCQX, the OTCCB and the OTC Pink, each with their own set of requirements. For more information about what it takes to be listed on OTC look here httpwww.otcmarkets.comlearnotctrading A company deciding to trade on the OTC is making the decision to take their company public, and they are investing to make it happen. Currently the fees to get listed on the OTC range from 30,000 to 150,000 depending on the firm you decide to go with and the services they offer as part as their package. Now, I know I wouldnt consider 30K or more to not be serious money! When I looked into the process of getting a company listed on the TSX the requirements seemed a lot more relaxed than those of the major U.S. markets as well, consisting of an application, records submission and then a decision made by a TSX committee about whether you get listed. More information about the TSX here httpapps.tmx.comenlistingslistingwithusprocessindex.html I think the way that the OTC markets have gotten such a bad reputation is from these \"Get Rich on Penny Stock\" companies that you see pumping up OTC company stocks and getting massive amounts of people to buy without doing their due diligence and investigating the company and reading its prospectus. Then when they loose a bunch of money on an illinformed investment decision they blame it on the company being an OTC stock. Whether you decide to trade the OTC market or not, I wouldnt make a decision based on how many exchanges the company is listed on, but rather based on the research you do into the company."

The way it works is that every month, they send the credit agencies your current balance and if you paid the last bill on time. There is nothing that indicates if this is a standing balance, or if you charged all of it since the last payment. Any business that you legitimately owe a debt to can report that to the credit agencies. Not all of them do. This includes utilities, cell phone companies, landlords, etc. If any of them report overdue items it will show up on your credit report, and your credit card company can use that to raise you interest rate. Some cards will automatically raise you credit limit. They are basically looking to make money fro you. If you often charge near the limit, and pay the minimum balance each month, they may raise your limit to get you to charge more, and pay more interest. You can also call them and ask. They have some internal rules to decide if, based on your history with them and your credit history, if you are a good risk."

The Coinage Act of 1873 dropped silver and made gold the legal standard for currency. In 1933, the \"redeemable in gold\" was changed by federal statute and the legend you mention was added.

    "content": "The examples you provide in the question are completely irrelevant. It doesnt matter where the brokerage is or where is the company you own stocks in. For a fairly standard case of an nonresident alien international student living full time in the US  your capital gains are US sourced. Let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally has its source in the United States if the alien has a tax home in the United States. The key factor in determining if an individual is a U.S. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether the aliens \"tax home\" has shifted to the United States. If an alien does not have a tax home in the United States, then the aliens U.S. source capital gains would be treated as foreignsource and thus nontaxable. In general, under the \"tax home\" rules, a person who is away or who intends to be away from his tax home for longer than 1 year has shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new location. See Chapter 1 of Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses Ill assume youve read this and just want an explanation on what it means. What it means is that if you move to the US for a significant period of time expected length of 1 year or more, your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the US and the capital gains are sourced to the US from the start of your move. For example you are a foreign diplomat, and your 4year assignment started in May. Yearend  youre not US tax resident diplomats exempt, but youve stayed in the US for more than 183 days, and since your assignment is longer than 1 year  your tax home is now in the US. Youll pay the 30 flat tax. Another example Youre a foreign airline pilot, coming to the US every other day flying the airline aircraft. You end up staying in the US 184 days, but your tax home hasnt shifted, nor youre a US tax resident  you dont pay the flat tax. Keep in mind, that tax treaties may alter the situation since in many cases they also cover the capital gains situation for nonresidents."

To avoid liability issues, you could setup a S corporation. Basically, the business is considered its own entity and legal matters can only take as much as the business owns. You gain more protection but if you dont explicitly keep your business finances separate from your personal finances, you can get into a lot of trouble. Also, corporations generally pay out more in taxes. Technically, since the business is its own entity youll need to pay yourself a reasonable salary. If you skip the salary and pay yourself the profits directly ie evade being taxed on incomesalary the IRS will shut you down thats one of the leading causes of corporations being shut down. You can also pay distribute bonuses on top of that but it would be wise to burn the words within reason into your memory first. The tax man gets mad if you short him on payroll taxes. S corporations are complicated, if you go that route definitely seek help from an accountant. Bookkeeping If youre not willing to pay a full time accountant youll need to do a lot of studying about how this works. Generally, even if you have a sole proprietorship its best to have a separate bank account for all of your business transactions. Every sourcedrain of money will fall into one of 3 categories... Assets  What your business owns Assets can be categorized by liquidity. Meaning how fast you can transform them directly into cash. Just because a company is worth a lot doesnt necessarily mean it has a lot of cash. Some assets depreciate lose value over time whereas some are very hard to transform back into cash based on the value andor market fluctuations like property. Liabilities  What you owe others and what others owe you Everything you owe and everything that is owed to you gets tracked. Just like credit cards, its completely possible to owe more than you own as long as you can pay the interest to maintain the loans. Equity  the net worth of the company The approach they commonly teach in schools is called doubleentry bookkeeping where they use the equation In practice I prefer the following because it makes more sense Basically, if you account for everything correctly both sides of the equation should match up. If you choose to go the sole proprietorship route, its smart to track everything Ive mentioned above but you can choose to keep things simple by just looking at your Equity. Equity, the heart of your business... Basically, every transaction you make having to do with your business can be simplified down to debits moneyvalue increasing and credits moneyvalue decreasing. For a very simple company you can assess this by looking at net profits. Which can be calculated with Revenues, are made up of money earned by services performed and goods sold. Expenses are made up of operating costs, materials, payroll, consumables, interest on liabilities, etc. Basically, if you brought in 250K but it cost you 100K to make that happen, youve made 150K for the year in profit. So, for your taxes you can count up all the money youve made Revenues, subtract all of the money youve paid out Expenses and youll know how much profit youve made. The profit is what you pay taxes on. The kicker is, there are gray areas when it comes to deducting expenses. For instance, you can deduct the expense of using your car for business but you need to keep a log and can only expense the miles you traveled explicitly for business. Same goes for deducting dedicated workspaces in your house. Basically, do the research if youre not 100 sure about a deduction. If you dont keep detailed books and try to expense stuff without proof, you can get in trouble if the IRS comes knocking. There are always mythical stories about that one guy who wrote off his boat on his taxes but in reality, you can go to jail for tax fraud if you do that. It comes down to this. At the end of the year, if your business took in a ton of money youll owe a lot in taxes. The better you can justify your expenses, the more you can reduce that debt. One last thing. Youll also have to pay your personal federalstate taxes including selfemployment tax. That means medicaresocial security, etc. If this is your first foray into selfemployment youre probably not familiar with the fact that 1099 employers pick up 12 of the 15 medicaresocial security bill. Typically, if you have an idea of what you make annually, you should be paying this out throughout the year. My pay as a contractor was always erratic so I usually paid it out oncetwice a year. Its better to pay too much than too little because the govt will give you back the money you overpaid. At the end of the day, paying taxed sucks more if youre selfemployed but it balances out because you can make a lot more money. If as you said, youve broken six figures, hire a damn accountantadviser to help you out and start reading. When people say, \"a business degree will help you advance in any field,\" its subjects like accounting are core requirements to become a business undergrad. If you dont have time for more school and dont want to pay somebody else to take care of it, theres plenty of written material to learn it on your own. Its not rocket surgery, just basic arithmetic and a lot of business jargon ie almost as much as technology."

To evaluate whether or not to sell, the amount you have spent on the house is irrelevant. The only thing you need to ask yourself is this Would I spend 280k to buy this house today? You might, if you were happy with the rental income that you were getting. If the house is fully rented, it earns you 24kyear, which is an 8.6 return if you had purchased the house today at 280k. Of course, you will have vacancies, taxes, and other expenses bringing that return number down. Figure out what that is, and see if you are happy with the return based on those numbers. If you decide it would be a bad investment for you at 280k, then sell the house. By the way, this question works for any investment, not just real estate.

The deposit protection scheme  httpswww.depositprotection.com  is one way that deposits are securely held in this manner. As a third party they will have different account details. It may be the case that the agency is protecting the deposit and you are paying rent to the landlord directly. This means that your deposit goes to the agencys account and the rent goes to the landlords account. Obviously your landlord and agency have different accounts. A little colour to brighten your day I am currently paying my rent to the agency who also took the deposit but, because of the way they handle deposits versus rent, the deposit was sent to a different account held by the same agent. In my previous flat I paid the deposit to an agency and the rent directly to the landlord. This resulted in an issue one time where I got the two accounts confused and paid rent to the agency who, after giving me a small slap on the wrist, transferred it to my landlord. In the flat before that I paid rent and the deposit to my landlords holding company. That is one of the few times that I paid rent and the deposit into the same account. Again check with the agent that one of these situations is the case but this is absolutely normal when renting through an agency."

Such transactions incur costs that are paid proportionally by all the shareholders in the fund, not just the person requesting redemption, and thus the remaining shareholders get a lower return. Exchangetraded funds are traded as if they are shares of common stock, and a shareholder seeking a redemption pays the costs of the redemption. For this reason, many mutual funds do not allow redemptions for some period of time after a purchase, or purchases for some period of time after a redemption.

Good question I cant even get US banks to answer questions like this, such as \"What happens if they try to nationalize all bank accounts like in the Soviet Union?\" Response itll never happen. The question was what if! I think that your portfolio carries a lot of risk, but also offsets what youre worried about. Outside of government confiscation of foreign accounts if your foreign investments are held through a local brokerage, you should be good. What to do about government confiscation? Even the US government in 1933 confiscated physical gold and they made it illegal to own  so even physical resources can be confiscated during hard times. Quite a large portion of my foreign investments have been bought at an expensive time when our currency is already around historic lows, which does concern me in the event that it strengthens in future. What strategy should I take in the future ifwhen my local currency starts the strengthen...do I hold my foreign investments through it and just trust in cost averaging long term, or try sell them off to avoid the devaluation? Are these foreign investments a hedge? If so, then you shouldnt worry if your currency does strengthen they serve the purpose of hedging the local environment. If these investments are not a hedge, then timing will matter and youll want to sell and buy your currency before it does strengthen. The risk on this latter point is that your timing will be wrong."

    "topic": "Why does selling and then rebuying stock not lead to free money?",
    "content": "I think the simple answer to your question is Yes, when you sell, that drives down the price. But its not like you sell, and THEN the price goes down. The price goes down when you sell. You get the lower price. Others have discussed the mechanics of this, but I think the relevant point for your question is that when you offer shares for sale, buyers now have more choices of where to buy from. If without you, there were 10 people willing to sell for 100 and 10 people willing to buy for 100, then there will be 10 sales at 100. But if you now offer to sell, there are 11 people selling for 100 and 10 people buying for 100. The buyers have a choice, and for a seller to get them to pick him, he has to drop his price a little. In real life, the market is stable when one of those sellers drops his price enough that an 11th buyer decides that he now wants to buy at the lower price, or until one of the other 10 buyers decides that the price has gone too low and hes no longer interested in selling. If the next day you bought the stock back, you are now returning the market to where it was before you sold. Assuming that everything else in the market was unchanged, you would have to pay the same price to buy the stock back that you got when you sold it. Your net profit would be zero. Actually youd have a loss because youd have to pay the brokers commission on both transactions. Of course in real life the chances that everything else in the market is unchanged are very small. So if youre a typical smallfry kind of person like me, someone who might be buying and selling a few hundred or a few thousand dollars worth of a company that is worth hundreds of millions, other factors in the market will totally swamp the effect of your little transaction. So when you went to buy back the next day, you might find that the price had gone down, you can buy your shares back for less than you sold them, and pocket the difference. Or the price might have gone up and you take a loss."

Selling the building might require enough repairs that the building is habitable if the repair costs are too high, you might not be able to recover costs from selling. For a particularly old and unkempt building, this is more likely to be the case. In extreme scenarios, you may earn more net profit by demolishing a decrepit building, and simply selling the land. Make sure you arent setting your price too high if you are desperate to sell dropping your price might make the headache of upkeep go away, and might be better for you financially in the long run. 2 You could rent it  but if it is so uninhabitable you cant sell it, then this is unlikely without repairs and it seems you dont want to do this anyway. 3 If your building is in an area where the zoning laws are not strict, you may be able to apply for a permit to have it zoned for commercial use  and either run a business out of it, or rent it to someone else to do so. Again, this would be dependent on repairs if the building is uninhabitable, and also would require the building to wellsituated for a business. 4 You could take out a mortgage on the building. Of course, this has two big caveats a the bank would need to assess the building for value [and it seems not to be worth much in your case] and b this provides only temporary cash, which you would need to pay back to the bank over time. In some cases, if you had a solid plan, you might be able to take a mortgage out against the value of the land, and use the cash from the mortgage to do some repairs, so that it would be in good shape for selling."

You could live off of that for three years. If the market does crash, this should give you plenty of time to recover. Taking this option opens you to another risk, which is being beat up by inflation or lack of growth on a nice pile of cash. My time frame is not that different then yours I am about 12 years away, but am still all in stocks.

These guys have a lot of smart people running s for them. Be sure to read the specifics of the loan contract. There may be a penalty for paying it off early. Most customers wont be able to pay that much in cash, so the bank makes a deal with the dealership to send clients their way. They will lose money on a small percentage of clients, but make more off of the rest of the clients. If theres no penalty for paying it off early, you may just want to take the financing offer and pay it off ASAP. If you truly can only finance 2500 for 6 mos, and get the full discount, then that might work as well. The bank had to set a minimum for the dealership in order to qualify as a loan that earns the discount. Sounds like thats it. Bonus Info Heres a screenshot of Kelley Blue Book for that car.

Of course I cant guarantee that is universally the case, but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later, or tomorrow, or next week, its extremely likely that theyll still take your money for the original price. In fact, sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the \"excellent offer\"... Most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a \"this price is only good right now\" pitch, it ends up being because they dont want you to go search the competition and read reviews. In this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile. Perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price. Sales is an art, and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it. This particular salesperson obviously misjudged you andor you dont have an easily exploitable vulnerability. I wouldnt let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase. If you are worried about the scenario of someone else snatching up the item, consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you \"reflect\" andor \"arrange for the funds\"."

    "content": "Its pretty simple  the less money you owe the less interest you pay. Paying down debt gives a guaranteed return of the interest rate of the debt. So paying off your starter loan is equivalent to a 4 return. Thats not a bad return in the current environment so it makes sense to do it unless you can find an investment which you think is likely to pay significantly better. Note this is a general answer, not Netherlandsspecific. There may be other considerations, around tax for example, which have to be factored into the calculation."

My son is now 1 year and during a normal weekday, I go through 4 disposable diapers and 34 cloth diapers this count includes a double thick cloth diaper for night. On the weekend, I use about 78 cloth diapers a day. For disposable, I buy Costcos Kirkland brand diapers which gives me about 200 diapers for 50. I tend to go through one pack every other month. For cloth, I bought FuzziBunz OneSize Diapers. These are pretty expensive diapers about 19each but I wanted ones that would last over multiple children I chose these over the BumGenius because I thought snaps would last longer than velcro. I bought 24 new cloth diapers which means I wash diapers every 23 days. A couple of weeks ago I totaled up my receipts for cloth and disposable diapers and determined that I will recoup my diaper costs at around 16 months of parttime use. Notes"

In this case, you can be provided with a social security number and start to build your own credit history. II. Get credit card You can also consider to apply for a credit card. There are indeed some financial institutions that can provide credit cards for international students with no or limited credit scores requirement, say Discover and Bank of America. However, it is relatively hard to get approved, simply because hey may put more restriction in other aspects. For example, you may be required to keep sufficient bank balance above several thousand dollars during a period of time, or you should prove that you have relatives with citizenship in US who can provide your financial aid if needed. III. Apply for a loan recommended Getting a loan product is another alternative to get out of this difficult situation, but most of people dont realize that. There are some FinTech startups in United States that specifically focus on international students loan financing. One representative example is Westbon Westbon , an online lending company that specializes in providing car loan for international students with no SSN or credit history. I once used their loan product to finance a Honda Accord, and Westbon reported my loan transaction records to US credit bureau during my repayment process. Later when I officially got my SSN number, I found my credit history has been automatically synchronized and I dont have to start from all over again. It never be an easy journey for international students to build credit history in United States. What approach you should make really depends on you own situation. I hope the information above can be useful and good luck for your credit journey!"

    "content": "I am not a Financial Advisor, but I an tell you what I did in exactly this situation  which is pretty much what you are proposing. I put money into the offset savings account until I had only a small amount of mortgage \"balance\" left less than a years worth of mortgage payments, then I set it up so that each month I did the transfer from the offset savings pot into the mortgage itself. This depleted the offset savings in line with the mortgage debt, and the interest on the two balanced out almost to zero. This was selfsustaining and meant that I kept the same margin owing over time i.e. if I was in this situation for 5 years, for the whole 5 years I would effectively have 1 year remaining on the mortgage. Meanwhile, since I now didnt have any mortgage outgoings from my regular income, I put any spare money into ISA savings. No need to withdraw money from the mortgage to move to the ISA. The benefits of this as opposed to just paying off the damn mortgage already were that I kept the full liquidity of the mortgage amount  I could withdraw all the offset savings pot if I wanted to, although I would then have to have funded the mortgage payments differently, and as that liquidity went down over time I was building up other savings in parallel. It worked well for me. It almost doesnt matter what the offset mortgage rate is since you are effectively paying it off by keeping the offset savings pot so high."

    "content": "Re Specifically, am I right in that everything I put on these is deducted from tax, or are there other rules? and Am I correctly understanding this as \"anything above 3,600 per year will not be deducted from your tax\"? Neither interpretation seems quite right Unless what you mean is this The contributions to a pension, or to the sharesave scheme are deducted from your pay before it is taxed. Thats how it works for employerrun pension schemes. In other words, you are paying the gross amount you earn into the pension, not the amount after tax. Its a taxefficient way to save, because compared to other forms of saving The bit about the 3,600 you can ignore this assuming youre earning more than 3,600 a year. What happens to the pension if you decide to move back to France or another country? In some cases you can transfer tax free. Worst case, youd pay some tax on the transfer but not more than 25. [See here for the current rules httpswww.gov.uktransferringyourpensiontransferringtoanoverseaspensionscheme. Re the share scheme, if by salary exchange you mean salary sacrifice where your gross pay is officially reduced by that amount e.g. 150 a month, thats even more taxefficient, because it saves you paying the National Insurance contribution too approx 9 of the pay packet. Conclusion Saving into pension and company share save schemes is supremely taxefficient and, provided youre OK with your money being locked away until youre 57 pension or tied up in company shares, its understandably many peoples priority to make use of these schemes before considering other forms of saving where you pay into them from your salary after tax. Now, about this I am trying to understand how much I should put into it Should I put money into these, or should look for another way to save how will this work out if I go back to France or another country? Nobody here can advise you what to do since individuals goals and circumstances are different and we dont know enough of the picture. That said FWIW, Ill tell you what I might do based solely on what youve told us in the question First, Id definitely contribute 6 to the company pension. This gets you the full employer match. Thats free money plus, remember the tax relief  more free money. If youre 27, a total of 12 salary into a pension a year is a decent rate to start saving for retirement. Actually, 14 would be generally advisable, and maybe more still  its generally a case of the more the better especially while young, as you have time for growth and you dont know what later priorities might change  financial needs might arise.

You can make the situation improve a bit faster by lending money to yourself and having it reported regularly on your report. How? Easy. Get a secured credit card. What does it mean?

    "topic": "How do I evaluate a health insurance policy that covers a specific disease?",
    "content": "These policies are usually called dread disease policies or critical illness insurance, and they normally arent a good deal. Furthermore, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, such policies may become less common or disappear entirely. These policies arent a great deal because of the effects of adverse selection and asymmetric information, two closely related concepts in the economics of insurance. When you purchase an insurance policy, the insurance company charges you a premium based on your average risk level or the average risk level of your risk pool, e.g. you and your fellow employees, if you get insurance through your employer. For health insurance, this average risk level is the average probability that youll incur healthcare costs. The insurers actuaries calculate this probability from numerous factors, like your age, sex, current health, socioeconomic status, etc. Asymmetric information exists when you know more about this probability than the insurance company does. For example, you may look like a relatively lowrisk individual on paper, but little does the insurance company know, BASE jumping is one of your hobbies. Because you know about your hobby and the insurance company doesnt, you secretly know that your risk of incurring healthcare expenses is much higher than the insurance company expects. If the insurance company knew this, they would like to charge you a much higher premium, if they could. However, they cant, because a they dont know about your hobby, and b the premium may be decided for the entire grouprisk pool, so they cant increase it simply because a few individuals in the group have higher risk levels. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance. You may decide that because of your dangerous hobby, you do want to take advantage of your employers healthcare plan. Unfortunately for the insurance company, they cant adjust their price accordingly. Adverse selection is a major factor in insurance markets, so I didnt go into much detail here too much detail is probably offtopic anyway. I can point you towards more resources on the topic if youre interested. However, the situation is different when you purchase a dread disease policy. By expressing interest in such a specific policy, e.g. a cancer insurance policy, you signal to the insurance company that you feel you have a higher risk of facing that disease. In your case, youre signaling to the insurance company that your family probably has a history of cancer or that you have habits that make you more susceptible to it, and your premiums will be higher to compensate the insurance company for bearing this additional risk. Since the insurance company already has a rough estimate of your chances of developing that illness, they may already know that you have a higher chance of facing it. However, when you express interest in a diseasespecific policy, this signals the existence of asymmetric information your family history or other habits, and the insurer assumes you know something they dont that elevates your risk level of that specific disease. Since these policies are optional policies often sold as riders to existing policies, the insurance company has more flexibility in pricing them. They can charge you a higher premium because youve signaled to the insurer that you have a significantly aboveaverage risk of contracting a specific disease. Also, the insurer can do a much better job of estimating the expected costs of insuring you since they need only focus on data surrounding one disease. The policy will be priced accordingly, i.e. in such a way that isnt necessarily beneficial to you. Furthermore, most dread disease policies arent guaranteed renewable, which means that even if you are willing to keep paying the premiums, the insurance company doesnt have to keep insuring you. As your risk of developing the specific disease grows, e.g. with age, it may pass the point where insuring you is no longer an acceptable risk. The company expects you to develop the illness with the next few renewal cycles, so they decide not to renew your policy. The end result? The insurance company has the premiums youve paid previously, but you no longer have coverage for that illness, and ex post, youve suffered a net loss with no reduction of risk for the foreseeable future. Dread disease policies are changing under the Affordable Care Act. According to healthcare.gov Starting in 2014, ... all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small businesses, and plans purchased in the new Affordable Insurance Exchanges, must include a range of essential health benefits. The essential health benefits include quite a few areas of coverage since this applies to policies offered on the state insurance exchanges and those offered outside of it, dread disease policies wouldnt seem to qualify. For more information, you can read the linked page on healthcare.gov or see Section 1302, subsection b, titled \"Essential Health Benefits Requirements\" in the law itself p87. I imagine more details will be available on a statebystate basis through 2014 and into 2015. One legal source see the discussion on p24 states that whatever else the ACA does with excepted benefit policies, including specific disease and fixed dollar indemnity policies, it does explicitly provide that such policies do not count as minimum essential coverage for purposes of the ACA This seems pretty straightforward a dread disease or \"specific disease\" policy, as its referred to in the article, wont count towards the minimum essential requirements. This may not be an issue for you, but for others, its important to understand that youll still need to pay the penalty if you only purchase one of these policies. The ACA spells this out in Section 5000f see p316, which states that \"excepted benefit policies\" are excluded and defines them using the definition in the Public Health Service Act PHSA. The PSHA specifically includes \"Coverage only for a specified disease or illness\" in their definition of \"excepted benefit policies\" see section 2791b, paragraph 3A on p82, so its probably a safe bet that such policies wont count towards the minimum. Also, as Rick pointed out in the comments, the Affordable Care Act also forbids lifetime limits on most insurance plans, so assuming you find an insurance policy with adequate coverage for the specific disease youre worried about, such a plan should cover the related expenses without a lifetime limit. Deductibles, annual limits, and other factors may complicate this somewhat. In the section about lifetime limits Sec. 2711, p2, the Affordable Care Act states that A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish ... lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary. However, the law states in the next paragraph that the preceding statement should not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section 1302b of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law The section also contains similarly vague caveats about annual limits, so the actual details and limits may vary once individual states finalize their policies. The law is intentionally vague because the vast majority of the laws implementation is left up to individual states. Furthermore, certain parts of the law specify actions involving the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so these may require further codification in the future too. You should still read the fine print of any insurance policy you buy and evaluate it as you would any contract see the next section. Since a dread disease policy probably isnt a good idea, youll probably want to evaluate the healthcare plans offered by your employer or individual plans offered in your area if your employer doesnt offer coverage. Ive tried to include the basic points offered in these articles to give you or future visitors some idea of where to start. These points may change once the Affordable Care Act is implemented, so Ill try to keep them as general as possible. Services  Above and beyond the minimum essential requirements, what services does the plan offer? Are these services a good match for you andor your family, or do they add unnecessary cost to the premium with little or no benefit? For example, my health insurance plan offers basic dental coverage with a small copay, so I dont need a separate dental plan, even though my employer offers one. Choice  What doctors, clinics, hospitals, etc. are preferred providers under your plan? Do you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist, or can you find one on your own? Are the preferred providers convenient for you? In my first year of college about five years ago, my student health insurance only covered a few hospitals that were in the suburbs and somewhat difficult for me to reach. This is something to keep in mind, depending on where you live. Costs  This is a major one, obviously. Deductibles, copays, maximum cost limits over a year or your lifetime, outofnetwork costs, etc. are all variables to consider. There are other factors, but since I dont have a family, other members of the site can provide more detailed information about what to look for in family policies. In place of a dread disease policy, youre likely better off purchasing a comprehensive health insurance policy, perhaps a catastrophic coverage policy with a high deductible that will kick in once youve exhausted your standard insurance policy. However, this may be a moot point since the passage of the Affordable Care Act may significantly reduce the availability of such policies anyway."

    "content": "A companys valuation includes its assets, in addition to projected earnings. Aside from the obvious issue that \"projected earnings\" can be wildly inaccurate or speculative as in the case of startups and fastmoving industries like technology, a companys assets are not necessarily tied to the market the company is in. For the sake of illustration, say the government were to ban fast food tomorrow, and the market for that were to go all the way to zero. McDonalds would still have almost 30 billion dollars worth of real estate holdings that would surely make the company worth something, even though it would have to stop selling its products. Similarly, Apple is sitting on approximately 200 billion dollars in cash and securities in overseas subsidiaries. Even if they never make another cent selling iPhones and such, the company is still worth a lot because of those holdings. \"Corporate raiders\" back in the 70s and 80s made massive personal fortunes exploiting this disconnect in undervalued companies that had more assets than their market cap, by getting enough ownership to liquidate the companys assets. Oliver Stone even made a movie about the phenomenon. So yes, its certainly possible for a company to be worth more than the size of the market for its products."

If you originally traded something worth 100 for the bitcoins, then when you converted back to dollars you received 200, you would have a 100 gain, simply on the foreign exchange trade. That is, this 100 of income is in addition to any income you made from your business selling goods."

Even though the majority of transactions are electronic creditdebit or check, the local grocery store still seems to have significant cash on hand. This is seen as a customer service. If there is a 2 fee the 50 advance costs them 1 for the minority of customers that take advantage of it. After more than 10 years of doing this they have figured this into the cost of groceries. Of course the credit card company could also waive the fee to store. My credit card online statement does tell me how much cash back was received. The line says date, store, amount 40.00 cash over and 123.45 purchases 163.45 total. Therefore the credit card company knows that cash back was used."

The attorney general may find a bond unacceptable based only upon reasonable criteria relating to the sufficiency of the bond, and shall notify the landlord in writing of his reasons for the unacceptability of the bond. 2 The bond shall be for the benefit of persons making security deposits with the landlord. A person for whose benefit the bond is written or his legal representative may bring an action in the district, common pleas or municipal court where the landlord resides or does business for collection on the bond.

    "content": "Technically, anyone who advises how you should spend or proportion your money is a financial adviser. A person that does it for money is a Financial Advisor difference in spelling. Financial Advisors are people that basically build, manage, or advise on your portfolio. They have a little more institutional knowledge on howwhere to invest, given your goals, since they do it on a daily basis. They may know a little more than you since, they deal with many different assets stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds, insurances homehealthlife, REITs, options, futures, LEAPS, etc. There is risk in everything you do, which is why what they propose is generally according to the risklevel you want to assume. Since youre younger, your risk level could be a little higher, as you approach retirement, your risk level will be lower. Risk level should be associated with how likely youre able to reacquire your assets if you lose it all as well as, your likelihood to enjoy the fruits from your investments. Financial Advisors are great, however, be careful about them. Some are payed on commissions, which are given money for investing in packages that they support. Basically, they could get paid  for putting you in a losing situation. Also be careful because some announce that they are feebased  these advisers often receive fees as well as commissions. Basically, associate the term \"commission\" with \"conflictofinterest\", so you want a feeonly Advisor, which isnt persuaded to steer you wrong. Another thing worth noting is that some trading companies like etrade has financial services that may be free, depending how much money you have with them. Generally, 50K is on the lower end to get a Financial Advisors. There has been corruption in the past, where Financial Advisors are only given a limited number of accounts to manage, that means they took the lowervalued ones and basically ran them into the ground, so they could get newer ones from the lot that were hopefully worth more  the larger their portfolio, the more  they could make higher fees or more commissions and subjectively less work less accounts to have to deal with, thats subjective, since the spread of the wealth was accross many markets."

I look beyond credit score as a landlord, a tenant with poor credit but a stellar rental history is more appealing than someone with great credit but a bad rental history. Vehicles and housing are very important to people, so they are likely to prioritize them above credit card payments or hospital bills.

    "topic": "Relationship between liquidity and an efficient market",
    "content": "Liquidity is highly correlated to efficiency primarily because if an assets price is not sampled during the time of a trade, its price is unknown therefore inefficient. Past prices can be referenced, but they are not the price of the present. Prices of substitutes are even worse. SPY is extremely efficient for an equity. If permitted, it could easily trade with much lower ticks and still have potential for a locked market. Ideal exchange An ideal exchange has no public restrictions on trade. This is not to say that private restrictions would need to be put in place for various reasons, but one would only do that if it were responsible for its own survival instead of being too big to fail. In this market, trades would be approximately continuous for the largest securities and almost always locked because of continuous exchange fee competition with ever dropping minimum ticks. A market that can provide continuous locked orders with infinite precision is perfectly efficient from the point of view of the investor because the value of ones holdings are always known. EMH In terms of the theory the Efficient Market Hypothesis this is irrelevant to the rational investor. The rational investor will invest in the market at large of a given asset class, only increasing risk as wealth increases thus moving to more volatile asset classes when the volatility can be absorbed by excess wealth. Here, liquidity is also helpful, the \"two heads are better than one\" way of thinking. The more invested in an asset class, the lower the classs variance and vice versa. Bonds, the least variant, dwarf equities which dwarf options, all in order of the least variance. Believe it or not, there was a day when bonds were almost as risky as equities. For those concerned with EMH, liquidity is also believed to increase efficiency in some forms because liquidity is proportional to the number of individuals invested thus reducing the likelihood of an insufficient number of participants. External inefficiency In the case of ETFs that do not perfectly track their underlying index less costs at all times between index changes, this is because they are forbidden from directly trading in the market on their own behalf. If they were allowed and honest, the price would always be perfect and much more liquid than it otherwise should be since the combined frequency of all index members is much higher than any one alone. If one was dishonest, it would try to defraud with higher or lower numbers however, if insider trading were permitted, both would fail due to the prisoners dilemma that there is no honor among thieves. Here, the market would detect the problem much sooner because the insiders would arbitrage the false price away. Indirect internal efficiency Taking emerging market ETFs as an example, the markets that those are invested into are heavily restricted, so their ETF to underlying price inefficiencies are more pronounced even though the ETFs are actually working to make those underlying markets more efficient because a price for them altogether is known."

    "topic": "What are the differences between a REIT and an MLP?",
    "content": "A REIT is a real estate investment trust. It is a company that derives most of its gross income from and holds most of its assets in real estate investments, which, in this case, include either real property, mortgages, or both. They provide a way for investors to get broad exposure in a real estate market without going to buy a bunch of properties themselves. It also provides diversification within the real estate segment since REITs will often but not necessarily have either way more properties than an individual could get or have very large properties like a few resorts that would be too expensive for any one investor. By law, they must pay at least 90 of their taxable income as dividends to investors, so they typically have a good dividend rate possibly but not necessarily at the expense of growth of the stock price. Some of those dividends may be tax advantaged and some will not. An MLP is a master limited partnership. These trade on the exchange like corporations, but they are not corporations. Although often used in common language as synonyms, corporation and company are not the same thing. Corporation is one way to organize a company under the law. They are partnerships, and when you buy a share you become a partner in the company. This is an alternative form of ownership to being a shareholding. In this case you are a limited partner, which means that you have limited liability as with stock. The shares may appreciate or not, just like a stock, and you can generally sell them back to the market for a capital gain or loss under the same rules as a stock. The main difference here from a practical point of view is taxes Partnerships of any type do no pay tax  Instead their income and costs are passed to the individual partners, who must then include it on their personal returns Form 1040, Schedule E. The partnership will send each shareholder a Schedule K1 form at tax time. This means you may have \"phantom income\" that is taxable even though cash never flowed through your hands since youll have to account for the income of the partnership. Many partnerships mitigate this by making cash distributions during the year so that the partners do actually see the cash, but this is not required. On the other hand, if it does happen, its often characterized as a return of capital, which is not taxable in the year that you receive it. A return of capital reduces your cost basis in the partnership and will eventually result in a larger capital gain when you sell your shares. As with any investment, there are pros and cons to each investment type. Of the two, the MLP is probably less like a \"regular\" stock since getting the Schedule K1 may require some extra work at tax time, especially if youve never seen one before. On the other hand, that may be worth it to you if you can find one thats appreciating in value and still returning capital at a good rate since this could be a \"best of everything\" situation where you defer tax and  when you eventually do pay, you pay at favorable capital gains rates  but still manage to get your cash back in hand before you sell. In case not clear, my comments about tax are specific to the US. No idea how this is treated elsewhere. By real world example, I guess you meant a few tickers in each category? You can find whole lists online. I just did a quick search \"list of MLP\" and \"list of REIT\", found a list, and have provided the top few off of the first list that I found. The lists were alphabetical by company name, so theres no explicit or implicit endorsement of these particular investments. Examples of REIT Examples of MLP"

You would be responsible for issuing 1099 forms to anyone who goes above 600 for the year source.

You need to give this number to the school so that they can issue the correct form to you. You might have to register a \"Doing Business As\" name. Its conceivable that you could get away with having the school write the check to you as an individual. But if you do that, it will show up as income on your taxes and you will have to deduct payments to the other tutors. If the organization already has a separate tax identity, then you could use that. Note that the organization will be responsible for paying income tax. It should be able to deduct payments to the tutors as well as marketing expenses, etc. If the school will go for it, consider structuring things with a payment to your organization for your organization duties. Then you tell the school how much to pay each tutor. You would be responsible for giving the school the necessary information, like name, address, Social Security number, and cost or possibly hours worked."

    "topic": "What exactly is a derivative?",
    "content": "A derivative is a financial instrument of a special kind, the kind whose price depends on, or is derived from, another asset. This definition is from John Hull, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives  a book definitely worth to own if you are curious about this, you can easily find old copies for a few dollars. The first point is that a derivative is a financial instrument, like credits, or insurances, the second point is that its price depends closely from the price of something else, the mentioned asset. In most cases derivatives can be understood as financial insurances against some risk bound to the asset. In the sequel I give a small list of derivatives and highlight the assets and the risk they can be bound to. And first, let me point out that the definition is marginally wrong because some derivatives depend on things which are not assets, nor do they have a price, like temperature, sunlight, or even your own life in the case of mortgages. But before going in this list, let me go through the remaining points of your question. What is the basic idea and concept behind a derivative? As already noted, in most cases, a derivative can be understood as a financial insurance compensating from a risk of some sort. In a classical insurance contract, one party of the contract is an insurance company, but in the broader case of a derivative, that counterparty can be pretty anything an insurance, a bank, a government, a large company, and most probably market makers. How is it really used, and how does this deviate from the first point? Briefly, how does is it affecting people, and how is it causing problems? An important point with derivatives is that it can be arbitrarily complicated to compute their prices. Actually what is hidden in the attempt of giving a definition for derivatives, is that they are products whose price Y is a measurable function of one or several random variables X1, X2,  Xn on which we can use the theory of arbitrage pricing to get hints on the actual price Y of the asset  this is what the depends on means in technical terms. In the most favorable case, we obtain an easy formula linking Y to the Xis which tells us what is the price of our financial instrument. But in practice, it can be very difficult, if at all possible, to determine a price for derivatives. This has two implications Persons possessing sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives have a strategic advantage on derivatives market, in comparison to less advanced actors on the market. Organisation owning assets they cannot price cannot compute their bilan anymore, so that they cannot know for sure their financial situation. They are somehow playing roulette. But wait, if derivatives are insurances they should help to mitigate some financial risk, which precisely means that they should help their owners to more accurately see their financial situation! How is this not a contradiction? Some persons with sophisticated techniques to compute the price of derivatives are actually selling complicated derivatives to less knowledgeable persons. For instance, many communes in France and Germany have contracted credits whose reimbursements have a fixed interest part, like in a classical credit, and a variable interest part whose rate is computed against a complicated formula involving the value of the Swiss frank at each quarter starting from the inception of the credit. So, for a 25 years running credit of theis type, the price Y of the credit at its inception depends on 100 Xs, which are the uncertain prices for the Swiss frank each quarter of the 25 next years. Some of these communes can be quite small, with 5.000 inhabitants, and needless to say, do not have the required expertise to analyse the risks bound to such instruments, which in that special case led the court call the credit a swindling and to cancel the credit. But what chain of events leads a 5.000 inhabitants city in France to own a credit whose reimbursements depends on the Swiss frank? After the credit crunch in 2007 and the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008, it has begun to be very hard to organise funding, which basically means to conclude credits running long in time on large amounts of money. So, the municipality needs a 25 years credit of 10.000.000 EUROS and goes to its communal bank. The communal bank has hundreds or thousands of municipalities looking for credits and needs itself a financing. So the communal bank goes to one of the five largest financial institutions in the world, which insists on selling a huge credit whose reimbursements have a variable part depending on hundred of values the Swiss frank will have in the 25 next years. Since the the big bank has better computation techniques than the small bank it makes a big profit. Since the small bank has no idea, how to compute the correct price of the credit it bought, it cuts this in pieces and sell it in the same form to the various communes it works with. If we were to attribute this kind of intentions to the largest five banks, we could ask about the possibility that they designed the credit to take advantage of the primitive evaluation methods of the small bank. We could also ask if they organised a cartel to force communal banks to buy their bermudean snowballs. And we could also ask, if they are so influent that they eventually can manipulate the Swiss frank to secure an even higher profit. But I will not go into this. To the best of my understanding, the subprime crisis is a play along the same plot, with different actors, but I know this latter subject only by what I could read in French newspapers. So much for the How is it causing problems? part. What is some of the terminology in relation to derivatives and there meanings of course? Answering this question is basically the purpose of the 7 first chapters of the book by Hull, along with deriving some important mathematical principles. And I will not copy these seven chapters here! How would someone get started dealing in derivatives Im playing a realistic stock market simulation, so it doesnt matter if your answer to this costs me money? If you ask the question, I understand that you are not a professional, so that your are actually trying to become the one that has money and zero knowledge in the play I outlined above. I would recommand not doing this. That said, if you have a good mathematical background and can program well, once you are confindent with the books of Hull and Joshi, you can have fun implementing various market models and implementing trading strategies. Once you are confident with this, you can also read the articles on quantitative finance on arXiv.org. And once you are done with this, you can decide for yourself if you want to play the same market as the guys writing these articles. And yes, even for the simplest options, they have better models than you have and will systematically outperform you in the long run, even if some random successes will give you the feeling that you do well and could do better. indeed, Ive made it a personal goal to somehow lose every last cent of my money You know your weapons!  Two parties agree today on a price for one to deliver a commodity to the other at some future instant. This is a classical future contract, it can be modified in every imaginable way, usually by embedding options. For instance one party could have the option to choose between different delivery points or delivery days. Two parties write today a contract allowing the one party to buy at some future time a commodity to the the second party. The price is written today, as part of the contract. There is the corresponding option entitling the owner to sell something. Unlike the future contract, only one party can be obliged to do something, the other jas a right but no obligation. If you buy and option, your are buying some sort of insurance against a change of price on some asset. This is the most familiar to anybody. Credits can come in many different flavours, especially the formula to compute interests, or also embed options. Common options are early settlement options or restructuration options. While this is not completely inutitive, the credit works like an insurance. This is most easily understood from the side of the organisation lending the money, that speculates that the ratio of creanciers going bankrupt will be low enough for her to make profit, just like a fire insurance company speculates that the ratio of fire accidents will be low enough for her to make a profit. This is like a mortgage on a financial institution. Two parties agree that one will recive an upfront today and give a compensation to the second one if some third party defaults. Here this is an explicit insurance against the unfortuante event, where a creancier goes bankrupt. One finds here more or less standard options on electricity. But electricity have delicious particularities as it can practically not be stored, and fallout is also usually avoided. As for classical options, these are insurances against price moves. A swap is like two complementary credits on the same amount of money, so that it ends up in the two parties not actually exchanging the credit nominal and only paying interest one to the other  which makes only sense if these interests are computed with different formulas. Typical example are fixed rate vs. EURIBOR on some given maturity, which we interpret as an insurance against fluctuations of the EURIBOR, or a fixed rate vs. the exchange ratio between two currencies, which we interpret as an insurance against the two currencies decorrelating. Swaps are the richest and the most generic category of financial derivatives. The offthecounter market features very imaginative, very customised insurance products. The most basic form is the insurance against drought, but you can image different dangers, and once you have it you can put it in options, in a swap, etc. For instance, a restaurant with a terrasse could enter in a weather insurance, paying each year a fixed amount of money and becoming in return an amount of money based on the amount of rainy day in a year. Actually, this list is virtually without limits!"

Thats a default value, though in my experience you can ask to be handled by another tax office. E.g. I hand my tax declaration to my \"home\" tax office where also my freelancing adress is, even though my dayjob is 300 km away. So if you work mostly from Poland and just visit the German customer a few times, you are fine anyways. Difficulties start if you move to Germany to do the work at your customers place. Im going to assume that this is the situation as otherwise I dont think the question would have come up. Close by the link you provided is a kind of FAQ on this EU regulation About the question of permanent vs. temporary they say The temporary nature of the service is assessed on a casebycase basis. Heres my GermanItalian experience with this. Background I had a work contract plus contracts for services and I moved for a while to Italy. Taxes and social insurance on the Italian contracts had to be paid to Italy. Including tax on the contract for services. Due to the GermanItalian tax treaty, there is no double taxation. Same for Poland this is part of EU contracts. By the way The temporary time frame for Italy seemed to be 3 months, then I had to provide an Italian residence etc. and was registered in the Italian health care etc. system. Due to the GermanItalian tax treaty, there is no double taxation. Same for Poland this is part of EU contracts. Besides that, the German tax office nevertheless decided that my \"primary center of life\" stayed in Germany. So everything but the stuff related to the Italian contracts which would probably have counted as normal work contracts in Germany, though they is no exact equivalent to those contract types was handled by the German tax office. I think this is the relevant part for your question or argumentation with the German tax office of temporary vs. permanent residence. Here are some points they asked There is one point you absolutely need to know about the German social insurance law Scheinselbstndigkeit pretended selfemployment. Scheinselbstndigkeit means contracts that claim to be service contracts with a selfemployed provider who is doing the work in a way that is typical for employees. This law closes a loophole so employer  employee cannot avoid paying income tax and social insurance fees pension contributions and unemployment insurance on both sides  health insurance would have to be paid in full by the selfemployed instead of partially by the employer. Employer also avoids accident insurance, and several regulations from labour law are avoided as well. Legally, this is a form of black labour which means that the employer commits a criminal offense and is liable basically for all those fees.

    "topic": "How should I go about creating an estate plan?",
    "content": "Yes, an estate plan can be very important. Estate planning  typically attempts to eliminate uncertainties over the administration of a probate and maximize the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses. Guardians are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in incapacity. In general, your \"estate\" includes all of your assets, less all debt, plus death benefits from all life insurance policies not held in an irrevocable trust. The biggest reason to have an estate plan is to make sure that your personal values about both medical and personal finance financial matters are honored in the event that death or incapacity prevents you from acting for yourself. In addition, tax minimization is a further and very important goal of estate planning for persons with taxable estates. To create an estate plan for yourself or update an existing plan, you will most likely need the services of an estate planning attorney. When you consult with an estate planning attorney, the attorney considers how you want assets distributed to heirs, what taxes might your estate be liable for and whether there are taxminimization strategies that would be appropriate and appealing what your preferences and values are with respect to the management of medical and financial affairs in the event of incapacity and any complicating family issues. To deal with these issues, your attorney will need full and accurate information about you, including When an estate plan is created, be sure you understand what the attorney is saying. Estate planning ideas can be confusing. It is also appropriate and expected for you to ask about the attorneys fee for any legal service.

    "content": "Not always. You always consider economic factors in conjunction with each other rather than in isolation, which leads to weird assumptions. People spending isnt what you should look at always. When inflation is high, means government is spending. Government is spending on public projects, creating employment, increasing salaries, doling out loans. So you are putting money into the economy and into peoples hands. Everybody will be spending, so it will also drive demandDemand Pull inflation. But there are differences among economists regarding Cost push inflation, which is a dangerous phenomena. At the same time the interest rates, which are a monetary tool for central banks to increasedecrease the money flow in the economy, are low. Under low interest rate conditions, businesses take loans to invest in projects. Because interest rates are low, people find it logical to spend now than spend later. As interest rates are low, there is an expectation that they cannot earn more in savings than investing in products which will generate benefits in the near term. These all goes on in cycles and after a period of inflation, you will see government taking action to rein in inflation. It will increase interest rates to suck money out of the economy. This is when people will curb spending, because they know they will earn a higher return while saving rather than investing."

    "content": "Yes, its a good idea to have a separate business account for your business because it makes accounting and bookkeeping that much easier. You can open a business checking account and there will be various options for types of accounts and fees. You may or may not want an overdraft account, for example, or a separate business credit card just so you can more easily separate those expenses from your personal cards. When I started my business, I opened a business checking account and met with my banker every year just to show them how the business was doing and to keep the relationship going. Eventually, when I wanted to establish a business line of credit, it was easier to set up because I they were already familiar with my business, its revenue, and needs for a line of credit. You can set up a solo 401k with your bank, too, and theyll be very happy to do so, but I recommend shopping around for options. Ive found that the dedicated investment firms Schwab, Fidelity, etc. tend to have better options, fees, and features for investment accounts. Just because a specific bank handles your checking account doesnt mean you need to use that bank for everything. Lastly, I use completely different banks for my personal life and for my business. Maybe Im paranoid, but I just dont want all my finances in the same place for both privacy reasons and to avoid having all my eggs in the same basket. Just something to consider  I dont really have a completely sane reason for using completely different banks, but it helps me sleep."

    "topic": "What are the benefits of opening an IRA in an unstableuncertain economy?",
    "content": "As I stated in my comment on JCottons answer, the only way you benefit by putting your money in an IRA or other taxdeferred vehicle is if you expect to have a lower tax rate when you withdraw than when you put the money in. If you look at JCottons numbers and remember to pay taxes when you withdraw the money in 30 years, you will see that both situations  paying taxes now or 30 years from now  give you the exact same dollar amount if the tax rates are the same at both points in time. So if you put money in an IRA, youre betting on the fact that the government will not substantially raise interest rates by then, andor that you will be in a lower tax bracket. To me, the only valid reasons to invest in an IRA or 401K are the following However, you should also consider the major downside that the money is locked away and, at best, inconvenient to access when you need it. At worst, you have to pay taxes and penalties if you ever withdraw that money. If you are a financially responsible person, I think youre generally better off keeping your money outside of an IRA or 401K, with the exception of making sure to get all of your employers matching contributions."

    "topic": "Is it accurate to say that if I was to trade something, my probability of success cant be worse than random?",
    "content": "In theory, in a perfect world, what you state is almost true. Apart from transaction fees, if you assume that the market is perfectly efficient ie public information is immediately reflected in a perfect reflection of future share value, in all share prices when the information becomes available, then in theory any transaction you would choose to take is opposed by a reasonable person who is not taking advantage of you, just moving their position around. This would make any and all transactions completely reasonable from a costbenefit perspective. ie if the future value of all dividends to be paid by Apple [ie the value of holding a share in Apple] exactly matches Apples share price of 1,000, then buying a share for 1,000 is an even trade. Selling a share for 1,000 is also an even trade. Now in a perfectly efficient market, which we have assumed, then there is no edge to valuing a company using your own methods. If you take Apples financial statements  press releases  reported information, and if you apply modern financial theory to evaluate the future dividends from Apple, you should get the same 1,000 share price that the market has already arrived at. So in this example, why wouldnt you just throw darts at a printout of the SP 500 and invest in whatever it lands on? Because, even if the perfectly efficient market agrees on the true value of something, different investments have different characteristics. As an example, consider a simple comparison of corporate bonds Corporations make bond offerings to the public, allowing individual investors to effectively lend money to the corporation, for a future benefit. For simplicity, assume a bond with a face value the amount to be repaid to the investor on maturity of 1,000 has these 3 defining characteristics 1 The price [What the investor pays to acquire it] 2 Interest payments [how much, if any, the corporation will pay to the investor before maturity, and when those payments will be made] and 3 a bond rating [which is a third party assessment of how risky the bond is, based on the health of the corporation]. Now if the bond rating agency is perfect in its risk assessment, and if the price of all bonds is fair, then why does it matter who you loan your money to? It matters because different people want different things out of their investments. If you are waiting to make a down payment on a house next year, then you dont want risk  you want to be certain that you will get your cash back, even if it means lower returns. So, even though a highrisk bond may be perfectly priced, it should only be bought by someone willing to bear that risk. If you are retired, and you need your bonds to pay you interest regularly as your sole source of income, then of course a zerocoupon bond [one that pays no interest] is not helpful to you. If you are young, and have a long time to invest, then you may want risk, because you have time to overcome losses and you want to get the most return possible. In addition, taxes are not universal between all investors. Some people benefit from things that would be taxheavy to their neighbors. For example in Canada, there is a dividend tax credit which reduces the taxes owing on dividends received by a corporation. This credit exists to prevent doubletaxation, because otherwise the corporation would pay its 30 of tax, and then a wealthy investor would pay another 45 of tax. Due to the mechanics of how the credit is calculated, however, someone who makes less money, gets an even lower tax bill than they normally would. This means that someone making under the top tax bracket in Canada, has a tax benefit by receiving dividends. This means that while 2 stocks may be both fairly priced, if one pays dividends and the other doesnt [ie if the other company instead reinvests more heavily in future projects, creating even more value for shareholders down the road], then someone in the bottom tax brackets may want the dividend paying stock more than the other. In conclusion Picking investments yourself does require some knowledge to prevent yourself from making a bad buy this is because the market is not perfectly efficient. As well, specific market mechanics make some trades more costly than they should be in theory consider for example transaction fees and tax mechanics. Finally, even if you assume that all of the above is irrelevant as a theoretical idea, different investors still have different needs. Just because 1,000,000 is the fair price for a factory in your home town, doesnt mean you might as well convert your retirement savings to buy it as your sole asset."

    "content": "Yes, its possible. However, its not likely, at least not for most people. Earning a million is not that difficult, but when you talk about billions thats an entirely different story. I think the key point that youre missing is leverage. Its common knowledge that Warren Buffett likes to have a huge cash warchest at his disposal and does not soak himself in debt. However, in his early years Buffett did not get to where hes at by investing only his own money. He ran what was basically a hedge fund and leveraged other peoples money in the market. This magnified his returns quite substantially. If you look at Buffetts investments, youll notice that he had a handful of HUGE wins in his portfolio and many more just mediocre success stories. Not everything he invested in turned to gold, but his portfolio was rocketed by the large wins that continued to compound over many years because he held them for so long. Also, consider the fact that Buffetts wealth is largely measured in Berkshire stock. This stock is a reflection of anticipated future earnings by the company. Theres no way that alone could turn 10k in 1950 into 50B today... could it? Why not? Take the two founders of Google for example, they became billionaires in short order when Google had its IPO and basically started in a garage with very little cash. Of course, they didnt do this by buying and selling shares. There are many paths to earnings enormous sums of money like the people youre talking about, but one characteristic that the richest people in society seem to have in common is that they all own their own companies."

    "content": "Even where national law might allow such a practice, the law in an individual province or state either for issuing or receiving bank might not or if that does then the receiving bank may have its own regulations or compliance practice which may not permit them to accept an altered cheque. In any case, printed numbers are usually machinereadable, and a corrected cheque would not be. The question needs a specific answer which addresses the specific circumstances involved which are not stated, at the time of writing this, but for the general question Should I alter a printed cheque? the answer must be no. Cheque numbers are used for identification of the cheque. In many cases, there is no verification of uniqueness and it would be perfectly acceptable simply to use cheques with duplicate numbers a cheque is merely an order to the bank to make a payment. But you would not be able to identify a particular payment on your statement, and neither would the issuing bank if you wanted one stopped. Where the number is verified as unique, then clearing the payment may be refused or at best delayed in order to be queried. Making an obvious amendment to a cheques details is likely to raise a red flag. The receiving bank would not be able to tell if you did it, or the payee they would not know why. They may suspect that it was done in order to render the cheque unidentifiable [even though the opposite is in fact the case] and refuse to accept it. They may refuse to accept it because it could not be read automatically. Any refusal would sour your relationship with your payees. Presumably your printing house or your bank, if they printed them has made the error raise it with them and have them reprint the batch. Ask your bank what to do with the incorrect cheques they may want them returned to the bank, or they may be happy for you to keep and even use them. If the latter, I suggest you shred them."

    "topic": "Options for dummies. Can you explain how puts  calls work, simply?",
    "content": "Put Options for Kids You have a big box of candy bars. You saved up your allowance to get a lot of them, so you could have one whenever you want one. But, you just saw a commercial on TV for a new toy coming out in one month. Your allowance alone wont buy it, and you want that toy more than you want the candy. So, you decide that youll sell the candy to your friends at school to buy the toy. Now, you have a choice. You can sell the candy now, and put the money in your piggy bank to buy the toy later. Or, you can save the candy, and sell it in a month when you actually need the money to buy the toy. You know that if you sell all the candy you have today, you can get 50 cents a bar. Thats not quite enough to buy the toy, but your allowance will cover the rest. What you dont know is how much you might be able to sell the candy for in a month. You might be able to get 75 cents a bar. If you did, you could pay for the toy with just the money from the candy and even have some left over. But, you might only be able to sell them for 25 cents each, and you wouldnt have enough to buy the toy even with your allowance. Youd like to wait and see if you could get 75 cents each, but you dont want to risk getting only 25 cents each. So, you go to your father. He and his coworkers like these candy bars too, so hed be willing to buy them all and sell them to his friends the way youre planning to do with yours. You ask for the option to sell him all the candy bars for 50 cents each in one month. If you find out you can get more for them at school, you want to be able to take that deal, but if you cant sell them for 50 cents at school, youll sell them to your dad. Now, your dad knows that he could have the same problem selling the candy at 50 cents or more that you are afraid of. So, he offers a compromise. If you pay him 5 now, hell agree to the deal. You figure that even without that 5, between your allowance and the candy money, you can still buy the toy. So, you take the deal. In one month, you can offer the candy at school. If nobody will pay 50 cents, you can sell the candy to your dad when you get home, but if the kids at school will pay 50 cents or more, you can sell it all at school. Either way, you have enough money to buy the toy, and you can also choose which price to accept, but you had to pay your dad 5, and you cant get that back, so if it turns out that you can sell the candy at school for 50 cents, same as today, then because you paid the 5 you dont end up with as much as if youd simply waited. In the financial market, this type of option is a \"put option\". Someone who owns something thats traded on the market, like a stock, can arrange to sell that stock to someone else at an agreedon price, and the seller can additionally pay some money to the buyer up front for the option to not sell at that price. Now, if the stock market goes up, the seller lets the contract expire and sells his stock on the open market. If it goes down, he can exercise the option, and sell at the agreedupon price to the buyer. If, however, the stock stays about the same, whether he chooses to sell or not, the money the seller paid for the option means he ends up with less than he would have if he hadnt bought the option. Call Options for Kids Lets say that you see another ad on TV for another toy that you like, that was just released. You check the suggested retail price on the companys web site, and you see that if you save your allowance for the next month, you can buy it. But, in school the next day, everybodys talking about this toy, saying how they want one. Some already have enough money, others are saving up and will be able to get it before you can. Youre afraid that because everyone else wants one, itll drive up the price for them at the local store, so that your months allowance will no longer buy the toy. So, you go to your dad again. You want to be able to use your allowance money for the next month to buy the new toy. Youre willing to wait until you actually have the money saved up before you get the toy, but you need that toy in a month. So, you want your dad to buy one for you, and hold it until you can save up to buy it from him. But, you still want it both ways if the price goes down in a month because the toys not so new anymore and people dont want it, you dont want to spend your entire months allowance buying the one from your dad you just want to go to the store and buy one at the lower price. Youll pay him 5 for the trouble, right now, whether you buy the toy he got you or not. Your dad doesnt want to have a toy hes not using sitting around for a month, especially if you might not end up buying it from him, so he offers a different deal In one month, if you still want it, hell stop by the store on his way home and pick up the toy. Youll then reimburse him from the allowance you saved up if it ends up costing less than a months allowance, so be it, but if it costs more than that, you wont have to pay any more. This will only cost you 3, because its easier for him. But, because hes not buying it now, there is a small chance that the item will be out of stock when he goes to buy it, and youll have to wait until its back in stock. You agree, on the condition that if you have to wait longer than a month for your toy, because he couldnt get one to sell you, he pays you back your 3 and knocks another 5 off the cost to buy the toy from him. The basic deal to buy something at an agreed price, with the option not to do so, is known as a \"call option\". Someone who wishes to buy some stocks, bonds or commodities at a future date can arrange a deal with someone who has what they want to buy them at a specific price. The buyer can then pay the seller for the option to not buy. The counteroffer Dad made, where he will buy the toy from the store at whatever price he can find it, then sell it to you for the agreed price, is known as a \"naked call\" in finance. It simply means that the seller, who is in this case offering the option to the buyer, doesnt actually have what they are agreeing to sell at the future date, and would have to buy it on the open market in order to turn around and sell it. This is typically done when the seller is confident that the price will go down, or wont go up by much, between now and the date of the contract. In those cases, either the buyer wont exercise the option and will just buy what they want on the open market, or theyll exercise the option, but the difference between what the seller is paying to buy the commodity on the market and what hes getting by selling it on contract is within the price he received for the option itself. If, however, the price of an item skyrockets, the seller now has to take a significant, real loss of money by buying something and then selling it for far less than he paid. If the item flatout isnt available, the buyer is usually entitled to penalties for the sellers failure to deliver. If this is all understood by both parties, it can be thought of as a form of insurance."

    "content": "In the event that payment is not made by the due date on the invoice then the transaction is essentially null and void and you can sell the work to another client. For your particular situation I would strongly suggest that you implement a sales contract and agreement of original transfer of work of art for any and all future sales of your original works of art. In this contract you need to either enforce payment in full at time of signing or a deposit at signing with payment in full within X amount of days and upon delivery of item. In your sales contract you will want to stipulate a late fee in the event that the client does not pay the balance by the date specified, and a clause that stipulates how long after the due date that you will hold the artwork before the client forfeiting deposit and losing rights to the work. You will also want to specify an amount of time that you provide as a grace period in the event client changes their mind about the purchase, and you can make it zero grace period, making all sales final and upon signing of the agreement the client agrees to the terms and is locked into the sale. In which point if they back out they forfeit all deposits paid. I own a custom web design business and we implement a similar agreement for all works that we create for a client, requiring a 50 deposit in advance of work being started, an additional 25 at time of client accepting the designlayout and the final 25 at delivery of finished product. In the event that a client fails to meet the requirements of the contract for the second or final installment payments the client forfeits all money paid and actually owes us 70 of total quoted project price for wasting our time. We have only had to enforce these stipulations on one client in 5 years! The benefit to you for requiring a deposit if payment is not made in full is that it ensures that the client is serious about purchasing the work because they have put money in the game rather than just their word of wanting to purchase. Think of it like putting earnest money down when you make an offer to buy a house. Hope this helps!"

Your profit is 5000 0.50  2500. Fast money? If you are lucky. Lets say before the price went up to 20.50, it had a slight dip down to 19.80. Your loss was 5000 0.2  1000. Wait!

The broker willingly gives you this credit, since he can be sure he wont loose a cent. Of course you pay interest for the money you are trading with, but its only for minutes. So to answer your question You dont care when you have \"your money\" back, the trading company will always be there to give you more as long as you have deposit left. I thought no one should get margin explained without the warning why it is a horrible idea to full use the ridiculous high margins some broker offer. 110 might or might not be fine, but 1100 is harakiri."

When a mortgage broker pulls your credit, they will pull the latest balances with the minimum payments. This is what is taken to determine DTI along with your gross monthly income. If you do not pay your account in full before the statement date, then you more than likely will have to wait an additional statement cycle before it reports to the credit bureaus. Therefore, your utilization is dynamic and the history of your utilization monthtomonth is not recorded forever. Only the current balance. What is maintained and reported is your payment history. So you want to never be late if you want to be approved anytime soon for a mortgage. A lower DTI will not help your interest rate. As long as you stay away from the maximum DTI for the mortgage vehicle you are attempting to be approved for VA, FHA, Conventional, etc, then your DTI should not be a concern. If you are borderline at the time of underwriting, you can take the opportunity and pay off the balances. The mortgage company can then do what is called a credit supplement which entails contacting those lenders where you have proven you have a zero balance and manually input the zero balance cards, that have not yet reported to the bureaus, in your final application to the mortgage company for underwriting approval."

Theres also a segment of the population that dont quite understand the \"big picture\" of how service professions work... for example, any group of friends going into a restaurant and requesting a table and sitting at it for over an hour, but feel they dont need to leave a tip because they only ordered espressos or shared a desert. Sure, youre paying for the service of a service professional, but it should also include their time and resources you consume outside of the actual service but many dont have that perspective. Why should I pay you if you arent providing your actual \"service\" to me even though Im consuming your time and resources that would be earning you your expected salary otherwise, is their justification. So when you encounter an individual from both small segments of the population mentioned above, the result is the problem your wife faces with perspective buyers. I look at the Agent  Buyer relationship from a different perspective when I encounter these noharm intended individuals. I dont see it as the buyer is hiring the agent... for if that was the case, a contract of some sorts would be involved detailing the menu of services provided by the agent with associated costs, the buyer would make selections from the menu, pay the costs, and services rendered. but thats not how it works. so its important to understand the perspective of the agent looking to hire the buyer.. youre not paying the buyer to be your client, but you are looking to select the prospective buyer thats going to generate cash flow. In a commissions based work force that is also your main source of income, you have to look at prospective clients as that.. simply prospects..but who are a vital component of your salary. So when allocating your time and resources, especially if youre dealing with several prospects, you literally have to turn away these cold leads who are just looking for design tips and paint color pattern suggestions and you as their escort. If I was in the shoemaking business, i wouldnt hire a walkin, give him access to materials and work space with the assumption that if its to his liking, itll generate profit towards my salary needs, if the only thing hes interested in doing is looking around at all the other shoes, a behavior that requires my presence, time, and resources. You almost cant even justify it as \"looking at it as possible income in the future\" if its costing you revenue now, whether its in the form of having to neglect actual buyers or you could be investing your time in things that would impact salary needs, such as advance course work attending optional trainings offered by your broker, or investing time finding more serious leads."

I read the comments and you seemed unsure about certain things. Once you know where your money is going, you can do a much better job of saving it. Retirement Savings Contribute up to the employer match on the 401ks, if its greater than the 5 you are already contributing. Open a Roth IRA account for each of you and make the max contribution around 5k each. I would also suggest finding a financial adviser w the heart of a teacher to recommenddirect your mutual fund investing in those Roth IRAs and in your regular mutual fund investments. Emergency Fund With the 85k savings, take it down to a six month emergency fund. To calculate your emergency fund, look at what your necessary expenses are for a month, then multiply it by six. You could place that six month emergency fund in ING Direct as littleadv suggested. Thats where we have our emergency funds and long term savings. This is a bareminimum type budget, and is based on something like losing your job  in which case, you dont need to go to starbucks 5 times a week I dont know if you do or not, but that is an easy example for me to use. You should have something left over, unless your basic expenses are above 7083mo. Nonretirement Investing Whatever is left over from the 85k, start investing with it. I suggest you look into mutual funds it. Some may say buy stocks, but individual stocks are very risky and you could lose your shirt if you dont know what youre doing. Mutual funds typically are comprised of many stocks, and you earn based on their collective performance. You have done very well, and Im very excited for you. Childs College Savings If you guys decide to expand your family with a child, youll want to fund whats typically called a 529 plan to fund his or her college education. The money grows tax free and is only taxed when used for noneducation expenses. You would fund this for the max contribution each year as well currently 2k but that could change depending on how the Bush Tax cuts are handled at the end of this year.

Because of this timing, they are sometimes called \"spillover\" contributions. Usually, this option is advertised as a way of continuing to get company match even if you accidentally hit the pretax limit. But if you actually pay attention to your finances, it is instead a handy way to put away additional taxadvantaged money. That said, you would only want to use this option if you already maxed out your pretax and Roth options since you dont get the traditional tax break on contributions or the Roth tax break on the earnings. However, when you leave the company, you can transfer the posttax money directly into a Roth IRA when you transfer the pretax money, match, and earnings into a traditional IRA."

Those countries average out to 83.42 on the Fragile State index, which would be in the \"Very High Warning\" range and includes 18 countries in the \"Alert\", \"High Alert\", or \"Very High Alert\" status.

    "topic": "Is it ever logical to not deposit to a matched 401k account?",
    "content": "Some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt. Some things to consider before doing that Check your 401k plan first. Some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company, some do not. If you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan, you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the IRS will treat this as an early withdrawal, which means taxes and penalties. If you dont have another job lined up, this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government depending on your state, it may be up to 50 of the remaining amount. There are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments. There is no such option with a 401k plan. This may change your taxes at the end of the year. Most people can deduct student loan interest payments. You cannot deduct interest paid to your 401k loan. You are paying the interest to yourself though. It may hurt your long term growth potential. Currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4 range. If you are able to make more than 4 inside of your 401k, you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back. It may limit flexibility for a few years. When people fall on hard times, their 401k is their last resort. Some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time. You may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future. Once you take the money out for a loan, you cant access it again. See the first bullet about working with student loan vendors, they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances. 401k loans dont. Amortization schedule. Many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years, if you currently have 10 year loans, can you afford to pay the same debt back in 12 the time at a lower rate? You will have to do the math. When considering debt other than student loans such as credit cards, if you fall on hard times, you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe, or the debt can be discharged with tax penalties of course. They cant make you take money out. Once it is out, it is fair game. Just to clarify, the above isnt saying you shouldnt do it under any circumstances, it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice. The 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you cant work. The numbers may work out in the short term, but do they still work out in the long term? Most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 710 years, so does shortening that to 5 or less make up for the probably early years of compounding interest for your retirement? I think others have addressed some of this so I wont do the math. I can tell you that I have a 401k loan, and when things got iffy at my job for, it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because, unlike other debts, there isnt much you can do about it."

    "content": "The difficulty with investing in mining and gold company stocks is that they are subject to the same market forces as any other stocks, although they may whether those forces better in a crisis than other stocks do because they are related to gold, which has always been a \"flight to safety\" move for investors. Some investors buy physical gold, although you dont have to take actual delivery of the metal itself. You can leave it with the brokerdealer you buy it from, much the way you dont have your broker send you stock certificates. That way, if you leave the gold with the brokerdealer someone reputable, of course, like APMEX or Monex then you can sell it quickly if you choose, just like when you want to sell a stock. If you take delivery of a security share certificate or commodity gold, oil, etc. then before you can sell it, you have to return it to broker, which takes time. The decision has much to do with your investing objectives and willingness to absorb risk. The reason people choose mutual funds is because their money gets spread around a basket of stocks, so if one company in the fund takes a hit it doesnt wipe out their entire investment. If you buy gold, you run the risk low, in my opinion of seeing big losses if, for some reason, gold prices plummet. Youre \"all in\" on one thing, which can be risky. Its a judgment call on your part, but thats my two cents worth."

    "content": "I want to caveat that I am not an active investor in Australia, you most likely should seek out other investors in your market and ask them for advicementorship, but since you came here I can give you some generalized advice. When investing in real estate there are a two main rules of thumb to quickly determine if the property will be a good investment. The 50 rule and the 2 or 1 rule. The 50 rules says that in general 50 if the income from the property will go to expenses not including debt service. If you are bringing in 1000 a month 500 of that will go to utilities, taxes, repair, capital expenditures, advertising, lawn care, etc. That leave you with 500 to pay the mortgage and if anything is left that can be cash flow. As this is your first property and it is in \" a relatively bad neighbourhood\" you might consider bumping that up to 60 just to make sure you have padding. The 1 or 2 rules says that the monthly rent should be 1or 2 percent of the purchase price in this case the home is bought at 150,000. If the rent is 1,500 a month it might be a good investment but if it rents for 3,000 a month it probably is a good investment. There are other factors to consider if a home meets the 2 rule it might be in a rough neighborhood which increases turnover which in general is the biggest expense in an investment property. If a property meets one or both of these rules you should take a closer look at it and with proper due diligence determine that it is a deal. These rules are just hard and fast guidelines to property analysis, they may need to be adapted to you market. For example these rules will not hold in most all? big cities."

The key to a successful credit card is to both sign up lots of borrowers AND lots of merchants. Credit card fortunes have improved dramatically since the 1990s when formerly offlimits merchants like grocery stores began to accept cards. So when a credit card lets you just pull cash out of any ATM, there are a few costs they need to account for when pricing the cost for such a service Credit card banks have managed to make cash advances both a profit center and a selfserving perk. Knowing that you can always draw upon your credit line for an emergency when cash is necessary makes you less likely to actually carry cash and more likely to just rely on your credit card."

    "content": "It has been hinted at in some other answers, but I want to say it explicitly Volatility is not risk. Volatility is how much an investment goes up and down, risk is the chance that you will lose money. For example, stocks have relatively high volatility, but the risk that you will lose money over a 40 year period is virtually zero in particular if you invest in index funds. Bonds, on the other hand, have basically no volatility their cash flow is totally predictable if you trust the future of your government, but there is a significant risk that they will perform worse than stocks over a longer period. So, volatility equals risk only if you are day trading. A 401k is literally the opposite of that. For further reading Never confuse risk and volatility Also, investing is not gambling. Gambling is bad because the odds are stacked against you. You need more than average luck to actually win and the longer you play, the more you will lose. Investing means buying productive capital that will produce further value. The odds are in your favor. Even if you do a moderately bad job at investing, the longer you stay, the more you will win."

Do I need to discount the cashflow to the present, and if so, how? Yes, you need to discount every cash flow to the present time, not just the first one. When discounting cash flows, the appropriate discount rate needs to represent the opportunity cost of the initial cash outlay. Meaning if you were to use that money for something else, what rate of return would you expect? You could be safe and assume only a riskfree return like 23 or use the average rate of return of other investments e.g. 1015. Another common approach is to use your cost of capital if youre raising funds for the project, or would instead have use the funds to pay off existing debt. Once you find a relevant discount rate, then just discount each cash flow by dividing them by ert, where r is the annualized discount rate e.g. 0.10 for 10 and t is the decimal number of years between now and the cash flow e.g. 1.5 for 18 months"

Usually the amounts are very low, and are not paid in cash. While it is income, I doubt the IRS will chase you if you dont report the 20 Amazon gift card you got from there. It should, strictly speaking, be reported probably as hobby income on your tax return. Most people dont bother dealing with such small amounts though. In some cases like the HMO I mentioned, its basically a rebate of the money paid you pay your copays, deductibles etc. Since the surveys are only for members, you basically get your money back, not additional income. This is in fact similar to credit card rebates. Is there a best practice for handling the income? If were talking about significant amounts more than 2030 a year, then you need to keep track of the income and related expenses, and report it as any other business income on your taxes, Schedule C. Is there a good test to determine what is and isnt a scam? As I said  if it looks too good to be true  it most likely is. If youre required to provide your personalfinancial information without any explanation as to why, what it will be used for, and why and what for youre going to be paid  Id walk away. Otherwise, you can also check Internet reviews, BBB ratings, FTC information and the relevant state agencies and consumer watchdogs for example httpwww.scamadviser.com whether theyve heard of that particular site, and what is the information they have on it. A very good sign for a scam is contact information. Do they have a phone number to call to? Is it in your own country? If its not in your own country  definitely go away for example the original link that was in the question pointed to a service whose phone number is in the UK, but listed address is in Los Angeles, CA. A clear sign of a scam. If they do have a phone number  try it, talk to them, call several times and see how many different people youre going to talk to. If its always the same person  run and hide. Do they have an address? If not  walk away. If they do  look it up. Is it a PMBPOB? A \"virtual\" office? Or do they have a proper office set up, which you can see on the map and in the listings as their office? And of course your guts. If your guts tell you its a scam  it very likely is."

    "content": "There are several variables to consider. Taxes, fees, returns. Taxes come in two stages. While adding money to the account you can save on state taxes, if the account is linked to your state. If you use an out of state 529 plan there is no tax savings. Keep in mind that other people such as grandparents can set aside money in the 529 plan. 1500 a year with 6 state taxes, saves you 90 in state taxes a year. The second place it saves you taxes is that the earnings, if they are used for educational purposes are tax free. You dont pay taxes on the gains during the 10 years the account exists. If those expenses meet the IRS guidelines they will never be taxed. It does get tricky because you cant double dip on expenses. A dollar from the 529 plan cant be used to pay for an expenses that will be claimed as part of the education tax credit. How those rules will change in the next 18 years is unknown. Fees They are harder to guess what will happen over the decades. As a whole 401k programs have had to become more transparent regarding their fees. I hope the same will be true for the state run 529 programs. Returns One option in many all? plans is an automatic change in risk as the child gets closer to college. A newborn will be all stock, a high school senior will be all bonds. Many all? also allow you to opt out of the automatic risk shift, though they will limit the number of times you can switch the option. Time horizon Making a decision that will impact numbers 18 years from now is hard to gauge. Laws and rules may change. The existence of tax breaks and their rules are hard to predict. But one area you can consider is that if you move states you can roll over the money into a new account, or create a second account in the new state. to take advantage of the tax breaks there. There are also rules regarding transferring of funds to another person, the impact of scholarships, and attending schools like the service academies. The tax breaks at deposit are important but the returns can be significant. And the ability shelter them in the 529 is very important."

Also there are sales companies that specialize in these kinds of things bringing manufacturers of goods together with customers. The sales companies never take delivery of the product, just a commission on the sales. From this the manufacturers are served as they have gained a customer for their goods. The buying company is served as they can make a \"better\" end product. The two parties may have not been brought together had it not been for the sales company so on some level both are happy to pay for the service. Can you find market inequalities and profit from them? Sure. I missed a great opportunity recently. I purchased a name brand shirt from a discount store for 20. Those shirts typically sell on ebay for 80. I should have cleaned out that stores inventory, and I bet someone else did as by the time I went back they were gone. That kind of thing was almost riskless because if the shirts did not sell, I could simply return them for the full purchase price. That and I can afford to buy a few hundred dollars worth of shirts. Can you afford to float 45K CDN? What if it takes a year to sell the car? What if the economy goes sour and you are left \"holding the bag\"? Why are not car dealers doing exactly what you propose? Here in the US this type of thing is called \"horse trading\" and is very common. Ive both lost and made money on these kind of deals. I would never put a significant amount of my net worth at risk."

The FX spread will be much better than you would get from a bank since FX is their primary business. The additional risk you take on is settlement risk. XE will not pay the sterling amount to your UK bank account until they have received the Euro payment into their account. If XE went bankrupt before crediting your UK account, but after youve paid them your Euros  you could lose your money. XE is backed by Custom House, which is a large and established Canadian firm  so this risk is very small indeed.

    "topic": "How can I figure out how much to bid on a parking space?",
    "content": "Scenario 1 Assume that you plan to keep the parking space for the rest of your life and collect the income from the rental. You say these spaces rent for 250 per month and there are fees of 1400 per year. Are there any other costs? Like would you be responsible for the cost of repaving at some point? But assuming thats covered in the 1400, the net profit is 250 x 12  1400  1600 per year. So now the question becomes, what other things could you invest your money in, and what sort of returns do those give? If, say, you have investments in the stock market that are generating a 10 annual return and you expect that rate of return to continue indefinitely, than if you pay a price that gives you a return of less than 10, i.e. if you pay more than 16,000, then you would be better off to put the money in the stock market. That is, you should calculate the fair price \"backwards\" What return on investment is acceptable, and then what price would I have to pay to get that ROI? Oh, you should also consider what the \"occupancy rate\" on such parking spaces is. Is there enough demand that you can realistically expect to have it rented out 100 of the time? When one renter leaves, how long does it take to find another? And do you have any information on how often renters fail to pay the rent? I own a house that I rent out and I had two tenants in a row who failed to pay the rent, and the legal process to get them evicted takes months. I dont know what it takes to \"evict\" someone from a parking space. Scenario 2 You expect to collect rent on this space for some period of time, and then someday sell it. In that case, theres an additional piece of information you need How much can you expect to get for this property when you sell it? This is almost surely highly speculative. But you could certainly look at past pricing trends. If you see that the value of a parking space in your area has been going up by, whatever, say 4 per year for the past 20 years, its reasonable to plan on the assumption that this trend will continue. If its been up and down and all over the place, you could be taking a real gamble. If you pay 30,000 for it today and when the time comes to sell the best you can get is 15,000, thats not so good. But if there is some reasonable consistent average rate of growth in value, you can add this to the expected rents. Like if you can expect it to grow in value by 1000 per year, then the return on your investment is the 1600 in rent plus 1000 in capital growth equals 2600. Then again do an ROI calculation based on potential returns from other investments."

    "content": "If you really believe in the particular stocks, then dont worry about their daily price. Overall if the company is sound, and presumably paying a dividend, then youre in it for the long haul. Notwithstanding that, it is reasonable to look for a way out. The two you describe are quite different in their specifics. Selling sounds like the simpler of the two, but the trigger event, and if it is automatic or \"manual\" matters. If you are happy to put in a sell order at some time in the future, then just go ahead with that. Many brokers can place a STOP order, that will trigger on a certain price threshold being hit. Do note, however, that by default this would place a market order, and depending on the price that breaks through, in the event of a flash crash, depending on how fast the brokers systems were, you could find yourself selling quite cheaply. A STOP LIMIT order will place a limit order at a triggered price. This would limit your overall downside loss, but you might not sell at all if the market is really running away. Options are another reasonable way to deal with the situation, sort of like insurance. In this case you would likely buy a PUT, which would give you the right, but not the obligation to sell the stock at the price the that was specified in the option. In this case, no matter what, you are out the price of the option itself hence my allusion to insurance, but if the event never happens then that was the price you paid to have that peace of mind. I cannot recommend a specific course of action, but hopefully that fleshed out the options you have."

Your Credit History in US is tied to your SSN Social Security Number, which will be awarded once you are in the country legally and apply for it. Getting an SSN also doesnt guarantee you nothing and you have to build your credit history slowly. Opening a Checking or Savings account will not help you in building a credit history. You need to have some type of Credit Account credit card, car loan, mortgage etc. linked to your SSN to start building your credit history. When you are new to US, you probably wont find any bank that will give you a Credit Card as you have no Credit history. One alternative is to apply for a secured credit card. A secured credit card is one you get by putting money or paying money to a bank and open a Credit Card against that money, thereby the bank can be secure that they wont lose any money. Once you have that, you can use that to build up your credit history slowly and once you have a good credit history and score, apply for regular Credit Card or apply for a car loan, mortgage etc. When I came to US 8 years ago, my Credit History was nothing, even though I had pretty good balance and credit history back in my country. I applied for secured credit card by paying 500 to a bank  which got acquired by CapitalOne , got it approved and used it for everything, for three years. I applied for other cards in the mean time but got rejected every time. Finally got approved for a regular credit card after three years and in one year added a mortgage and car loan, which helped me to get a decent score now. And Yes, a good Credit Score is important and essential for renting an apartment, leasing a car, getting a Credit Card etc. but normally your employer can always arrange for an apartment given your situation or you need to share apartment with someone else. You can rent a car without and credit score, but need a valid US  International Drivers license and a Credit Card  Best option will be to open a secured credit card and start building your credit. When your wife and family arrives, they also will be assigned individual SSN and can start building their credit history themselves.

Ex Lets say that you have the following  Visa cc with 10,000 limit and 2000 worth of purchases made more than 30 days ago on it.

Hypothetical situation You want a bank loan to do some expensive house repairs and are looking for a lower interest rate than what your cc can offer. The bank will not care about the amount on the cards. They will addup all the limits of your cc and treat your loan request as if ALL your cards were filled to their respective limit. So in this case they will consider you as being right now in debt of 10K10K2K  22,000 instead of only 3000 and they might 1. refuse you the loan 2. grant it only if you transfer all purchases on a single card and cancel all the others. 3.

That way, the funds are in one central account and available to invest. Plus it eliminates the mandatory 20 withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan.

How to decide when the stock market is in a bear market is a separate question. You earn a 100 return immediately on money that receives the company match  provided that you stay at the company long enough for the company match to \"vest\". This immediate 100 return far exceeds the 3.25 return by paying down debt. As long as it makes sense to keep your retirement funds in lowrisk, lowreturn investments, it makes more sense to use your remaining free cash flow to pay down debts than to save extra money in retirement funds. After setting aside the 6 of your income that is eligible for the company match, you should be able to rapidly pay down your debts. This will make it far easier for you to qualify for a mortgage later on. Also, if you can pay off your debt in a couple years, you will minimize your risk from the proposed variable rate. First, there will be fewer chances for the rate to go up. Second, even if the rate does go up, you will not owe the money very long."

    "content": "When you say \"apartment\" I take it you mean \"condo\", as youre talking about buying. Right or no? A condo is generally cheaper to buy than a house of equal size and coondition, but they you have to pay condo fees forever. So youre paying less up front but you have an ongoing expense. With a condo, the condo association normally does exterior maintenance, so its not your problem. Find out exactly whats your responsibility and whats theirs, but you typically dont have to worry about maintaining the parking areas, you have less if any grass to mow, you dont have to deal with roof or outside walls, etc. Of course youre paying for all this through your condo fees. There are two advantages to getting a shorter term loan Because you owe the money for less time, each percentage point of interest is less total cash. 1 time 15 years versus 1 times 30 years or whatever. Also, you can usually get a lower rate on a shorter term loan because theres less risk to the bank they only have to worry about where interest rates might go for 15 years instead of 30 years. So even if you know that you will sell the house and pay off the loan in 10 years, youll usually pay less with a 15 year loan than a 30 year loan because of the lower rate. The catch to a shorterterm loan is that the monthly payments are higher. If you cant afford the monthly payment, then any advantages are just hypothetical. Typically if you have less than a 20 down payment, you have to pay mortgage insurance. So if you can manage 20 down, do it, it saves you a bundle. Every extra dollar of down payment is that much less that youre paying in interest. You want to keep an emergency fund so I wouldnt put every spare dime I had into a down payment if I could avoid it, but you want the biggest down payment you can manage. Well, one can debate whether its better to use spare cash to invest in the stock market or some other investment rather than paying down the mortgage. Whole different question. \"I dont think its a good idea to make any principal payments as I would probably loose them when I would want to sell the house and pay off the mortgage\" Im not sure what youre thinking there. Any extra principle payments that you make, youll get back when you sell the house. I mean, suppose you buy a house for 100,000, over the time you own it you pay 30,000 in principle between regular payments and any extra payments, and then you sell it for 120,000. So out of that 120,000 youll have to pay off the 70,000 balance remaining on the loan, leaving 50,000 to pay other expenses and whatever is left goes in your pocket. Scenario 2, you buy the house for 100,000, pay 40,000 in principle, and sell for 120,000. So now you subtract 60,000 from the 120,000 leaving 60,000. You put in an extra 10,000, but you get it back when you sell. Whether you make or lose money on the house, whatever extra principle you put in, youll get back at sale time in terms of less money that will have to go to pay the remaining principle on the mortgage."

And keep in mind that these only provide estimates, because there are still a lot of variables that are only considered when youre actually filling out your real tax return. There are a number of calculators if you search for something like \"tax estimator calculator\", some are more sophisticated than others. Fair warning I used several of these and they told me a range of 2k  25k worth of taxes owed for a situation like yours. Heres an estimator from TurboTax  its handy because it lets you enter business income. When I plug in 140K 70  40 hours  50 weeks for business income in 2010, married filing jointly, no spouse income, and 4 dependents, I get 30K owed in federal taxes. That doesnt include local taxes, any itemized deductions you might be eligible for, IRA deductions, etc. You may also be able to claim some expenses as business deductions that will reduce your taxable business income. So youd net 110K after taxes, or about 55hour 110k  50  40. Of course, you could get an answer from the calculator, and Congress could change the rules midway through the year  you might come out better or worse, depending on the nature of the rule changes... thats why I stress that its an estimate.

    "content": "I respectfully disagree with JohnFXs comment regarding new vs used. John knows what is talking about though he gave an awesome answer on buying a car What are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations? The answer to your question is based on whether or you not you can stand to have a small, loud, cheap but reliable car for the next 10 or 15 years. If you plan to keep your new car until it dies 20 years from now, then a new car can be a fine choice. I just bought a car and the difference between my 2013 Hyundai and a comparable 2012 Hyundai wasnt much. Furthermore, it was hard to even find a 2012 which justifies the higher price from dealerships and the private market. Doing math in my head told me the reduced usage I will get out of the car wasnt offset by the slightly lower price. Depending on the specific age, insurance on newer cars can be cheaper than insurance on older cars. But you have to have carry more insurance, so consider that as well. There might not be a different between a 2010 and a 2012, but there will likely be for a 2005 and the 2013. New cars can be cheaper to operate. Lower fuel costs, better safety and possibly pollution costs. They are tuned up and you know everything about their history. Repairs and factory warranties might not be available on a used car, so if you car turns out to be a problem, your out of pocket is limited. These programs dont mean anything. Get an independent certified mechanic to check out any used car you buy. If the dealer wont let you get the car checked out, then they arent worth your business. Certified cars dont justify their cost according to consumer reports, they are more for marketing than reliability. Dont waste money on a third party warranty. Either the car is good and doesnt need it, or it needs a warranty and you shouldnt buy it. If you new car comes with a factory warranty, that is fine. Radio host Clark Howard is indifferent if you want to purchase a factory warranty separately, but never a third party. Just out of college, you probably will be better off spending the least amount of money you can for a good used car. If for no other reason, this likely isnt going to be your car in the near future. Only you can answer that If you have a feeling you wont keep your tiny car well into your 30s, then definitely dont buy a new car. Also, my experience only applies to my make and model. Certain models of cars keep their value and the difference between new and used isnt much for the most recent model years. But there are many more makes and models that dont pan out that way."

I would say it would be cheaper to fly although I dont know if its true to the specific situation of the OP, but as I said  its too localized to deal with rather than drive from Texas to Colorado. If the OP thinks that driving a thousand miles is indeed ordinary and necessary hell have to justify it to the IRS examiner, as Im sure it will be examined. 2 trips to the property a year will be a nearly 100 writeoff 2000 miles, hotels, etc. From what I understood and that is what Ive been told by my CPA, IRS generally allows 1 one trip per year per property.

You cannot deduct personal \"pleasure\" expenses, at all. If the trip is mainly business, but you go out at the evening instead of staying at the hotel  thats fine. But if the trip is \"business\" trip where you spend a couple of hours at your property and then go around having fun for two days  the whole trip may be disallowed. If theres a reasonable portion dedicated to your businessrental, and the rest is pleasure  youll have to split some of the costs and only deduct the portion attributed to the business activities. Youll have to analyze your specific situation, and see where it falls. Dont stretch the limits too much, it will cost you more on the long run after all the audits and penalties. Can I also write off all travel involved in the purchase of the property? Although, again, the \"necessary and ordinary\" justification of such a trip is arguable, lets assume it is necessary and ordinary and generally justified. It is reasonable to expect you to go and see the property with your own eyes before the closing IMHO, of course, Im not an authority. Such an expense can be either business or investment expense. If its a business expense  its deductible on schedule C. If its an investment expense if you do buy the property, its added to the cost of the property capitalized.

    "topic": "What is a good rental yield?",
    "content": "A good quick filter to see if a property is worth looking at is if the total rent for the property for the year is equal to 10 of the price of the property. For example, if the property is valued at 400,000 then the rent collected should be 40,000 for the entire year. Which is 3,333.33 per month. If the property does not bring in at least 10 per year then it is not likely all the payments can be covered on the property. Its more likely to be sinking money into it to keep it afloat. You would be exactly right, as you have to figure in insurance, utilities, taxes, maintenancerepair, mortgage payments, new roof, new furnace, etc, drywall, paint, etc. Also as a good rule of thumb, expect a vacancy rate of at least 10 or 1 month per year as a precaution. If you have money sitting around, look into Real Estate Investment Trusts. IIRC, the average dividend was north of 10 last year. That is all money that comes back to you. Im not sure what the tax implications are in Australia, however in Canada dividends are taxed very favourably. No mortgage, property tax, tenants to find, or maintenance either."

    "topic": "How to read DOJI chart pattern correctly?",
    "content": "Candle stick patterns are generally an indication of possible short term changes in price direction if a reversal pattern. A doji is such a reversal candle, and should be read as there could be a short term change in the direction of price action. A doji is most effective at peaks or troughs, and the outcome can be a higher probability if occuring during overbought conditions at the peak or during oversold conditions at the trough. So a doji should be used for short term changes in direction and not a total change in the overall trend. Although there could be a doji at the very top of an uptrend or at the very bottom of a downtrend, we wouldnt know it was the change of the trend until price action confirms it. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs. So an uptrend will not be broken until we have a lower high and confirmed by a lower low, or a lower low confirmed by a lower high. Similarly a downtrend will not be broken until we have a higher low confirmed by a higher high or a higher high followed by a higher low. Another thing to consider is that dojis and other candle stick patters work best when the market is trending, even if they are only short term trends. You should usually wait for confirmation of the change in direction by only taking a long trade if price moves above the high of the doji, or only taking a short trade if price moves below the low of the doji."

Goggle saw the potential for the largest chunk of bandwidth available to the telcos to be restricted to services of one company and their strangle hold over the phones and services that were allowed to use it.

    "topic": "Are spot market ,regular market and ready market same in stock trading if not then what is the difference?",
    "content": "So, the term \"ready market\" simply means that a market exists in which there are legitimate buysell offers, meaning there are investors willing to own or trade in the security. A \"spot market\" means that the securitycommodity is being delivered immediately, rather at some predetermined date in the future hence the term \"futures market\". So if you buy oil on the spot market, youd better be prepared to take immediate delivery, where as when you buy a futures contract, the transaction doesnt happen until some later date. The advantage for futures contract sellers is the ability to lock in the price of what theyre selling as a hedge against the possibility of a price drop between now and when they canwill deliver the commodity. In other words, a farmer can presell his grain at a set price for some future delivery date so he can know what hes going to get regardless of the price of grain at the time he delivers it. The downside to the farmer is that if grain prices rise higher than what he sold them for as futures contracts then he loses that additional money. Thats the advantage to the buyer, who expects the price to rise so he can resell what he bought from the farmer at a profit. When you trade on margin, youre basically borrowing the money to make a trade, whether youre trading long buying or short selling on a security. It isnt uncommon for traders to pledge securities they already own as collateral for a margin account, and if they are unable to cover a margin call then those securities can be liquidated or confiscated to satisfy the debt. There still may even be a balance due after such a liquidation if the pledged securities dont cover the margin call. Most of the time you pay a fee or interest rate on whatever you borrow on margin, just like taking out a bank loan, so if youre going to trade on margin, you have to include those costs in your calculations as to what you need to earn from your investment to make a profit. When I short trade, Im selling something I dont own in the expectation I can buy it back later at a lower price and keep the difference. For instance, if I think Apple shares are going to take a steep drop at some point soon, I can short them. So imagine I shortsell 1000 shares of AAPL at the current price of 112. That means my brokerage account is credited with the proceeds of the sale 112,000, and I now owe my broker 1000 shares of AAPL stock. If the stock drops to 100 and I \"cover my short\" buy the shares back to repay the 1000 I borrowed then I pay 100,000 for them and give them to my broker. I keep the difference 12,000 between what I sold them for and what I paid to buy them back, minus any brokerage fees and fees the broker may charge me for shortselling. In conclusion, a margin trade is using someone elses money to make a trade, whether its to buy more or to sell short. A short trade is selling shares I dont even own because I think I can make money in the process. I hope this helps."

You may find it interesting to read up on the Elliot wave principle. The crash of 2008 was a perfect Elliot Wave fit. Elliot Wave theory states that social moods which ultimately drive the stock market generally occur in a relatively predictable pattern. The crash in September was a Wave 3 down. This is where the majority of people give up hope. However there are still a few people who are still holding on. The markets tend to meander about during wave 4. Finally the last few people give up hope and sell out. This causes the final crash of wave 5. Only when the last person has given up hope can the markets start to go up again.."

    "topic": "Why cant you just have someone invest for you and split the profits and losses with him?",
    "content": "Written with some mild snark , but no insult intended, because financial stuff can be ridiculously confusing... Looked at another way, youre basically asking if the Biblical \"Parable of the Talents\" can be implemented as a business model. You as the investor wish to be the \"master\", with the entity doing the investing playing the part of the \"servant\". Since the law prohibits actual servitude as described in scripture, the model must substitute a contractual profit and losssharing scheme. OK, based on what youve proposed, and by way of example, lets say you invested a thousand dollars. You give the investment service your money. At the end of a year, they give you back  Your capital 1000  Plus 12 of any profits OR  Less 12 of any losses So lets say the worst happens and they lose ALL of it. According to your proposal, they have to cover 12 of the loss. You end up with 500...but they end up with LESS than nothing. They will be in a deficit situation because all the expense was theirs. They dont just fail to make a profit. They go in the hole. It doesnt matter what percentages you use. Regardless of how the loss is shared, youve only guaranteed YOU cant lose all your money. The company CAN. Given a large enough investment, or enough market fluctuation, a big shared loss could shut down a smaller firm. To summarize  You want a service that charges you nothing  Does all the work of expertly managing and investing your capital  Takes on part of the risk you would normally bear  on top of their usual risk and liability  Agrees to do so solely for a percentage of any return where higher returns will likely involve a higher degree of risk  AND that guarantees, after just 1 year, youll get X of your capital back, no matter what. Win or lose.  Even if the market crashes and all your capital, and theirs, is wiped out Superbest, um, to be serious briefly what youre proposing is, if nothing else, inherently unfair and inequitable. I believe you intended it as a mutually beneficial scenario, but the realworld imbalance in risk and reward prevents it being so. Any financial service that would accept those terms along with the extra degree of risk would be fiscally irresponsible. From a business standpoint its an untenable model, and no company would build on it. It would be tantamount to corporate suicide. The requirement that a service promise to give you back X of your money, no matter how great the loss, makes your proposal impossible. You need to think about how much all this costs, realistically, as well what kind of returns you can actually expect. And that more risk for higher return is exactly what a service could NOT take a chance on if it had to \"share\" investors losses. Besides, its not really sharing, now is it? They will always lose more than you, always end up in a negative situation, unable even to recoup costs. Circumstances beyond their control could result in a drop in the value that not only wipes out any profit, but requires them to pay YOU for work performed and expenses incurred on your behalf. Why would they let anyon doubledip like that? Yeah, we all prefer getting something for nothing...but you want valuable services and for them to pay you money for the privilege of providing them? I totally agree that would be fantastic, but in this world even \"free\" doesnt come cheap anymore. And getting back to costs Without consistent income the service would have nowhere to work and no resources to work with. No office, computer, phone, electricity, Internet, insurance, payroll, licensing, training, maintenance, security, lobbying, etc., etc., etc. Why do people always forget overhead? Theres a reason these services operate the way they do. Even the best are working with fairly slim margins in a volatile sector. Theyre not into 1year gambles unlikely to cover their cost of doing business, or having to pay for a negative return out of their own pocket. Look, if youre the Biblical master asking your servant to manage things, overhead is builtin. Youre taking all the risk as well. Youre paying for all three servants food, home, clothing, etc, plus you had to buy the servants themselves. So its reasonable that you reap the reward of their labor. You paid for it, and you didnt even punish the servant who buried your money in a hole. The two good servants may have done the legwork, but you took on the burden of everything else. In your proposed service, however, contrary to the servants usual role, the servant  i.e., the company  would be assuming a portion of your risk on top of their own, yet without any guarantee of profit, income, or even coverage of costs. Theyre also subject to regulations, fees, liability, legal stuff, etc. that youre not, against most of which you are indemnified and held harmless. If they agree to cover a share of your loss, it exposes to greater liability and more related risk. It robs them of resources they need to invest in their own business, while at the same time forcing them to do all the work. As a result, your model doesnt give such a service a fighting chance. Getting it off the ground and lasting past the firstyear payouts would require more luck than skill. Theyd be better off heading to Vegas and the blackjack table, where the only overhead is a cheap flight and room, where the odds and rules dont change overnight, and they at least get free drinks. If none of the equivalents satisfies, then the Biblical parable appears to describe your only option for obtaining exactly what you want Move to a country where slavery is legal and buy an investor  Cheers, c"

    "topic": "Is Cost of Living overstated?",
    "content": "I do not believe there is a strong correlation between CPI Consumer Price Index and housing value appreciation. Take, for example, New York City which has the highest CPI in the US. A great deal of the CPI number is skewed by Manhattan. One can live in Brooklyn or Queens and avoid some of NYCs high CPI. I would say that housing appreciation occurs because of the human activity in the area. That same human activity is what drives the CPI. There are other contributing factors, like limits on economies of scale. You simply cannot set down a Super Walmart in much of NYC, so goods are distributed over a larger number of stores. Sure, NYC is a port city, but the goods are distributed within the city by trucks. The San Francisco Bay Area is another high CPI area in the US. Here, as well, it is the location that draws people. While NYC is mostly about economic activity, the SF Bay Area is a mix of the draw of a great location and the economic activity that occurs due to the large number of people living there. I know of a house in Oakland that sold for approximately 350k, in 200405. It was located not too far from the \"Killing Fields,\" as they were known locally. It was not the worst neighborhood in Oakland, but it was not very far from it. This was for a shabby, singlestory unit which I believe had 5 maybe 6 rooms. That is a lot of money for a house that required a lot of attention and was in a bad neighborhood. I have no idea how the housing market is after the housing bubble, but the higher value areas had the most room to fall and many of them fell hard. Ultimately, it is supply and demand that determines the CPI and housing values. This supply and demand is determined by the human activity in the area and some practical considerations regarding the area. A final note If we are talking about a primary residence, it should not necessarily be looked at as an investment. First and foremost, it is a necessity. Second, if you need to hire people for the maintenance andor upgrades, that will eat into your gains. Contractors are not cheap, especially where they are in high demand. Finally, the tax incentive is actually not that great. Sure, you take what you can get, but its impact is relatively marginal."

    "topic": "What benefits do title search companies have over physically visiting a land records offices?",
    "content": "Basically what littleadv said, but let me amplify what I think is the most important point. As heshe says, one thing youre paying them for is their expertise. If the title on record at the county office had a legal flaw in it, would you recognize it? In a way your question is like asking, Why should I go to a doctor when I could just make my own medicine out of herbs I grow in my garden and treat myself? Maybe you could. But the doctor and the pharmacist have years of training on how to do this right. You probably dont. Is it possible for you to learn everything you need to do it right? Sure. But do you want to spend the time to study all that for something that you will do  buy a house  maybe once every ten years? Will you remember it all next time or have to learn it all over? But really most important is, title companies offer insurance in case the title turns out to be flawed. That, to me, is the big reason why I would use a title company even if I was paying cash and there was no bank involved to insist on it. If theres some legal flaw in the title and it turns out that someone else has a claim to my house, and I lose in court, I would be out about 100,000. Your house might be costing you much more. Thats a huge risk to take. Paying the couple of hundred dollars for insurance against that risk seems well worth it to me. And by the way, I dont think the \"due diligence\" is easy. Its NOT just a matter of making sure a title is really on file at the court house and has the proper stamp on it. Its all about, Does someone else have a legal claim to this property? Like, maybe three owners ago someone forged a signature on a deed, so the sale is fraudulent, and now the person who was defrauded or his heirs discover the issue and claim the property. Or maybe the previous owner failed to pay a contractor who did repairs on the house, and now he goes to court and gets a lien on the property. Its unlikely that you have the expertise to recognize a forged document. You almost surely have no way to recognize a forged signature of someone you never met on an otherwise validlooking document. And youd have to do a lot of research to find every contractor who ever worked on the house and insure none of them have a claim. Etc."

    "topic": "What are the implications of a corporate stock repurchase or share buyback program?",
    "content": "A stock buy back reduces the number of stocks available on the open market. Since stocks are literally a share in ownership a buy back of the stock then when the company repurchases it has the effect of increasing the percent of ownership of the company of each stock. Zynga has a Market Cap of 1810M so a 200M buy back will increase the ownership value of each stock by 12. This has had the effect of an immediate stock price bump of around 12 which is to be expected as the value becomes the expected post buyback value. However long term gains will require Zynga to turn around their business. This bump will only be sustainable if they can. If their business continues to decline then its stock price will continue to slide. There are some who would rather see Zynga invest that 200m in getting a new product to market to bring revenues up rather than spending precious capital on a plan to temporarily bump a stock that is headed towards the floor. If on the other hand the revenue is poised to recover and the company has the excess capitol buying back stock low is a great way to get the most back for your shareholders bucks. Can they repurchase at any price and any time? They can write a buy order for any price at any time in the future, though they have some restrictions from the SEC mostly involving disclosures. But it is up to the sellers to choose to sell at that price. If they execute the buy back at a rate comparable to market rate then they are more likely to get takers than if they attempt to buy it back at a significant reduction from market price. So since today10252012 the it is selling for 2.30 A buy order for 2.30 is going to get more action than one at 2.00. Investors will often look at the companies buy back offer for a company in declinelike Zynga has been as the true value of the company. If so then a lowball buyback offer could add downward pressure on the stock price."

All deposits. Note, I recently read a QA here describing such an offer. If I see it again, Ill link. Let the thought of the above settle in. You think about the fact that 42K isnt a bad salary, and decide to deposit 30, to gain the full match on your 18K deposit. Now, you budget to live your life, pay your bills, etc, but its tight. When you accumulate 2000, and a strong want comes up a toy, a trip, anything, no judgement you have a tough decision. You think to yourself, \"after the match, I am literally saving 45 of my income. Im on a pace to have the ability to retire in 20 years. Why do I need to save even more?\" Your budget has enough discretionary spending that if you have a 2000 emergency, you charge it and pay it off over the next 68 months. Much larger, and you know that your superfunded 401k has the ability to tap a loan. Your choice to turn away from the common wisdom has the recommended 20K about 6 months of your spending sitting in your 401k, pretax deposited as 26K, and matched to nearly 40K, growing long term. Note This is a devils advocate answer. Had I been the first to answer, it would reflect the above. In my own experience, when I got married, we built up the proper emergency fund. As interest rates fell, we looked at our mortgage balance, and agreed that paying down the loan would enable us to refinance and save enough in mortgage interest that the net effect was as if we were getting 8 on the money. At the same time as we got that new mortgage, the bank offered a HELOC, which I never needed to use. Did we somehow create high risk? Perhaps. Given that my wife and I were both still working, and had similar incomes, it seemed reasonable."

    "topic": "What exactly can a financial advisor do for me, and is it worth the money?",
    "content": "A financial planner can help with investments, insurance, estate planning, budgeting, retirement planning, saving for college, tax planningprep, and other money topics. One way to get a sense is to look at this Certified Financial Planner topic list. Another idea is to look at this book my favorite Ive read which covers roughly a similar topic list in a concise form httpwww.amazon.comSmartSimpleFinancialStrategiesPeopledp0743269942 It could not hurt at all to read that before deciding to visit a planner, so you have baseline knowledge. By the way, look for the CFP certification which is a generalist certification. A CFP might also have a deeper cert in certain topics or connect you with someone who does. For example You really want a generalist CFP who may have an additional credential as well. The idea is to holistically look at what youre trying to accomplish and all financerelated areas. Especially because there may be tradeoffs. The CFP would then refer you to or work with lawyers, accountants, etc. Importantly, some advisors are fiduciaries must act in your interests and some are not. In particular many stockbrokers are neither qualified planners no CFP or equivalent nor are they fiduciaries. Stay away. There are several models for paying a financial planner, including Theres an organization called NAPFA napfa.org for fiduciary noncommissionbased planners. Membership there is a good thing to look for since its a third party that defines what feeonly means and requires the nocommissionsfiduciary standard. Finally, the alternative I ended up choosing was to just take the CFP course myself. You can do it online via correspondence course, it costs about the same as 1 year of professional advice. I also took the exam, just to be sure I learned the stuff. This is the \"extreme DIY\" approach but it is cheaper over time and you know you are not going to defraud yourself. You still might do things that are counterproductive and not in your interests, but you know that already probably  Anyway I think its equivalent to about a quarters worth of work at a decent college, or so. There are about 6 textbooks to dig through. You wont be an experienced expert at the end, but youll know a lot. To get an actual CFP cert, you need 3 years experience on top of the courses and the exam  I havent done that, just the book learning. Someone who puts \"CFP\" after their name will have the 3 years on top of the training. Some editorial many planners emphasize investing, and many people looking for planners or books on finance emphasize investing. This is a big mistake, in my view. Investing is more or less a commodity and you just need someone who wont screw it up, overcharge, andor lose your money on something idiotic or inappropriate. Some people are in plainbad and inappropriate investments, dont get me wrong. But once you fix that and just get into anything decent, your biggest planning concerns are probably elsewhere. On investments, Id look for a planner to just get you out of overpriced annuities and expensive mutual funds you may have been sold anything you were sold by a salesperson is probably crap. And look for them to help you decide how much to invest, and how much in stocks vs. bonds. Those are the most important investment decisions."

    "content": "When stocks have a change in price it is because of a TRADE. To have a trade you have to have both a buyer and a seller. When the price of a security is going up there are an equal amount of shares being sold as being bought. When the price of a security is going down there are an equal amount of shares being bought as being sold. There almost always is an unequal amount of shares waiting to be sold compared to the amount waiting to be bought. But waiting shares do not move the price, only when the purchase price and the sale price agree, and a trade occurs, does the price move. So the price does not go down because more shares are being sold. Neither does the price go up because more shares are being bought."

    "content": "The answers youll receive are going to be largely subjective. I cant tell you which option would be best for you, but there are plenty of things to consider. Do you know how to sell a home? If your market is hot enough, FSBO may make sense as you wont need the marketing power and expertise of an agent. In very hot markets, youll end up with potential bidding wars if you price your house correctly. But thats where things start getting tricky. Do you know what your house is realistically worth in your market, or are you making assumptions based on Zillow or similar? Do you know what paper work is needed to complete a FSBO sale? Are you any good at negotiating? There are certainly plenty of resources out there for FSBO sellers to learn how to do it, but it can be overwhelming. FSBO isnt really fee free. If the buyer has an agent, theyll want a percentage 3 for setting up their part of the sale. Without experience in negotiation, you may be leaving a decent amount of money on the table. Also, in negotiations, an experienced agent may nickel  dime you with contingencies all the way up until closing. Then theres anything you might need to pay for marketing materials and time off from work if needed to have the house shown. However, if youre in a market where people are literally walking up to your door to ask if youd consider selling and for how much which just happened to a friend of mine, then it might actually be a pretty painless process. Traditional agents charge a fee, but that fee goes towards marketing and their experience in sales and negotiations. They do the work of getting your property in front of the right people and setting up house showings. The work is done on your behalf, and you wont need to alter your personal work schedule anywhere near as much as you would with FSBO. They only get paid if the house sells. Limited service agents are a bit of an unknown to me, but its more than likely the buyer will have an agent, so assume the higher fee. It also appears that the LSA gets paid at least 500 no matter what happens, so theyre certainly not putting in any extra effort to help get your house sold. It appears that youre simply paying to get on their list of homes and get some marketing from them, but thats about it. Id imagine you could get the same exposure as a well educated FSBO seller."

A high level choice of investment one makes is between equity such as stock and debt investments such as bonds and mortgages. You are in a unique case of being able to invest in your own mortgage with no investment fee. This may tip the scales in favor of paying down the mortgage. It is difficult to answer in your specific case as we dont know the rest of your finances. Do you have a sizable 401K that is heavily invested in stocks? Do you have the need for a college fund? Do you have an emergency fund? Do you have a desire to own several homes generating income property? If it was me Id do the following in order, skipping steps I may have already completed Ive heard that the bank may agree to a \"one time adjustment\" to lower the payments on Mortgage 2 because of paying a very large payment. Is this something that really happens? I really kind of hate this attitude. Your goal is to get rid of the mortgage in a timely manner.

This later fact, to me, is a great predictor of financial success. Reading into the financial data surrounding student loans, it pretty easy to see that this demographic makes poor money decisions. I live near a state university. A large percentage of students drive late model luxury cars, frequent expensive bars and restaurants, and wear pretty nice clothes. They also graduate with, on average 60K in student loans. Keep in mind a 4 year degree could be had for about 30K and could be paid for working a part time job.

You can arrange things so you have a significant chance of making a small profit, but at the risk of a large downside. If you havent firmly decided exactly how much downside you are willing to accept, its very easy to simultaneously believe you dont have much money at risk, but that youll be able to win back anything you lose. The only way you can hope to win back anything you lose is by bringing a lot more money to the table, which will of course greatly increase your downside risk. The probability of making money for the person willing to accept 15 of downside risk to earn 1 is about 93. The probability of making money for the person willing to accept 255 worth of risk is about 99.5.

    "content": "This is largely a cultural issue. I would be appalled at the very idea that my parents would charge me interest for lending me money. Just as they would be appalled if I were to do so if lending them money. I find the idea of attempting to make money off of your children fundamentally wrong. I realize that you only want to do this to teach them, that you have their best interests in mind and not your own profit. Nevertheless, what will actually happen were you to charge them interest is that you would accrue a monetary gain at the expense of your children. Is that really something you would be comfortable with? Now, as I stated at the beginning, this is clearly a cultural issue. Based on the other answers here, many cultures, probably including your own, find nothing wrong with this. Ive even heard of people charging their adult children rent when they come home for the holidays, something that is completely baffling to me. The point I am trying to make is that asking other peoples opinions on whether you should do this is not very useful unless those people share your own cultural background. My family and culture are such that the idea of charging interest to ones family members seems downright immoral to me. Given that you are asking here, it seems like you might be on the fence about it yourself. However, I freely admit that my answer is colored by my own cultural prejudices and may very well not be applicable to you. Still, ask yourself, is a relatively small amount of money in the grand scheme of thingsor, for that matter, an entire fortuneworth jeopardizing your relationship with your children? Do you really believe that having their parents retroactively charge them interest for a loan will somehow teach them something about the \"real world\" that your already adult children dont know? One of the main reasons they came to you and didnt go to a bank is precisely that they expected the loan to be interest free. So, sure, tell them that you wont lend any more until they repay what they owe. Even better, sit them down and have an honest, adult conversation, explaining that the absence of the money they owe is making itself felt in your household and work out a way they can repay you. What, in my opinion, you most certainly shouldnt do is treat your relationship with your children as a regular business transaction. It isnt and I am sure you dont want it to be."

You also want at least 2 years credit history, so closing an older credit card may shorten your credit history, again lowering your credit score. You want to keep around at least 12 older cards, even if they are not the best. You have 4 cards But having 24 cards you have 4 means you can add a 5th, and then cancel one down to 4, or cancel one down to 3 and then add a 4th, for little net effect. Still, there will be effect, as you have decreased the age of your credit, and you have opened new credit always a ding to your score. Do you have installment loans cars, you mention a new mortgage, so you need to wait about 3 months after the most recent credit activity to let the effects of that change settle. You want both spouses to have separate credit cards, and that will increase the total available to 48. That would allow you to increase the number of benefits available."

    "content": "There is no simple answer to your question. It depends on many things, perhaps most notably what college your daughter ends up going to and what kind of aid you hope to receive. Your daughter will probably fill out the FAFSA as part of her financial aid application. Here is one discussion of what parental assets \"count\" towards the Expected Family Contribution on the FAFSA. You can find many similar pages by googling. Retirement accounts and primary residence are notable categories that do not count. So, if you were looking to reduce your \"apparent\" assets for aid purposes, dumping money into your mortgage or retirement account is a possibility. However, you should be cautious when doing this type of gaming, because its not always clear exactly how it will affect financial aid. For one thing, \"financial aid\" includes both grants and loans. Everyone wants grants, but sometimes increasing your \"eligibility\" may just make you or your daughter eligible for larger loans, which may not be so great. Also, each college has its own system for allocating financial aid. Individual schools may ask for more detailed information such as the CSS Profile. So strategies for minimizing your apparent assets that work for one school may not work for others. Some elite schools with large endowments have generous aid policies that allow even families with sizable incomes to pay little or nothing e.g., Stanford waives tuition for most families with incomes under 125,000. You should probably research the financial aid policies of schools your daughter is interested in. It can be helpful to talk to financial aid advisors at colleges, as well as high school counselors, not to mention general financial advisors if you really want to start getting technical about what assets to move around. Needless to say, it all begins with talking with your daughter about her thoughts on where to go."

    "content": "A bank or credit card agency can deny your application for pretty much any reason. That said, its extremely unlikely theyd do so for a secured credit card. This is because the credit is secured. If your sister is to get a card with, say, a 1000 limit, she will have to provide 1000 in security. This means the banks risk practically nothing. That said, I have found one reference that claims you need a score of above 600 to qualify for a secured credit card, though this is hard to believe. Secured credit cards are a reasonable way of building your credit back up. Just about the only other way for her credit rating to improve is for her history of bad debt to fall off the credit report, but thats going to take quite some time. She should be working hard to provide positive credit history to replace the old negative history, assuming her credit rating is important to her. It may not be its only important if she plans on taking on debt in the future. Honestly, a credit rating of around 500 is so bad that I wouldnt even worry much about lowering it. Its already low enough as to make it all but impossible to qualify for unsecured credit or loans. A single denial is unlikely to significantly affect the score, except in the very short term. With two bankruptcies, I encourage credit counselling for your sister. There are a number of good books available, too. Credit counselling should go into detail on credit scores, unsecured credit, proper budgeting, and all that sort of useful information."

The challenge is, there are firms that make computers read filings for them and inform their trading strategy. If the computer thinks the stock price is below the growth model, its likely to bid the stock up. And since its automated its moving it faster than you can open your web browser. Does this mean you shouldnt read them? In a sense, no. The only sensible trading strategy is to assume you hold things for as long as their fundamentals exceed market value. Financial statements are where you find those fundamentals. So you should read them. But your question is, is it worth it for investors? My answer is no the market generally factors information in quickly and efficiently. Youre better off sticking to passive mutual funds than trying to trade. The better reason to learn to read these filings is to get a better sense of your employer, potential employers, competitors and even suppliers. Knowing what your margins are, what your suppliers margins and acquisitions are, and what theyre planning can inform your own decision making."

    "content": "Your credit score is really bad, and its highly unlikely anyone will be willing to give you a mortgage, especially if you still have bad debt showing up on your credit report. What would help? Well, clearing off any bad debt would be a good place to start. Ideally, you want to get your credit rating up above 680, though that may be optimistic here. Note, though, that bad debt falls off your credit report after a while. Exactly how long depends on your province. Note that making partial payment, or even just acknowledging the debt, will reset the timer, however. I mention this, though, because you mention some of your debt is from 5 or 6 years ago. It may be just about to fall off. It would also help if you can show that your credit is so bad because of mistakes from a number of years ago, but youve been making payments and staying on top of all debts for the past few years, if thats the case. Also, it would help if you had a reasonable downpayment. 20 minimum, but youll be a lower credit risk if you are able to put down 50  75. You could also consider having someone with good credit cosign the mortgage. Note that most people will not be willing to do this, as they take on substantial financial risk. All that said, there are some institutions which specialise in dealing with no credit or bad credit customers. You pay more fees and will pay a vastly higher interest rate, but this may be a good option for you. Check out mortgage brokers specialising in highrisk clients. You can also consider a renttoown, but almost all the advice Ive ever seen say to avoid these if you can. One late payment and you may lose all the equity you think youve been building up. Note that things may be different if you are moving from the U.S. to Canada, and have no credit history in Canada. In that case, you may have no credit rather than bad credit. Most banks still wont offer you a mortgage in this case, but some lenders do target recent immigrants. Dont rule out renting. For many people, regardless of their credit rating, renting is a better option.

    "content": "The other two answers seem basically correct, but I wanted to add on thing While you can exercise an \"American style\" option at any time, its almost never smart to do so before expiration. In your example, when the underlying stock reaches 110, you can theoretically make 2share by exercising your option buying 100 shares  108share and immediately selling those 100 shares back to the market at 110share. This is all before commission. In more detail, youll have these practical issues You are going to have to pay commissions, which means youll need a bigger spread to make this worthwhile. You and those who have already answered have you finger on this part, but I include it for completeness. Even at expiration, if the difference between the last close price and the strike price is pretty close, some \"inthemoney\" options will be allowed to expire unexercised when the holders cant cover the closing commission costs. The market value of the option contract itself should also go up as the price of the underlying stock goes up. Unless its very close to expiration, the option contract should have some \"time value\" in its market price, so, if you want to close your position at this point, earlier then expiration, it will probably be better for you to sell the contract back to the market for more money and only one commission than to exercise and then close the stock position for less money and two commissions. If you want to exercise and then flip the stock back as your exit strategy, you need to be aware of the settlement times. You probably are not going to instantly have those 100 shares of stock credited to your account, so you may not be able to sell them right away, which could leave you subject to some risk of the price changing. Alternatively, you could sell the stock short to lock in the price, but youll have to be sure that your brokerage account is set up to allow that and understand how to do this."

You get back on average 1.5 for every dollar you bet, so every dollar you dont bet is a 0.5 loss. But if you do this and you play every day for 10 years, youll almost always end up bankrupt. Funny that. On the other hand, if you bet nothing, you are losing out on a great investment. So under certain assumptions, you neither want to bet everything, nor do you want to bet nothing assuming you can repeat the bet almost indefinitely. The question then becomes, what percentage of your bankroll should you bet? Kelly Criterion answers this question. The typical Kelly Criterion case is where we are making a bet with positive returns, not an insurance against loss but with a bit of mathematical trickery, we can use it to determine how much you should spend on insuring against loss. An \"easy\" way to undertand the Kelly Criterion is that you want to maximize the logarithm of your worth in a given period. Such a maximization results in the largest longterm value in some sense. Let us give it a try in an insurance case. Suppose you have a 1 million dollar asset. It has a 1 chance per year of being destroyed by some random event flood, fire, taxes, pitchforks. You can buy insurance against this for 2 of its value per year. It even covers pitchforks. On its face this looks like a bad deal. Your expected loss is only 1, but the cost to hide the loss is 2? If this is your only asset, then the loss makes your net worth 0. The log of zero is negative infinity. Under Kelly, any insurance no matter how inefficient is worth it. This is a bit of an extreme case, and well cover why it doesnt apply even when it seems like it does elsewhere. Now suppose you have 1 million dollars in other assets. In the insured case, we always end the year with 1.98 million dollars, regardless of if the disaster happens. In the noninsured case, 99 of the time we have 2 million dollars, and 1 of the time we have 1 million dollars. We want to maximize the expected log value of our worth. We have log2 million  20,000 the insured case vs 1  log1 million  99  log2 million. Or 13.7953 vs 14.49. The Kelly Criterion says insurance is worth it note that you could \"afford\" to replace your home, but because it makes up so much of your net worth, Kelly says the \"hit it too painful\" and you should just pay for insurance. Now suppose you are worth 1 billion. We have log1 billion  20k on the insured side, and 1log999 million  99  log1 billion on the uninsured side. The logs of each side are 21.42 vs 20.72. Note that the base of the logarithm doesnt matter so long as you use the same base on each side. According to Kelly, we have found a case where insurance isnt worth it. The Kelly Criterion roughly tells you \"if I took this bet every period of time, would I be on average richer after many repeats of this bet than if I didnt take this bet?\" When the answer is \"no\", it implies selfinsurance is more efficient than using external insurance. The answer is going to be sensitive to the profit margin of the insurance product you are buying, and the size of the asset relative to your total wealth. Now, the Kelly Criterion can easily be misapplied. Being worth financially zero in current assets can easily ignore nonfinancial assets like your ability to work, or friends, or whatever. And it presumes repeat to infinity, and people tend not to live that long. But it is a good starting spot. Note that the option of bankruptcy can easily make insurance not \"worth it\" for people far poorer this is one of the reasons why banks insist you have insurance on your proprety. You can use Kelly to calculate how much insurance you should purchase at a given profit margin for the insurance company given your net worth and the risk involved. This can be used in Finance to work out how much you should hedge your bets in an investment as well in effect, it quantifies how having money makes it easier to make money."

    "topic": "Why is the dominant investing advice for individuals to use mutual funds, exchanged traded funds ETFs, etc",
    "content": "Great question! While investing in individual stocks can be very useful as a learning experience, my opinion is that concentrating an entire portfolio in a few companies stock is a mistake for most investors, and especially for a novice for several reasons. After all, only a handful of professional investors have ever beaten the market over the long term by picking stocks, so is it really worth trying? If you could, Id say go work on Wall Street and good luck to you. Diversification For many investors, diversification is an important reason to use an ETF or index fund. If they were to focus on a few sectors or companies, it is more likely that they would have a lopsided risk profile and might be subject to a larger downside risk potential than the market as a whole, i.e. \"dont put all your eggs in one basket\". Diversification is important because of the nature of compound investing  if you take a significant hit, it will take you a long time to recover because all of your future gains are building off of a smaller base. This is one reason that younger investors often take a larger position in equities, as they have longer to recover from significant market declines. While it is very possible to build a balanced, diversified portfolio from individual stocks, this isnt something Id recommend for a new investor and would require a substantial collegelevel understanding of investments, and in any case, this portfolio would have a more discrete efficient frontier than the market as a whole. Lower Volatility Picking individual stocks or sectors would could also significantly increase or decrease the overall volatility of the portfolio relative to the market, especially if the stocks are highly cyclical or correlated to the same market factors. So if they are buying tech stocks, they might see bigger upswings and downswings compared to the market as a whole, or see the opposite effect in the case of utilities. In other words, owning a basket of individual stocks may result in an unintended volatilitybeta profile. Lower Trading Costs and Taxes Investors who buy individual stocks tend to trade more in an attempt to beat the market. After accounting for commission fees, transaction costs bidask spread, and taxes, most individual investors get only a fraction of the market average return. One famous academic study finds that investors who trade more trail the stock market more. Trading also tends to incur higher taxes since short term gains 1 year are taxed at marginal income tax rates that are higher than long term capital gains. Investors tend to trade due to behavioral failures such as trying to time the market, being overconfident, speculating on stocks instead of longterm investing, following what everyone else is doing, and getting in and out of the market as a result of an emotional reaction to volatility ie buying when stocks are highrising and selling when they are lowfalling. Investing in index funds can involve minimal fees and discourages behavior that causes investors to incur excessive trading costs. This can make a big difference over the long run as extra costs and taxes compound significantly over time. Its Hard to Beat the Market since Markets are Quite Efficient Another reason to use funds is that it is reasonable to assume that at any point in time, the market does a fairly good job of pricing securities based on all known information. In other words, if a given stock is trading at a low PE relative to the market, the market as a whole has decided that there is good reason for this valuation. This idea is based on the assumption that there are already so many professional analysts and traders looking for arbitrage opportunities that few such opportunities exist, and where they do exist, persist for only a short time. If you accept this theory generally obviously, the market is not perfect, there is very little in the way of insight on pricing that the average novice investor could provide given limited knowledge of the markets and only a few hours of research. It might be more likely that opportunities identified by the novice would reflect omissions of relevant information. Trying to make money in this way then becomes a bet that other informed, professional investors are wrong and you are right options traders, for example. Prices are Unpredictable Behave Like \"Random\" Walks If you want to make money as a longterm investorowner rather than a speculatortrader, than most of the future change in asset prices will be a result of future events and information that is not yet known. Since no one knows how the world will change or who will be tomorrows winners or losers, much less in 30 years, this is sometimes referred to as a \"random walk.\" You can point to fundamental analysis and say \"X company has great free cash flow, so I will invest in them\", but ultimately, the problem with this type of analysis is that everyone else has already done it too. For example, Warren Buffett famously already knows the price at which hed buy every company hes interested in buying. When everyone else can do the same analysis as you, the price already reflects the markets take on that public information Efficent Market theory, and what is left is the unknown I wouldnt use the term \"random\". Overall, I think there is simply a very large potential for an individual investor to make a few mistakes with individual stocks over 20 years that will really cost a lot, and I think most investors want a balance of risk and return versus the largest possible return, and dont have an interest in developing a professional knowledge of stocks. I think a better strategy for most investors is to share in the future profits of companies buy holding a welldiversified portfolio for the long term and to avoid making a large number of decisions about which stocks to own."

First, you should not be forced to buy a home because your parents are telling you to. You should have your own life. Period. That said, while you are doing well from a salary perspective, your savings are somewhat borderline for a purchase if you ask me. Meaning your savings would essentially be the full downpayment  then your whole paycheck basically becomes payments on the mortgage. Not a good situation to be in. My advice would be that if you can invest in something smallerlike a small apartment for yourselfthat is what you should purchase. That would allow you to invest in something but not be completely financially drained by the prospect. And then in a few years, you can sell that apartment  move onto something else. Perhaps a house at that stage? But right now, a full home purchase would be a fairly massive risk."

Saving for, and purchasing a home essentially freezes rent increases. If home prices double in your area, in theory, so should rent prices. If you own a home you might see some increases in taxes and insurance rates, but they are minor in comparison. This also reduces the need for future income. Owning real estate is a great way to build residual income, however, there is a lot of risk and even if you employ a management company there is a lot more hands on work and risk. Easier then that you can build an after tax investment portfolio. You can start off with mutual funds for diversification purposes and only after you have built a sizable portfolio should if ever make the transition to individual stocks. Some people might suggest DRIPs, but given the rate at which you are investing I would suggest the pain of such accounts is more hassle then it is worth."

For example, suppose you are in the 28 tax bracket. Every marginal dollar you contribute to the Traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by .28 cents. However, when withdrawing, the first 10,150 of income is taxfree from standard deduction and exemption, 2014 numbers 20,300 for married couples, joint filing. The next dollars are at the 10 tax bracket, and so on. This is an advantage for the Traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing, a reasonable assumption. Avoid High State Income Tax. There are many states that have low or no state income tax. If you live in a state with a high income tax, paying tax now through the Roth 401k reduces the benefit of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate. Avoid triggering credit phaseouts. Many tax credits e.g. student loan interest, child tax credit, Hope credit, Roth IRA eligibility, etc. begin phasing out as your income increases. Contributing to the Traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits when you starting running up against those limits. As described in the article, if these items dont apply, contributing to the Roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification."

    "topic": "Variations of Dual momentum",
    "content": "Theres a few layers to the Momentum Theory discussed in that book. But speaking in general terms I can answer the following Kind of. Assuming you understand that historically the Nasdaq has seen a little more volatility than the SP. And, more importantly, that it tends to track the tech sector more than the general economy. Thus the pitfall is that it is heavily weighted towards and often tracks the performance of a few stocks including Apple, Google Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and Amgen. It could be argued this is counter intuitive to the general strategy you are trying to employ. This could be tougher to justify. The reason it is potentially not a great idea has less to do with the fact that gold has factors other than just risk onoff and inflation that affect its price even though it does! but more to do with the fact that it is harder to own gold and move in and out of positions efficiently than it is a bond index fund. For example, consider buying physical gold. To do so you have to spend some time evaluating the purchase, you are usually paying a slight premium above the spot price to purchase it, and you should usually also have some form of security or insurance for it. So, it has additional costs. Possibly worth it as part of a longterm investment strategy if you believe gold will appreciate over a decade. But not so much if you are holding it for as little as a few weeks and constantly moving in and out of the position over the year. The same is true to some extent of investing in gold in the form of an ETF. At least a portion of \"their gold\" comes from paper or futures contracts which must be rolled every month. This creates a slight inefficiency. While possibly not a deal breaker, it would not be as attractive to someone trading on momentum versus fundamentals in my opinion. In the end though, I think all strategies are adaptable. And if you feel gold will be the big mover this year, and want to use it as your risk hedge, who am I or anyone else to tell you that you shouldnt."

The extra returns on 100 stocks vs. 60 are 1.2 per year historically according to httpspersonal.vanguard.comusinsightssavinginvestingmodelportfolioallocations To get those average higher stock returns, you need to be thinking 2030 years even 10 years is too shortterm. Over the 2030 years, you must never panic and go to cash, or you will destroy the higher returns. You must never get discouraged and stop saving, or you will destroy the higher returns. You have to avoid the panic and discouragement despite the likelihood that some 10year period in your 2030 years the stock market will go nowhere. You also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early. If you look at \"dry periods\" in stocks, like 2000 to 2011, a 6040 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere. A diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money due to rebalancing while a 100 stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit. Its somewhat possible, probably, to predict dry periods in stocks if I remember the statistics, about 50 of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation normalized  adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins. Some funds such as httphussmanfunds.com are completely based on this, though a lot of money managers consider it. With a balanced portfolio and rebalancing, though, you dont have to worry about it very much. In my view, the proper goal is not to beat the market, nor match the market, nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns. Instead, the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your nonfinancial goals such as retirement, or buying a house. To maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions, predictability is more important than maximized returns. Your results are primarily determined by your savings rate  which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if its too low. You can certainly make a 40year projection in which 1.2 difference in returns makes a big difference. But you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life, where you could have emergency or emotional factors, where the market will move erratically and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time end of the 40 years, and so on. If your plan \"relies\" on the extra 1.2 returns then its not a reasonable plan anyhow, in my opinion, since you cant count on them. So why suffer the stress and extra risk created by an allstocks portfolio?"

Depending on the size of their operation, they may have considerable overhead costs that they need to recoup one way or another to continue operating profitably, they hope. Traditionally, banks would encourage you to save with them by offering interest growth on your deposits. Meanwhile they would invest your and all of their customers funds in securities or loans to other patrons that they anticipate will generate income for them at a faster rate than the interest they pay back to you. These days however, this overly simplified model is relatively insignificant in consumer banking. Instead, theyve found they can make a lot more profit by simply charging fees for the handling of your funds, and when they want to loan money to consumers they just borrow from a central bank. What this means is that the size of your balance unless abnormally huge is of little interest to a branch manager  it doesnt generate revenue for them much faster than a tiny balance with the same number of transactions would. To put it simply, they can live without you, and your threatening to leave, even if you follow through, is barely going to do anything to their bottom line. They will let you. If you DO have an abnormally huge balance, and its all in a simple checking or savings account, then it might make them pause for thought.

The value of the gift at the time of the giftgiving is used to determine the tax, and an exclusion of 14000 per person per year as of 2013 is available to allow smaller gifts to be given without too much of a red tape. Theres also a lifetime exemption which is shared between the gift tax and the estate tax. This exemption is 5.25M in 2013. The reason the gift tax exists in the US is because the US tax code is very aggressive. This is basically double taxation, similarly to estate tax. Giftsestates are aftertax money, i.e. income tax has been paid on them, yet the government taxes them again. Why? The excuse is to disallow shifting of income if one person has high income tax brackets, he may give some of his incomeproducing property to another person with lesser brackets who would then pay less income taxes for example, parents would transfer property to children. Similarly capital gains could be shifted. Generationskipping tax is yet another complication to disallow people use gifts to avoid estate taxes a grandparent would gift stuff to grandchildren, thus skipping a level of estate taxes the parents in between. In other countries the tax codes may be less aggressive, and not tax giftsinheritance as this money has been taxed before. This is a more fair situation, IMHO, yet it means that wealth moves from generation to generation without the \"general public\" benefiting from it. So if youre a US person and considering giving or receiving a gift  you need to consult with a tax adviser about the consequences. Similarly with other countries, if you are subject to their tax laws."

Update  The only major issuer I will say that it might be possible is Discover, because I never kept a Discover card. I also dont keep department store cards, which might possibly do this but I do doubt it in either of those cases too. My answer is based on Having 2 AMEX cards Optima and Blue and multiple other VisaMCs that I NEVER use... and most of these I have not for over 10 years. Since I am also presuming that you are also not talking about an account that charges a yearly or other maintenance fee.. Why would they keep the account open with the overhead statements and other mailings,etc? Because you MIGHT use it. You MIGHT not be able to pay it off each month. Because you MIGHT end up paying thousands in interest over many years. The pennies they pay for maintaining your account and sending you new cards with chip technology, etc.. are all worth the gamble of getting recouped from you! This is why sales people waste their time with lots of people who will not buy their product, even though it costs them time and money to prospect.. because they MIGHT buy. Naturally, there are a multitude of reasons for canceling a card but inactivity is not one. I have no less than 10 \"inactive\" cards, one that has a balance, and two I use \"infrequently\". I really would not mind if they closed all those accounts.. but they wont  So enjoy your AMEX knowing that your Visa will be there when you needwant it..

However, we can describe valuations In short, valuations are randomly distributed in a logVariance Gamma fashion with some reason  nonsense mixed in. You can check for yourself on finviz. You can basically download the entire US market and then some, with many financial and technical characteristics all in one spreadsheet. Re Fisher He was tied for the best monetary economist of the 20th century and created the best price index, but as for stocks, he said this famous quote 12 days before the 1929 crash \"Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau. I do not feel there will be soon if ever a 50 or 60 point break from present levels, such as bears have predicted. I expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months.\"  Irving Fisher, Ph.D. in economics, Oct. 17, 1929 EDIT Value investing has almost always been ignored by academia. Irving Fisher and other proponents of it before it was codified by Graham in the mid 20th century certainly didnt help with comments like the above. It was almost always believed that it was a suckers game, \"the bigger sucker\" game to be more precise because value investors get destroyed during recessioncollapses. So even though a recessionless economy would allow value investors and everyone never to suffer spontaneous collapses, value investors are looked down upon by academia because of the inevitable yet nearly always transitory collapse. This expresses that sentiment perfectly. It didnt help that Benjamin Graham didnt care about money so never reached the heights of Buffett who frequently alternates with Bill Gates as the richest person on the planet. Buffett has given much credibility, and academia finally caught on around in 2000 or so after he was proven right about a pending tech collapse that nearly no one believed would happen at least, thats where I begin seeing papers being published delving into value concepts. If one looks harder, academias even taken the torch and discovered some very useful tools. Yes, investment firms and fellow value investors kept up the information publishing, but they are not academics. The days of professors throwing darts at the stock listings and beating active managers despite most active managers losing to the market anyways really held back this side of academia until Buffett entered the fray and embarrassed them all with his clubs performance, culminating in the Superinvestors article which is still relatively ignored. Before that, it was the obsession with beta, the ratio of a securitys variance to its covariance to the market, a now abandoned theory because it has been utterly discredited the popularizers of beta have humorously embraced the PB, not giving the satisfaction to Buffet by spurning the PE. Tiny technology firms receive ridiculous valuations because a longsurviving tiny tech firm usually doesnt stay small for long thus will grow at huge rates. This is why any solvent and many insolvent tech firms receive large valuations riskadjusted, they should pay out huge on average. Still, most fall by the wayside dead, and those 100 PS valuations quickly crumble. Valuations are influenced by growth. One can see this expressed more easily with a growing perpetuity Where P is price, i is income, r is the rate of return, and g is the growth rate of i. Rearranging, r looks like Here, one can see that a higher P relative to i will dull the expected rate of return while a higher g will boost it. Its fun for us value investortraders to say that the market is totally inefficient. Thats a stretch. Its not perfectly inefficient, but its efficient. Valuations are clustered very tightly around the median, but there are mistakes that even us little guys can exploit and teach the smart money a lesson or two. If one were to look at a distribution of rs, oned see that theyre even more tightly packed. So while it looks like PEs are all over the place industry to industry, rs are much more well clustered. Tech, finance, and discretionaries frequently have higher growth rates so higher PEs yet average rs. Utilities and nondiscretionaries have lower growth rates so lower PEs yet average rs."

But just from the excerpted images, it appears as though your purchase of stock was layered into multiple tranches  perhaps you acquired more of the stock in the 61day period than you sold possibly because of a prior holding. If in the 61day period around the sale of stock 30 days before and 30 days after, you also acquire the same stock including by contract or option, then it washes out your loss. If you held your stock for a while, then in a 61day period bought more, and sold some, then any loss would be washed out by the acquisition. Of course it is also a wash sale if your purchase of the stock follows your sale, rather than precedes it. Your disallowed loss goes into the basis of your stock holding, so will be meaningful when you do have a true economic sale of that stock. From IRS Pub 550 A wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you Buy substantially identical stock or securities, Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade, Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities, or Acquire substantially identical stock for your individual retirement account IRA or Roth IRA. If you sell stock and your spouse or a corporation you control buys substantially identical stock, you also have a wash sale. Looking at your excerpted account images, we can see a number of positions sold at a loss sale proceeds less than basis but each one is adjusted to a zero loss. I suspect the fuller picture of your account history and portfolio will show a more complicated and longer history with this particular stock.

Most financial planners would say this is way too risky, which sort of addresses your question. I seek high return rather than protection of principal. If I was you at 22, I would mainly look at high returns rather than protection of principal. The short answer is, that even if your investments drop by half, you have plenty of time to recover. But onto the long answer. You sort of have to imagine yourself close to retirement age, and what that would look like. If you are contributing at 22, I would say that it is likely that you end up with 3 million in todays dollars. Will you have low or high monthly expenses? Will you have other sources of income such as rental properties? Lets say you rental income that comes close to covering your monthly expenses, but is short about 12K per year. You have a couple of options So in the end lets say you are ready to retire with about 60K in cash above your emergency fund. You have the ability to live off that cash for 5 years. You can replenish that fund from equity investments at opportune times. Its also likely you equity investments will grow a lot more than your expenses and any emergencies. There really is no need to have a significant amount out of equities. In the case cited, real estate serves as your cash investment. Now one can fret and say \"how will I know I have all of that when I am ready to retire\"? The answer is simple structure your life now so it looks that way in the future. You are off to a good start. Right now your job is to build your investments in your 401K which you are doing and get good at budgeting. The rest will follow.

    "content": "They cannot refuse to accept coins and demand some other payment after providing a good or service. Legal tender is legal tender for all debts. But until they provide the good or service, they dont have to accept it. In this case, you want the service of depositing money. But by its nature, they have to accept the payment first. In that situation, they can refuse it. There is no law that banks have to accept your deposits. If they dont want you as a customer, thats their problem. Consider switching banks. Historically this was easier and some banks may still do things the old way. Call your local banks and ask. Perhaps youll find someone happy to do business with you, on your terms. As already said, some coin rolling machines will pay you with gift certificates. If you plan to buy a sufficient amount from the place that accepts the gift certificate, this can get that place to play the fee. That may help you, although it is obviously a limited solution. The goal is to make it so that you only make purchases that you would have anyway. The seller obviously has a different goal. Its possible to buy coin sorters. Heck, you could buy one with a gift certificate from a public machine. Cheap ones require extra work to get the coins rolled and may jam a lot. More expensive ones do more of the work for you. Note that a given sorter that works better may be cheaper than another that doesnt work as well. Cheap is more of a qualitative judgment than a financial measure in this case. If you carry a small amount of change with you, pretty much everywhere accepts small amounts of change for purchases. So if you have been always paying with dollars and dumping the change in a jar, instead always give the correct change coins. They may still give you dollars in change, but at least you wont get new coins. And youll use some of your existing coins. Of course, this doesnt scale well. For small purchases, say 1.50, you can often pay the whole thing in change without argument. Or if something is 18.50, you might give them 10, 5, two 1 bills, and the rest in change. If you are buying something and can see that they have little change in one of the coin buckets, offer to swap some change for bills. Sometimes places find that easier than breaking a roll. With vending machines, use change instead of dollar bills. Especially use exact change so as not to convert bills to change. They usually dont take pennies, but theyre great with nickels and above. This wont allow you to use change as a way to force yourself to save. But it will keep your change down to a manageable level going forward. And you might be able to use up your existing store. Im assuming that this isnt a fifty year coin collection that you are just now starting to process. But if you have six months of change, you should be able to use it up in a year or so. I tend to do this. So I rarely have more than a couple dollars in change. No one ever tells me that they dont take change, because I dont give anyone a lot. Maybe .99 here but more likely .43 there. Sometimes I give them, e.g., .07 so as to get .25 in change rather than .18. Its a little more work at every transaction, but it saves the big clump of work of rolling the coins. And you dont have to buy wrappers."

    "content": "If you have a great technical trading system that gets you winning trading 8085 of the time in backtesting, the question should be why are you not trading it? To get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade. This will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take. Expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio. For example if you are getting winning trades 80 of the time but your average win size is 100, and your 20 of losses average 500, then you will still be losing money. You should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size. This will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50. If your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it. Also, if you put your trading system out there in the public domain together with your trading results you will actually find that, quite opposite to what the consensus above is, your results from your trading plan should actually improve further. The more people acting on the outcome of a signal in the same direction the higher the probability that the movement in the desired direction will actually occur. If you are looking to make money from your trading ideas, no one will pay anything unless you have real results to back it up.

Does one now pay higher income tax because he has more in his account or does he pay the same because he makes the same? In most locales, you pay income tax on everything that is counted as income. Your salary is income. In some cases, earned interest is income. But aside from the earned interest from your bank accounts, neither the 40,000 nor the 9,000 is income. Your huge mansion isnt income. Your expensive car isnt income. The huge amount of land you own isnt income. The pricey artwork on your walls isnt income. You dont pay income tax on any of these, but your local may impose other taxes on these such as property tax, etc. [Note consult the tax laws of your specific locale if you want to know details.]"

If you decide to do so, depending on your investment vehicles, there might be a more costefficient way than arranging a separate futures contract with a bank If you are open to or are already investing in ETFs, there are currencyhedged versions of some popular ETFs. These are hedged against the currency risk for a specific currency for example, if you are buying in and expecting to sell for USD, you would buy an ETF hedged to USD. Of course they have a higher expense ratio than nonhedged ETFs since the costs of the necessary contracts are included in the expenses."

You can transfer funds between these two different types of ISA. If your current cash ISA provider does not provide stocks and shares ISAs, then there may be a fee involved when transferring funds between two different providers. If I am reading your notation correctly, you have contributed the full allowance of GBP15,240 in both the current tax year and the previous tax year. Each year you can contribute GBP15,240 currently to your ISAs and this can be done in any combination of cash ISA and stocks and shares ISA. For example, you could put GBP5,240 into your cash ISA and GBP10,000 into your stocks and shares ISA. Regarding your questions  It is also important to understand that once you withdraw money from an ISA, it does not affect your previous contributions or allowances. For example, if you have used your full contribution allowance for the current year and chose to withdraw some funds, then you have still used your full contribution allowance and so you cannot redeposit these funds."

    "topic": "Why will the bank only loan us 80 of the value of our fully paid for home?",
    "content": "To supplement existing answers the appraised value does not necessarily represent the net amount the bank could actually recover with a foreclosure. Lets look at it from the point of view of the bank. Suppose the property appraises at 200,000 and they do what you want loan you 200,000 with the property as collateral. Now suppose a short time later, you quit paying the mortgage and they have to foreclose. Can the bank get their 200,000 back? An appraisal is only an estimate nobody can predict perfectly how much a property will sell for. Maybe the appraiser missed something significant, and the property will only fetch 180,000. Even if the appraisal was accurate when it was made, property values may have dropped in the meantime. Maybe a sudden economic crisis is driving real estate prices down across the board. Maybe interest rates have spiked. Maybe the county has changed the zoning regulations to locate a toxic waste dump next door to the property. In any of these cases, the property may again fetch well under 200,000. Maybe the condition of the property has changed. Perhaps you trashed the place and it will take 30,000 to clean it up. People have a tendency to do things like that when they get foreclosed. If the bank wants to get full market value for the property, they will incur the usual costs of selling a property paying a real estate agents commission, painting, renting furniture to stage the property, and so on. This will eat into the net amount they actually get from the sale. It may take some time perhaps months for a property to sell at its full market value. During this time, the bank is out 200,000. Thats money they would rather be loaning out at interest to someone else, so this represents lost income. Foreclosing a mortgage is a fairly complicated procedure. The bank has to pay its staff, including lawyers, for a significant number of hours to get the foreclosure done. There will be court filing fees and so on. If you refuse to leave, they may have to get the sheriff to evict you that has a fee as well. If you fight the foreclosure, that racks up even more legal fees. This too eats into the net proceeds from the sale. So if the bank loans you the full 200,000, they stand a pretty significant risk of not getting all of it back, after expenses. You can understand that risk may not be worth the interest they would get from you on the extra 40,000. On the other hand, if they loan you only 80 of the propertys appraised value 160,000, they effectively shift that risk onto you. Should you default on the loan, and they foreclose, all they have to do is sell the property for 160,000 or a little bit more. That shouldnt be too hard, even if it is not freshly painted or a bit trashed. They probably dont need to hire a real estate agent just hold a quick auction, maybe first calling up a few investors who might be interested in flipping it. If it happens to sell for more than the outstanding principal of the loan, plus the banks costs, then they will pay you the difference but they have no incentive to make that happen, and every incentive to just get it sold quick. So any difference between the propertys true value and the actual sale price now represents a loss to you first, not to the bank. So you can see why the bank would rather not loan you the full value of the property. 80 is a somewhat arbitrary figure but it cuts their risk by a lot."

    "content": "For some people, its easier to stick to a budget if they have separate checking and savings accounts because they can deposit funds directly into their savings account and not have those funds accessible by debitcredit card, checks, etc. This allows people to pay themselves first and accumulate savings, while making it slightly more difficult to spend those savings on a whim. One a more technicallegal note, one key difference in the United States comes from Regulation D. 204.2d2 of the law limits you to six withdrawals from savings and money market accounts. No such limit exists for checking accounts. Regulation D also forbids banks from paying interest on business checking accounts. In the simplest case, checking accounts and savings accounts are a tradeoff between liquidity and return. Checking accounts are much more liquid, but wont necessarily earn interest, while savings accounts are less liquid because of the withdrawal limits, but earn interest. Nowadays, however, sweep accounts blur this line somewhat because they function like checking accounts, in that you can write an unlimited number of checks, make an unlimited number of withdrawals, etc. but you can also earn interest on your account balance because some or all of the funds are \"swept\" into an investment account when not in use. The definition of \"in use\" can vary from business to business and bank to bank."

Thus, you will be required to put up more money as margin to finance your position. Margin money is simply a \"good faith\" deposit held by your broker. It is not money that is debited as cash from the accounting ledger of your trading account, but is held by your broker to cover any potential losses that may arise when you finally settle you position. Conversely, when the underlying share price is decreasing, the net margin requirements will tend to decrease day by day. Net margin is the net of \"Initial Margin\" and \"Variation Margin\". As the expiry date approaches, the \"time value\" component of the option price will be decreasing."

If my sister, who works for a drugs testing company, tells me that stage 3 trials of a drug look like they will fail and I trade on that information probably by shorting a companys stock that is insider trading. If an employee of that firm trades on that same stock knowing that the trials are likely to fail that is too. If an employee of that company trades on the stock without knowing that information that is NOT insider trading. If I know from an insider I met at the pub that a large orange producer has seen a fall in production due to a blight and I trade on oranges futures, even though I am not directly trading in the stock it is still insider trading. I mentioned that the information must be material, that means that it must have the potential to move the market if I know that a firm is going to increase profits by 10 this year it is not material if analyst expectations are for a similar rise. You are right that small scale insider trading, such as by employees and their families, is relatively unregulated and unchecked but directors and Clevel employees of a firm are required to publish all and any dealings that they have in the stock and several have been caught and penalized for insider trading. edit httpwww.sec.govspotlightinsidertradingcases.shtml details some cases, many involving director and Clevel employees, that the SEC has prosecuted recently. Incidentally I work in financial fraud monitoring and we use an analytic based on previous days trades and todays news i.e. when the information becomes public to identify traders who might either be indulging in or receiving orders to trade on insider information. Essentially this works by looking for large changes in position against an instrument that later has material information releases relevant to it. One final thing to think about given that being caught will generally cause perpetrators to go to prison and be banned from director level jobs andor trading for life as well as a large, lifechanging fine and a massive loss of reputation not many people with insider information want to risk trading on it, myself included."

They can complete their task in just a couple of hours. If the home inspection comes back relatively clean, the transaction should be very easy. The paperwork is the biggest hurdle. You should jointly identify a local settlement company. They will be the ones actually filing the paperwork. They have lawyers. They will check the county records office for existing liens, plats, mortgages and address all the issues. They can send the proper paperwork to the existing mortgage companies and arrange for mortgage insurance. The cost will be the same regardless of the presence of real estate agents and other lawyers.

The term leverage refers to one possible economic interpretation of this phenomenon, developed in Black 1976 and Christie 1982 as asset prices decline, companies become mechanically more leveraged since the relative value of their debt rises relative to that of their equity.

    "content": "In the United States, if someone refers to the \"interest rate\", especially if heard on news or talk radio in particular, they are almost always referring to the federal funds rate, a rate set forth and maintained by the United States Federal Reserve the \"fed\" for short. If the fed opts to raise or lower this rate, it subsequently effects all interest rates, whether by being directly connected in a chain of loans or by market demand through the efficiency of financial markets in the case of bond auctions. The FOMC meets eight times each year to determine the target for the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate effects all interest rates because it is the originating rate of interest on all loans in the chain of loans. Because of this significance as a benchmark for all interest rates, it is the rate most commonly referred to as \"interest rate\" when used alone. That is why other rates are specified by what they actually are e.g., mortgage rates 10 year  30 year for 10 year treasury and 30 year treasury bond yields respectively savings rate, auto rate, credit card rate, CD rateall rates of interest effected by the originating loan that is the federal funds rate. This is true in the United States but will vary for other countries. In general though, it will almost always refer to the originating rate for all loans in a given country, institution, etc. Note that bonds have yields that are based on market demand that is, in turn, based on the federal funds rate. It is because of the efficiency of financial markets that the demand, and thus the yields, are correlated to the federal funds rate."

They are trying to prevent high inflation rates on one hand or deflation on the other. When the interest rate on Tbills is low, banks will borrow more money. As the Fed creates this money out of thin air when banks buy a Tbill, this adds money to the economy. When the interest rate on Tbills is high, banks will borrow little or nothing. As theyll be repaying older Tbills, this will result in less growth in the money supply or even contraction.

Mongus Pongs answer is a great answer, Im going to approach from a more anecdotal POV. Think about the fear that was in the air in Fall 2008. From my recollection, that shortterm stabilization came from the Fed, President, Congress, etc standing up and saying that the government would do everything in its power to maintain liquidity in the marketplace. So the fear of a broader collapse of investment banks beyond Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, etc due to the Fed behaving as it did in 1929 was abated. By the time you got to Q1 of 2009, it became clear that business vaporized  nothing was happening. No cars were selling, Christmas was dismal, vacations were cancelled. example I went on vacation to a fancy resort in December 2008 and paid 60night for a 450night room! The place was half empty."

    "topic": "At what interest rate should debt be used as a tool?",
    "content": "This is a very interesting question. Im going to attempt to answer it. Use debt to leverage investment. Historically, stock markets have returned 10 p.a., so today when interest rates are very low, and depending on which country you live in, you could theoretically borrow money at a very low interest rate and earn 10 p.a., pocketing the difference. This can be done through an ETF, mutual funds and other investment instruments. Make sure you have enough cash flow to cover the interest payments! Similar to the concept of acid ratio for companies, you should have slightly more than enough liquid funds to meet the monthly payments. Naturally, this strategy only works when interest rates are low. After that, youll have to think of other ideas. However, IMO the Fed seems to be heading towards QE3 so we might be seeing a prolonged period of low interest rates, so borrowing seems like a sensible option now. Since the movements of interest rates are political in nature, monitoring this should be quite simple. It depends on you. Since interest rates are the opportunity cost of spending money, the lower the interest rates, the lower the opportunity costs of using money now and repaying it later. Interest rates are a market mechanism so that people who prefer to spend later can lend to people who prefer to spend now for the price of interest. Disclaimer Historically stocks have returned 10 p.a., but that doesnt mean this trend will continue indefinitely as we have seen fixed income outperform stocks in the recent past."

On Microsofts and most other companys cash flow statements, they use the socalled \"indirect method\" of accounting for cash flow from operations. How that works, is they start with net income at the top, and then adjust it with line items for the various noncash activities that contributed to net income. The key phrase is that these are accounting for the noncash activities that contribute to net income. If the accounts receivable amount changes from something other than operating activity e.g., if they have to write off some receivables because they wont be paid, the change didnt contribute to net income in the first place, so doesnt need to be reconciled on the cash flow statement."

The main reason to open one now rather than later is that some types of withdrawls require the account be aged 5 years. But you can also withdraw the amount youve contributed tax free any time. Student loans right now are pricey, so if youre carrying a balance at say 6.8 percent fixed you should pay that down ASAP. Beyond that, Id keep the rest liquid for now. Having that kind of liquid cash is extremely reassuring, and many of the biggest returns on investment are going to be in your personal life. More fuel efficient vehicles, energy efficient appliances, computer backups, chest freezers and bulk meat purchases, etc. One example I see every six months is car insurance I can pay for six months in full or I can pay a smaller monthly bill plus a small fee. That fee is well above current market rates. You see this everywhere people searching for lower minimum payments rather than lower total costs. Save your money up and be the smart buyer.

Your lender would always be on the policy since it is an insurance policy they hold and you pay for that protects them from you defaulting on the loan. Dont think of it as insurance for you in case you cant pay. If that should happen, your credit would still be trashed, the bank just wouldnt be out the money. You dont really get any benefit at all from it. It is just the way a bank can mitigate the risk of giving out large loans. This is why people are keen to drop it as soon as possible. The whole thing about keeping the house in your estate after you die makes me think he is trying to sell you a different type of insurance called Mortgage Life Insurance. PMI isnt typically about that type of situation. Your estate will go into probate to work out your debts if you die and my understanding is that PMI doesnt usually pay out in that situation. If this is what he is selling, buying such a policy would be on top of your PMI insurance payment, not instead of it. Be forewarned, personal finance experts usually consider mortgage life insurance to be a ripoff. If you want to protect against the risk of your heirs losing the house because they cant make the payments, you are better off with Term Life Insurance. However, dont worry that they will inherit your debt on the house unless they are on the loan. If they dont want the house, they wont be obliged to make payments on it unless they want to keep it. It wont affect their credit if they just walk away and let the bank have the house after you die unless they are on the note.

    "content": "First lets understand what convexity means Convexity  convexity refers to nonlinearities in a financial model. In other words, if the price of an underlying variable changes, the price of an output does not change linearly, but depends on the second derivative or, loosely speaking, higherorder terms of the modeling function. Geometrically, the model is no longer flat but curved, and the degree of curvature is called the convexity. Okay so for us idiots this means if the price of ABC we will call P is determined by X and Y. Then if X decreases by 5 then the value of P might not necessarily decrease by 5 but instead is also dependent on Y wtf! is Y?, who cares, its not important for us to know, we can understand what convexity is without knowing the math behind it. So if we chart this the line would look like a curve. clearly this is an over simplification of the math involved but it gives us an idea So now in terms of options, convexity is also known as gamma, it will probably be easier to talk about gamma instead of using a confusing word like convexitygamma is the convexity of options. So lets define Gamma Gamma  The rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying assets price. So the gamma of an option indicates how the delta of an option will change relative to a 1 point move in the underlying asset. In other words, the Gamma shows the option deltas sensitivity to market price changes. or Gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset. So the answer is If we are long gamma convexity of an option it simply means we are betting on higher volatility in the underlying assetin your case the VIX. Really that simple? Well kinda, to fully understand how this works you really need to understand the math behind it. But yes being long gamma means being long volatility. An example of being \"long gamma\" is a \"long straddle\" Side Note I personally do trade the VIX and it can be very volatile, you can make or lose lots of money very quickly trading VIX options.

    "content": "If a stock is trading for 11 per share just before a 1 per share dividend is declared, then the share price drops to 10 per share immediately following the declaration. If you owned 100 shares valued at 1100 before the dividend was declared, then you still own 100 shares now valued at 1000. Generally, if the dividend is paid today, only the owners of shares as of yesterday evening or the day before maybe get paid the dividend. If you bought those 100 shares only this morning, the dividend gets paid to the seller who owned the stock until yesterday evening, not to you. You just \"bought a dividend\" paying 1100 for 100 shares that are worth only 1000 at the end of the day, whereas if you had just been a little less eager to purchase right now, you could have bought those 100 shares for only 1000. But, looking at the bright side, if you bought the shares earlier than yesterday, you get paid the dividend. So, assuming that you bought the shares in timely fashion, your holdings just lost value and are worth only 1000. What you do have is the promise that in a couple of days time, you will be paid 100 as the dividend, thus restoring the asset value back to what it was earlier. Now, if you had asked your broker to reinvest the dividend back into the same stock, then, assuming that the stock price did not change in the interim due to normal market fluctuations, you would get another 10 shares for that 100 dividend making the value of your investment 1100 again 110 shares at 10 each, exactly what it was before the dividend was paid. If you didnt choose to reinvest the dividend, you would still have the 100 shares worth 1000 plus 100 cash. So, regardless of what other investors choose to do, your asset value does not change as a result of the dividend. What does change is your net worth because that dividend amount is taxable regardless of whether you chose to reinvest or not and so your tax liability just increased."

In other cases the transaction may be reported through another business. A few years ago the local PTA was having a silent auction as a fundraiser. A local business allowed the PTA to use their credit card reader to process transactions over a certain amount. Of course when the credit card statement arrived it looked like you spent 500 at the florist. I have seen PayPal listed when donating to some small charities. I have noted another case where confusion can occur. I used a debit card to buy a soda from a vending machine the name and location were the name of the vending machine company and the location of their main office. It didnt say soda machine city A. It said Joes vending company city B. In most cases the business and the credit card company want to make it easy to identify the transactions to keep the cost of research and charge backs to a minimum."

    "topic": "Would I ever need credit card if my debit card is issued by MasterCardVisa?",
    "content": "My view is from the Netherlands, a EU country. Con Credit cards are more risky. If someone finds your card, they can use it for online purchases without knowing any PIN, just by entering the card number, expiration date, and security code on the back. Worse, sometimes that information is stored in databases, and those get stolen by hackers! Also, you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them, stopped using the service, and be surprised about the charge later. Debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your PIN to do online payments the ones I have in the Netherlands do, anyway, and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones. Con Banks get a percentage of each credit card payment. Unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction of, say, half a cent, credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more, a significant part of the profit margin. I feel this is just wrong. Con automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment With debit cards, the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money isnt there, you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way credit card after all, other bank account, cash, etc. When a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently, someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money wasnt there. So I had to pay interest, on something I bought weeks ago... Pro Credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance. Ive never used this and dont know how it works, but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges. Pro Credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases I dont know how it is with Visa or MCissued debit cards, but many US sites accept only cards that have numberexpiration datesecurity code and thus my normal bank account debit card isnt useable. Conclusion definitely have one, but only use it when absolutely necessary."

    "topic": "Is it preferable to move emergency savingsretirement into offset mortgage?",
    "content": "Assuming no constraints on how much you can move or how frequently into and out of your offset mortgage account, the question becomes one of what rate of return you expect from your longterm savingsemergency cash fund. The rate you are getting from the offset mortgage account is known since it reduces the principal amount owing and thus reduces interest charges, the return is the mortgage rate though I would not be surprised if the offset mortgage account contract has bells and whistles reducing the effective rate, saying something like 3 pounds reduction of principal for every 5 pounds you put in. So, as a movie character once said, \"Do you feel lucky today?\" If so, move money from your offset mortgage account to savings, and earn more. If not, move money in the opposite direction. A \"guaranteed\" 2 return on the offset mortgage account might be better than taking a risk on the vagaries of the stock market, and even the possibility of loss in your long term savings account."

    "topic": "I have savings and excess income. Is it time for me to find a financial advisor?",
    "content": "Many of my friends said I should invest my money on stocks or something else, instead of put them in the bank forever. I do not know anything about finance, so my questions are First let me say that your friends may have the best intentions, but dont trust them. It has been my experience that friends tell you what they would do if they had your money, and not what they would actually do with their money. Now, I dont mean that they would be malicious, or that they are out to get you. What I do mean, is why would you take advise from someone about what they would do with 100k when they dont have 100k. I am in your financial situation more or less, and I have friends that make more then I do, and have no savings. Or that will tell you to get an IRA soandso but dont have the means discipline to do so. Do not listen to your friends on matters of money. Thats just good all around advise. Is my financial status OK? If not, how can I improve it? Any financial situation with no or really low debt is OK. I would say 5 of annual income in unsecured debt, or 23 years in annual income in secured debt is a good place to be. That is a really hard mark to hit it seems. You have hit it. So your good, right now. You may want to \"plan for the future\". Immediate goals that I always tell people, are 6 months of income stuck in a liquid savings account, then start building a solid investment situation, and a decent retirement plan. This protects you from short term situations like loss of job, while doing something for the future. Is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor? Is it worthy? How would shehe help me? Rather its worth it or not to use a financial adviser is going to be totally opinion based. Personally I think they are worth it. Others do not. I see it like this. Unless you want to spend all your time looking up money stuff, the adviser is going to have a better grasp of \"money stuff\" then you, because they do spend all their time doing it. That being said there is one really important thing to consider. That is going to be how you pay the adviser. The following are my observations. You will need to make up your own mind. Free Avoid like the plague. These advisers are usually provided by the bank and make their money off commission or kickbacks. That means they will advise you of the product that makes them the most money. Not you. Flat Rate These are not a bad option, but they dont have any real incentive to make you money. Usually, they do a decent job of making you money, but again, its usually better for them to advise you on products that make them money. Per Hour These are my favorite. They charge per hour. Usually they are a small shop, and will walk you through all the advise. They advise whats best for you, because they have to sit there and explain their choices. They can be hard to find, but are generally the best option in my opinion.  of Money These are like the flat rate advisers to me. They get a percentage of the money you give them to \"manage\". Because they already have your money they are more likely to recommend products that are in their interest. That said, there not all bad.  or Profit These are the best see notes later. They get a percentage of the money they make for you. They have the most interest in making you money. They only get part of what you get, so there going to make sure you get the biggest pie, so they can get a bigger slice. Notes In the real world, all advisers are likely to get kickbacks on products they recommend. Make sure to keep an eye for that. Also most advisers will use 23 of the methods listed above for billing. Something like z of profit x per hour is what I like to see. You will have to look around and see what is available. Just remember that you are paying someone to make you money or to advise you on how to make money so long as what they take leaves you with some profit your in a better situation then your are now. And thats the real goal."

In summary, a company that wishes to cancel the right of any of its trading securities must The notification to the Exchange should be made by the companys nominated adviser and should be given at least 20 business days prior to the intended cancellation date the 20 business days notice requirement is a minimum. Any cancellation of a companys securities on AIM will be conditional upon seeking shareholder approval in general meeting of not less than 75 of votes cast by its shareholders present and voting in person or by proxy at the meeting. The notification to shareholders should set out the preferred date of cancellation, the reasons for seeking the cancellation for example annual fees to the Exchange, the cost of maintaining a nominated adviser and broker, professional costs, corporate governance compliance, inability to access funds on the market, a description of how shareholders will be able to effect transactions in the AIM securities once they have been cancelled and any other matters relevant to shareholders reaching an informed decision upon the issue of the cancellation. Cancellation will not take effect until at least 5 business days after the shareholder approval is obtained and a dealing notice has been issued by the Exchange. It should be noted that there are circumstances where the Exchange may agree that shareholder consent is not required for the cancellation of admission of a companys shares, for example i where comparable dealing facilities on an EU regulated market or AIM designated market are put in place to enable shareholders to trade their AIM securities in the future or ii where, pursuant to a takeover which has become wholly unconditional, an offeror has received valid acceptances in excess of 75 of each class of AIM securities.

    "topic": "Typical return for an IRA? How can I assess if my returns were decent?",
    "content": "To try and address your how it goes a bit like this. You need to first assess how your stuff is invested, if for example half is in stocks, and the other half is in bonds, then you will need to calculate a blended rate for what are reasonable average return for both. That might mean looking at the SP500 or Russell 3000 for the stock portion, and some bond index for that portion, then blend the rates, in this case using a formula like this then compare the blended rate with the return in your IRA. It is generally a lot more useful to compare the various components of your total return separately, especially if you investing with a particular style such as agressive growth or you are buying actual bonds and not a bond fund since most of the bond oriented indexes are for bond funds, which you cant really compare well with buying and holding bonds to maturity. Lets say your stock side was two mutual funds with different styles, one large cap the other aggressive growth. In that case you might want to compare each one of those funds with an appropriate index such as those provided by Morningstar If you find one of them is consistently below the average, you might want to consider finding an alternative fund whos manager has a better track record bearing in mind that \"past performance....\" For me maybe someone has a good suggestion here bonds are the hard thing to judge. The normal goal of actually owning bonds as opposed to a fund is to retain the entire principal value because theres no principal fluctuation if you hold the bond to maturity as long as you choose well and the issuer doesnt default The actual value right now of a bond as in selling before maturity and bond funds, goes up and down in an inverse relationship with interest rates. That means the indexes for such things also go up and down a lot, so its very hard to compare them to a bond you intend to hold to maturity. Also, for such a bond, theres not a lot of point to switch out unless you are worried about the issuer defaulting. If rates are up from what you are getting on your bonds, then youll have to sell your bond at a discount, and all that happens is youll end up holding a different bond that is worth less, but has higher interest basically the net return is likely to be pretty much the same. The better approach there is generally to ladder your maturity dates so you get opportunities to reinvest at whatever the prevailing rates are, without having to sell at a discount.. anyway the point is that Im not sure theres a lot of value to comparing return on the bond portion of an IRA unless its invested in bond funds which a lot of people wanting to preserve principal tend to avoid"

Rereading your question, I see you are considering investing in a Roth IRA. Especially at your current age, assuming your wages will go UP, investing to the company match with the 401K and then maxing out a Roth IRA would be my recommendation.

    "topic": "How are bonds affected by the Federal Funds Rate?",
    "content": "The federal funds rate is one of the riskfree shortterm rates in the economy. We often think of fixed income securities as paying this rate plus some premia associated with risk. For a treasury security, we can think this way interest rate  fed funds rate  term premium The term premium is a bit extra the bond pays because if you hold a long term bond, you are exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that rates will generally rise after you buy, making your bond worth less. The relation is more complex if people have expectations of future rate moves, but this is the general idea. Anyway, generally speaking, longer term bonds are exposed to more interest rate risk, so they pay more, on average. For a corporate bond, we think this way interest rate  fed funds rate  term premium  default premium where the default premium is some extra that the bond must pay to compensate the holder for default risk, which is the risk that the bond defaults or loses value as the companys prospects fall. You can see that corporate and government bonds are affected the same way approximately, this is all handwaving by changes in the fed funds rate. Now, that all refers to the rates on new bonds. After a bond is issued, its value falls if rates rise because new bonds are relatively more attractive. Its value rises if rates on new bonds falls. So if there is an unexpected rise in the fed funds rate and you are holding a bond, you will be sad, especially if it is a long term bond doesnt matter if its corporate or government. Ask yourself, though, whether an increase in fed funds will be unexpected at this point. If the increase was expected, it will already be priced in. Are you more of an expert than the folks on wallstreet at predicting interest rate changes? If not, it might not make sense to make decisions based on your belief about where rates are going. Just saying. Brick points out that treasuries are tax advantaged. That is, you dont have to pay state income tax on them but you do pay federal. If you live in a state where this is true, this may matter to you a little bit. They also pay unnaturally little because they are convenient for use as a cash substitute in transactions and margining \"convenience yield\". In general, treasuries just dont pay much. Young folk like you tend to buy corporate bonds instead, so they can make money on the default and term premia."

Instead of holding cards like this, I wish I had flipped it to a different card years ago.

I have done the same with balance transfer paperwork, in that case the bank knew the customer and the balance transfer was his usual. If the friend does not have an account there, then she should maybe open an account at an \"online bank\" that allows deposit by snapping photos on a phone, or phone up a branch, describe herhis situation and see if they have any options. Alternately, she could get a PayPal account. Or get one of those \"credit card swipe on your phone\" deals like Square or PayPal Here, which have fees very close to nil, normally cards are swiped but you can handenter the numbers. Those are fairly easy to get even if you have troubles with creditworthiness. She would need to return the check to the payer and ask the payer to pay herhim one of those ways. The payer may not be able to, e.g. if they are a large corporation. A last possibility is if the check is from a large corporation with whom she continues to do business with. For instance, the electric company cashiers out your account after you terminate service at your old location. But then you provision service at a new location and get a new bill, you can send their check right back to them and say \"Please apply this to my new account\". If she is unable to get any of those because of more serious problems like being in the country illegally, then, lawful behavior has its privileges, sorry. There are lots of unbanked people, and they pay through the nose for banking services at those ghastly checkcashing places, at least in America.

However, you cannot hold your home in the SMSF, as this would be classed as an inhouse asset, and you are only allowed to hold a maximum of 5 of the total market value of SMSF as inhouse assets. Furthermore, as you already own your house, you are not allowed to transfer residential property into a SMSF from a related party, even if done at current market value you are allowed to transfer business real property from a related party at current market value.

The bottom line is that the loan payment doesnt lower your borrowing power as it fits in the slice between 28 total housing cost and 38 total monthly debt burden when applying for a loan. But, the 20K is 20 down on 100K worth of house. With median home prices in the US in the midhigh 100Ks, youre halfway there. In the end, its not about finance, its a question of how badly you want to buy a house. If I got along with the parents, Id stay as long as I was welcome, and save every dollar I could. Save for retirement, save for as large a downpayment as you can, and after you buy the house, pay the student loan aggressively. I moved out the week after I graduated."

    "content": "It also depends on where you work. If you move your home and your job then the date you establish residency in the new state is the key date. All income before that date is considered income for state 1, and all income on or after that date is income for state 2. If there is a big difference in income you will want to clearly establish residency because it impacts your wallet. If they had the same rates moving wouldnt impact your wallet, but it would impact each state. So make sure when going from high tax state to low tax state that you register your vehicles, register to vote, get a new drivers license... It becomes more complex if you move your home but not your job. In that case where you work might be the deciding factor. Same states have agreed that where you live is the deciding factor in other cases it is not. For Virginia, Maryland, and DC you pay based on where you live if the two states involved are DC, MD, VA. But if you Live in Delaware and work in Virginia Virginia wants a cut of your income tax. So before you move you need to research reciprocity for the two states. From Massachusetts information for Nonresident and PartYear Resident Income, Exemptions, Deductions and Credits Massachusetts gross income includes items of income derived from sources within Massachusetts. This includes income a few questions later Massachusetts residents and partyear residents are allowed a credit for taxes due to any other jurisdiction. The credit is available only on income reported and taxed on a Massachusetts return. Nonresidents may not claim the taxes paid to other jurisdiction credit on their Massachusetts Form 1NRPY. The credit is allowed for income taxes paid to The credit is not allowed for taxes paid to the U.S. government or a foreign country other than Canada city or local tax and interest and penalty paid to another jurisdiction. The computation is based on comparing the Massachusetts income tax on income reported to the other jurisdiction to the actual tax paid to the other jurisdiction the credit is limited to the smaller of these two numbers. The other jurisdiction credit is a line item on the tax form but you must calculate it on the worksheet in the instruction booklet and also enter the credit information on the Schedule OJC. So if you move your house to New Hampshire, but continue to work in Massachusetts you will owe income tax to Massachusetts for that income even after you move and establish residency in New Hampshire."

    "content": "The reason diversification in general is a benefit is easily seen in your first graph. While the purple line Betterment 100 Stock is always below the blue line SP, and the blue line is the superior return over the entire period, its a bit different if you retired in 2009, isnt it? In that case the orange line is superior because its risk is much lower, so it didnt drop much during the major crash. Lowering risk and lowering return is a benefit the closer you get to retirement as you wont see as big a cumulative return from the large percentage, but you could see a big temporary drop, and need your income to be relatively stable if youre living off it or soon going to. Now, you can certainly invest on your own in a diverse way, and if youre reasonably smart about it and have enough funds to avoid any fees, you can almost certainly do better than a managed solution  even a relatively lightly managed solution like Betterment. They take .15 off the top, so if you just did exactly the same as them, you would end up .15 per year better off. However, not everyone is reasonably smart, and not everyone has much in the way of funds. Betterments target audience are people who arent terribly smart about investing andor have very small amounts of funds to invest. Plenty of people arent able to work out how to do diversification on their own while they probably mostly arent asking questions on this site, theyre a large percentage of the population. Its also work to diversify your portfolio you have to make minor changes every year at a minimum to ensure you have a nicely balanced portfolio. This is why target retirement date portfolios are very popular a bit higher cost similar to Betterment, roughly but no work required to diversify correctly and maintain that diversification."

    "content": "You might consider learning how the \"matching\" or \"pairing\" system in the market operates. The actual exchange only happens when both a buyer and a seller overlap their respect quotes. Sometimes orders \"go to market\" for a particular volume. Eg get me 10,000 Microsoft shares now. which means that the price starts at the current lowest seller, and works up the price list until the volume is met. Like all market it trades, it has its advantages, and its dangers. If you are confident Microsoft is going to bull, you want those shares now, confident youll recoup the cost. Where if you put in a priced order, you might get only none or some shares. Same as when you sell. If you see the price which is the price of the last completed \"successful\" trade. and think \"Im going to sell 1000 shares\". then you give the order to the market or broker, and then the same as what happened as before. the highest bidder gets as much as they asked for, if theres still shares left over, they go to the next bidder, and so on down the price... and the last completed \"successful\" trade is when your last sale is made at the lowest price of your batch. If youre selling, and selling 100,000 shares. And the highest bidder wants 1,000,000 shares youll only see the price drop to that guys bid. Why will it drop off the quoted price?. Because the quoted price is the LAST sale, clearly if theres someone still with an open bid on the market...then either he wants more shares than were available the price stays same, or his bid wasnt as high as the last bid so when you sale goes through, it will be at the price hes offering. Which is why being able to see the price queues is important on large traders. It is also why it can be important put stops and limits on your trades, een through you can still get gapped if youre unlucky. However putting prices \"Open Orders\" vs \"atMarket Orders\" can mean that youre sitting there waiting for a bouncespike while the action is all going on without you. safer but not as much gain maybe   thats the excitement of the market, for every option theres advantages...and risks... eg missing out There are also issues with stock movement, shadowing, and stop hunting, which can influence the price.

Shed have the cash not only from the house, but from every bit of our possessions that can be sold.

If they were your grandfathers and you plan to leave them to your own grandkids, Id leave them out.  I make this point for two reasons  as someone with an eye toward retirement, the house doesnt get included in the 4 return math that I apply to the retirement and stock accounts. Also, in our situation, even when we downsize at retirement, the move isnt likely to pull much cash out of the house, it will be a lateral move.

    "content": "To answer the first part of your question yes, Ive done that! I did even a bit more. I once had a job that I wasnt sure Id keep and the economy wasnt great either. In case my next employer wouldnt let me contribute to a 401k from day one, and because I didnt want to underfund my retirement and be stuck with a higher tax bill  I \"frontloaded\" my 401k contributions to be maxed out before the end of the year. The contribution limits were lower than 16,500year back then  As for the reduced cash flow  you need of course a \"buffer\" account containing several months worth of living expenses to afford maxing out or \"frontloading\" 401k contributions. You should be paying your bills out of such buffer account and not out of each paycheck. As for the reduced cash flow  I think largescale 401kIRA contributions can crowd out other longterm saving priorities such as saving for a house down payment and the tradeoff between them is a real concern. If theyre crowding out basic and discretionary consumer expenses, thats a totally different kind of problem, which you dont seem to have, which is great  So about the tradeoff between largescale 401k contributions and saving for the down payment. Id say maxing out 401k can foster the savings culture that will eventually pay its dividends. If, after several years of maxing out your 401k you decide that saving for the house is the top priority, youll see money flow to the moneymarket account marked for the down payment at a substantial monthly rate, thanks to that savings culture. As for the increasing future earnings  no. Most people Ive known for a long time, if they saved 20 when they made 20Kyear, they continued to save 20 or more when they later made 100Kyear. People who spent the entire paycheck while making 50Kyear, always say, if only I got a raise to 60Kyear, Id save a few thousand. But they eventually graduate to 100Kyear and still spend the entire paycheck. Its all about your savings culture. On the second part of your question  yes, Roth is a great tool, especially if you believe that the future tax rates will be higher to fix the longterm budget deficits. So, contributing to 401k to maximize the match, then max out Roth, as others suggested, is a great advice. After youve done that, see what else you can do more 401k, saving for the house, etc."

    "topic": "CEO entitlement from share ownership?",
    "content": "In its basic form, a corporation is a type of privileged democracy. Instead of every citizen having a vote, votes are allocated on the basis of share ownership. In the most basic form, each share you own gives you 1 vote. In most public companies, very few shareholders vote [because their vote is statistically meaningless, and they have no particular insight into what they want in their Board]. This means that often the Board is voted in by a \"plurality\" [ie 1050] of shareholders who are actually large institutions like investment firms or pension funds which own many shares of the company. Now, what do shareholders actually \"vote on\"? You vote to elect individuals to be members of the Board of Directors \"BoD\". The BoD is basically an overarching committee that theoretically steers the company in whatever way they feel best represents the shareholders because if they do not represent the shareholders, they will get voted out at the next shareholder meeting. The Board members are typically senior individuals with experience in either that industry or a relevant one ie someone who was a top lawyer may sit on the BoD and be a member of some type of legal issues committee. These positions typically pay some amount of money, but often they are seen as a form of high prestige for someone nearing  after retirement. It is not typically a full time job. It will typically pay far, far less than the role of CEO at the same company. The BoD meets periodically, to discuss issues regarding the health of the company. Their responsibility is to act in the interests of the shareholders, but they themselves do not necessarily own shares in the company. Often the BoD is broken up into several committees, such as an investment committee [which reviews and approves large scale projects], a finance committee [which reviews and approves large financial decisions, such as how to get funding], an audit committee [which reviews the results of financial statements alongside the external accountants who audit them], etc. But arguably the main role of the BoD is to hire the Chief Executive Officer and possibly other high level individuals [typically referred to as the CSuite executives, ie Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, etc.] The CEO is the Big Cheese, who then typically has authority to rule everyone below himher. Typically there are things that the Big Cheese cannot do without approval from the board, like start huge investment projects requiring a lot of spending. So the Shareholders own the company [and are therefore entitled to receive all the dividends from profits the company earns] and elects members of the Board of Directors, the BoD oversees the company on the Shareholders behalf, and the CEO acts based on the wishes of the BoD which hires himher. So how do you get to be a member of the Board, or the CEO? You become a superstar in your industry, and go through a similar process as getting any other job. You network, you make contacts, you apply, you defend yourself in interviews. The shareholders will elect a Board who acts in their interests. And the Board will hire a CEO that they feel can carry out those interests. If you hold a majority of the shares in a company, you could elect enough Board members that you could control the BoD, and you could then be guaranteed to be hired as the CEO. If you own, say, 10 of the shares you will likely be able to elect a few people to the Board, but maybe not enough to be hired by the Board as the CEO. Short of owning a huge amount of a company, therefore, share ownership will not get you any closer to being the CEO."

Thats why singlestock options are far more liquid than singlestock futures. However, if you are a farmer with a huge mortgage depending upon the chaos of agricultural markets which are extremely volatile, a different structure might appeal to you. You could long your inputs while shorting your outputs, locking in a profit. That profit is probably lower than what one could expect over the long run without hedging, but it will surely be less volatile. Heres where the advantage of futures come in for that kind of structure the margin on the longs and shorts can offset each other, forcing the farmer to have to put up much less of ones own money to hedge. With options, this is not the case. Also, the gross margin between the inputs rarely fluctuate to an unmanageable degree, so if your shorts rise faster than your longs, youll only have to post margin in the amount of the change in the net of the longs and shorts. This is why while options on commodities exist to satisfy speculators, futures are the most liquid."

That said, when determining if your future business is profitable, you need to ask \"what aspects of the business can I control\"? Can you control how much each item sells for? Increasing your prices will increase your gross margins, which should be higher than your fixed and variable costs. If your margins do not exceed your costs, then you will note be profitable. Note that as a vendor you are at a slight disadvantage to a retailer, since tax has to be baked in to your prices. A retailer can advertise the pretax price, and passthrough sales tax at the point of sale. However, people expect to pay more at a vending machine, so the disadvantage is very small you arent directly competing with retailers anyways."

If they have a billing address in California, and a shipping address in Nevada, and the goods are shipping to Nevada, you do not have to declare tax. If you have a mixture of tangible computer, mouse, keyboard and intangible assets warranty in a cart, and the shipping address is in California, you charge tax on the tangible assets, but NOT on the intangible assets. Yes, you can charge tax on the whole order. Yes for most businesses thats \"Good enough\", but Im not trying to provide the \"good enough\" solution, Im simply telling you how very large businesses run and operate. As Ive mentioned, Ive done several tax integrations using software called Sabrix Google if youve not heard of it, and have done those integrations for companies like the BBC and Corbis owned and operated by Bill Gates. Take it or leave it, but the correct way to charge taxes, especially given the complex tax laws of the US and internationally, is to charge per item. If you just need the \"good enough\" approach, feel free to calculate it by total. Some additional reading httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTaxationofDigitalGoods Another possible federal limitation on Internet taxation is the United States Supreme Court case, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 1992,[6] which held that under the dormant commerce clause, goods purchased through mail order cannot be subject to a states sales tax unless the vendor has a substantial nexus with the state levying the tax. In 1997, the federal government decided to limit taxation of Internet activity for a period of time. The Internet Tax Freedom Act ITFA prohibits taxes on Internet access, which is defined as a service that allows users access to content, information, email or other services offered over the Internet and may include access to proprietary content, information, and other services as part of a package offered to customers. The Act has exceptions for taxes levied before the statute was written and for sales taxes on online purchases of physical goods."

    "content": "The answer to this question will vary considerably by state and how utilities are regulated in your area. In New York, ESCOs Energy Supply Companies are almost always a ripoff for consumers versus the oldstyle regulated utility in NY the utility supply markups are tightly regulated, but ESCOs are less regulated. You also need to really understand the marketplace rules for \"locking in\" a price. If you can lock in the July price for natural gas for a year, that rocks. There are other factors as well. But even then its a real bet, since weather and supply factors can have a dramatic effect on gas prices in the winter. IMO, the best bet is to run with the market rates and bank the efficiency improvements that you build into your home over time. Some utilities offer \"budget plans\" that smooth out your payments without interest  Id recommend that route if predictable bills are your goal."

Basically, if market conditions are good, youll have someone else paying your mortgage. The disadvantage of the situation is that youre a landlord. So you have to deal with your tenant, who is also a neighbor. Most tenants are fine, but the occasional difficult person may come out of the woodwork. That model of achieving home ownership became less popular in the late 60searly 70s when the law allowed two incomes to be used for mortgage underwriting. Also, as suburbanization became a national trend, absentee landlords became more common Sounds like you are in the right place at the right time, and have stumbled into a good deal."

    "content": "If you are putting down less than 20 expect to need to pay PMI. When you first applied they should have described you a group of options ranging from minimal to 20 down. The monthly amounts would have varied based on PMI, down payment, and interest rate. The maximum monthly payment for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance will determine the maximum loan you can get. The down payment determines the price of the house above the mortgage amount. During the most recent real estate bubble, lenders created exotic mortgage options to cover buyers who didnt have cash for a downpayment or not enough income for the principal and interest, or ways to sidestep PMI. Many of these options have disappeared or are harder to get. You need to go back to the bank and get more information on your different options, or find a lender broker who will help you."

Having said that, there are many ICOs each month that will do very well in the future. The best thing to do is to shortlist a number of projects you like the sound of and then sit down and research each of them. Some of the key things to look out for, aside from whether you think the idea is a good one are The team. Do they have a proven track record? Are they reputable? Is what they claim provable? Google team member names and check to see if they have a legit Linkedin profile. The Whitepaper. Is it clearly worded without spelling and grammar mistakes? Does it have a well defined roadmap with provable achievements todate? The ICO format. How much are they looking to raise and is it a realistic figure? Are unsold tokens burnt? Is there a maximum contribution limit per investor? What does the competition look like? If they are first to market then this will make the startup way more attractive. The above are probably the most important things to consider though there are many other things to investigate. I have written a fairly comprehensive guide to all the things I look out for when analyzing the investability of an ICO.

    "topic": "Why do people buy stocks at higher price in merger?",
    "content": "There are kind of two answers here the practical reason an acquirer has to pay more for shares than their current trading price and the economic justification for the increase in price. Why must the acquirer must pay a premium as a practical matter? Everyone has a different valuation of a company. The current trading price is the lowest price that any holder of the stock is willing to sell a little bit of stock for and the highest that anyone is willing to buy a little bit for. However, Microsoft needs to buy a controlling share. To do this on the open market they would need to buy all the shares from people whos personal valuation is low, and then a bunch from people whose valuation is higher and so on. The act of buying that much stock would push the price up by buying all the shares from people who are really willing to sell. Moreover, as they buy more and more, the remaining people increase their personal valuation so the price would really shoot up. Acquirers avoid this situation by offering to buy a ton of stock at a substantially higher, single price. Why is Linkedin suddenly worth more than it was yesterday? Microsoft is expecting to be able to use its own infrastructure and tools to make more money with Linkedin than Linkedin would have before. In other words, they believe that the Linkedin division of Microsoft after the merger will be worth more than Linkedin alone was before the merger. This synergistic idea is the theoretical foundation for mergers in general and the main reason people use to argue for a higher price. You could also argue that by expressing an interest in Linkedin, Microsoft may be telling us something it knows about Linkedins value that maybe we didnt realize before because we arent as smart and informed as the people on Microsofts board. But since its Microsoft thats doing the buying in this case, Im going to go out on a limb and say this is not the main effect. Given Microsofts history, the idea that they buy expensive things because they have money to burn is more compelling than the idea that they have an insight into a companys value that we dont."

Much of that time Id only been interested in the quantity used  to measure my homes efficiency after certain upgrades  but in 2006 I also started tracking the \"Gas Supply Charge\" costs from my local utility, Enbridge, in Ontario, Canada. My numbers are for the gas commodity only i.e. excluding delivery and customer charges. Ive never been on a fixedprice contract, so the numbers are supposed to be reflective of market rates. However, the numbers do differ from real \"spot prices\" because Enbridge estimates gas costs upfront and then applies a \"gas cost adjustment\" at later dates if their estimate was wrong. Natural gas cost per cubic meter for Chriss home httpimg686.imageshack.usimg6866406naturalgascosts3priorye.png Since 2006, natural gas prices have been generally falling. The last cost I have on file, from my November 2009 bill, is 12.9 cents per cubic meter  being 20 cents gas supply rate, less gas cost adjustment of 7 cents. My average cost over that nearly 4 year period, January 2006 through November 2009, was 38.4 cents per cubic meter. Considering the current 5year fixed rate I found is about 29 cents per cubic meter, there is a substantial premium to locking in when compared to current market rates. However, one can see that during the last 4 years, market prices did substantially exceed that rate for quite some time. Furthermore, when I last looked at those 5year fixed rates perhaps a year or more ago, I couldnt find a company charging less than 39 cents per cubic meter. So, contract rates have fallen as well. Consequently, if we are at a natural gas price low and the economy is to recover, I tend to agree with Carts answer and suggest it could be a good time to consider a fixedrate contract. But, do your own due diligence and read the fine print if you go for it. UPDATE In the interest of full disclosure, shortly after I did my own research above, I signed up for my first ever fixedrate natural gas contract. "

Any investor worth his salt will ask a couple of questions what is my risk, and what is my gain? Paying off your student loans offers no financial risk at the cost of opportunity risk, and gains you returns of 3.4, 6.8, 3.4, 4.5, and 6.8. Those percentage gains are guaranteed and the opportunity risk is unknown. Investing in a startup is inherently risky, with the potential for big payoffs. But with this investment, you are accepting a lot of risk for potentially some gain it could be the next Apple, it could also fail.

    "content": "Your corporation would file a corporate income tax return on an annual basis. One single month of no revenue doesnt mean much in that annual scheme of things. Total annual revenue and total annual expenses are what impact the results. In other words, yes, your corporation can book revenues in say 11 of 12 months of the year but still incur expenses in all months. Many seasonal businesses operate this way and it is perfectly normal. You could even just have, say, one superawesome month and spend money the rest of the year. Heck, you could even have zero revenue but still incur expensesstartups often work like that at first. Youd need investment funding, personal credit, a loan, or retained earnings from earlier profitable periods to do that, of course. As long as your corporation has a reasonable expectation of a profit and the expenses your corporation incurs are valid business expenses, then yes, you ought to be able to deduct those expenses from your revenue when figuring taxes owed, regardless of whether the expenses were incurred at the same approximate time as revenue was bookedas long as the expense wasnt the acquisition of a depreciable asset. Some things your company would buysuch as the computer in your examplewould not be fully deductible in the year the expense is incurred. Depreciable property expenses are deducted over time according to a schedule for the kind of property. The amount of depreciation expense you can claim for such property each year is known as Capital Cost Allowance. A qualified professional accountant can help you understand this. One last thing You wrote \"write off\". That is not the same as \"deduct\". However, you are forgiven, because many people say \"write off\" when they actually mean \"deduct\" for tax purposes. \"Write off\", rather, is a different accounting term, meaning where you mark down the value of an asset e.g. a bad loan that will never be repaid to zero in effect, you are recognizing it is now a worthless asset. There can be a tax benefit to a writeoff, but what you are asking about are clearly expense deductions and not writeoffs. They are not the same thing, and the next time you hear somebody using \"write off\" when they mean \"deduction\", please correct them."

Presuming that youre asking the value of the company, the usual way for a publicly traded company to be valued is by the market capitalization 1. Market capitalization is a fairly simple measure, basically the total value of all the shares of stock in that company. You can find the market cap for any publicly traded company on any of the usual finance sites like Google Finance or Yahoo Finance. If by rich you mean the total value of assets assets being all property, including cash, real property, equipment, and licenses a company owns, that information is included in a publicly traded companys quarterly SEC filing and investor releases, but isnt usually listed on the popular finance sites. An example can be seen at Duke Energys Investor Relation Site the same information can be found for all companies on EDGAR, the SECs search tool. If you open the most recent 8K quarterly filing, and go to page 8, you can see that they have 33B in assets, and a high level breakdown of those. Note that the numbers are given in millions of dollars For a privately held company this information may or may not be available and youd have to track it down if it is available.

    "content": "Im currently working as an expat, and my grandparents used to work overseas but retired to Canada so you could say my family has done things completely the opposite of what you suggest. However there are a number of very good reasons that my grandparents have done things the way we have, and I think its worth sharing the rationale there. Lowcost moving to highcost is a nobrainer its not easy to do, but many people are trying nonetheless. However, even they will be likely to stay in the highcost countries, mostly because of health care, also safety is a factor, but social factors also matter. Firstly, I think two key factors that have been overlooked are language and health care most lowcost countries speak different languages than highcost countries. This isnt a problem if youre young, but it becomes prohibitive if you are older. Even if you can manage, its inconvenient in most countries. You cant just walk down the street and do whatever you like. You either have to keep a translator handy, or restrict your activities to places where you can communicate in your native language. Your favorite sports channels rugby, american football etc. might not be available, because nobody there cares. Your favorite news channel, or food even in grocery stores might not be so readily available. All these reasons made living abroad undesirable for my grandparents, but the big deal for them was healthcare. Outside of the US, every single developed economy has socialized healthcare to a large extent. When youre young it doesnt really matter, but when you are older, its a constant concern! There are two aspects to healthcare firstly, if you are a citizen in a developed country there are significant financial benefits In the US there is also medicaremedicaid but I dont know how those work so Im not going to talk about that to staying incountry when you retire, even if the health care would be more expensive its the government thats paying! Secondly, health care in lowcost countries tends to either be cheap and poor quality and by poor quality I mean really, really scary! or expensive and almost as good as a developed country. Again, highquality hospitals in lowcost countries may still save you money, but the nurses may not speak good English and the doctors may not have a great bedside manner. In many lowcost countries, nobody calls the police because they know the cops dont care, or will never solve the problem i.e. they will arrive hours or days after its too late, or the cops may even be in on it. So basically you try to protect yourself from the inevitable robbery,swindle,extortion,holdup,younameit but sooner or later something bad will happen. With security guards and being younger, its less of an issue, but when youre elderly, especially if you look foreign and rich, its definitely more dangerous. Many of my friends from lowincome countries try to emigrate for this reason andor in combination with the political climate, which is largely corrupt and full of problems. So, if youre old, why risk it? Stay somewhere safe."

My strategy if you could call it that is to simply let small amounts accumulate until theres enough to buy more shares without paying too much commission. For instance, I dont like fees to be more than 1 of the shares purchased, so with a 10 commission per trade, I prefer to make minimum 1000 purchases. I used to roll small amounts of cash into a noload money market fund I could buy without commission, and then purchase shares when I hit the threshold, but even putting the cash in a money market fund isnt worth the hassle today with rates of return from money market funds being close to zero."

    "content": "Here is a simple example of how daily leverage fails, when applied over periods longer than a day. It is specifically adjusted to be more extreme than the actual market so you can see the effects more readily. You buy a daily leveraged fund and the index is at 1000. Suddenly the market goes crazy, and goes up to 2000  a 100 gain! Because you have a 2x ETF, you will find your return to be somewhere near 200 if the ETF did its job. Then tomorrow it goes back to normal and falls back down to 1000. This is a fall of 50. If your ETF did its job, you should find your loss is somewhere near twice that 100. You have wiped out all your money. Forever. You lose.  The stock market does not, in practice, make jumps that huge in a single day. But it does go up and down, not just up, and if youre doing a daily leveraged ETF, your money will be gradually eroded. It doesnt matter whether its 2x leveraged or 8x leveraged or inverse 1x or anything else. Do the math, get some historical data, run some simulations. Youre right that it is possible to beat the market using a 2x ETF, in the short run. But the longer you hold the stock, the more ups and downs you experience along the way, and the more opportunity your money has to decay. If you really want to double your exposure to the market over the intermediate term, borrow the money yourself. This is why they invented the margin account Your broker will essentially give you a loan using your existing portfolio as collateral. You can then invest the borrowed money, increasing your exposure even more. Alternatively, if you have existing assets like, say, a house, you can take out a mortgage on it and invest the proceeds. This isnt necessarily a good idea, but its not really worse than a margin account investing with borrowed money is investing with borrowed money, and you might get a better interest rate. Actually, a lot of rich people who could pay off their mortgages dont, and invest the money instead, and keep the tax deduction for mortgage interest. But I digress. Remember that assets shrink liabilities loans never shrink. If you really want to double your return over the long term, invest twice as much money."

And then you factor in fees as others mentioned...

    "topic": "Best Time to buy a stock in a day ",
    "content": "You want to buy when the stock market is at an alltime low for that day. Unfortunately, you dont know the lowest time until the end of the day, and then you, uh cant buy the stock... Now the stock market is not random, but for your case, we can say that effectively, it is. So, when should you buy the stock to hopefully get the lowest price for the day? You should wait for 37 of the day, and then buy when it is lower than it has been for all of that day. Here is a quick example with fake data We have 18 points, and 37 of 18 is close to 7. So we discard the first 7 points  and just remember the lowest of those 7. We bear in mind that the lowest for the first 37 was 5. Now we wait until we find a stock which is lower than 5, and we buy at that point This system is optimal for buying the stock at the lowest price for the day. Why? We want to find the best position to stop automatically ignoring. Why 37? We know the answer to PBeing in position n  its 1N as there are N toilets, and we can select just 1. Now, what is the chance we select them, given were in position n? The chance of selecting any of the toilets from 0 to K is 0  remember were never going to buy then. So lets move on to the toilets from K1 and onwards. If K1 is better than all before it, we have this But, K1 might not be the best price from all past and future prices. Maybe K2 is better. Lets look at K2 For K2 we have KK1, for K3 we have KK2... So we have This is a close approximation of the area under 1x  especially as x   So 0  0  ...  KN x 1K  1K1  1K2 ...  1N1  KN x lnNK and so PK  KN x lnNK Now to simplify, say that x  KN We can graph this, and find the maximum point so we know the maximum PK  or we can use calculus. Heres the graph Heres the calculus To apply this back to your situation with the stocks, if your stock updates every 30 seconds, and is open between 0930 and 1600, we have 6.5 hours  390 minutes  780 refreshes. You should keep track of the lowest price for the first 289 refreshes, and then buy your stock on the next best price. Because x  KN, the chance of you choosing the best price is 37. However, the chance of you choosing better than the average stock is above 50 for the day. Remember, this method just tries to mean you dont loose money within the day  if you want to try to minimise losses within the whole trading period, you should scale this up, so you wait 37 of the trading period e.g. 37 of 3 months and then select. The maths is taken from Numberphile  Mathematical Way to Choose a Toilet. Finally, one way to lose money a little slower and do some good is with Kiva.org  giving loans to people is developing countries. Its like a bank account with a 1 interest  which is only 1 lower than a lot of banks, and you do some good. I have no affiliation with them."

    "content": "I am a realtor and work for Rausch Coleman and can answer this question for you. We are a production builder. We build in communities with typically 59 Floorplan options per community and a select set of option and finishes that we offer. Because of the set options, we buy the materials in bulk and are able to receive cost savings on that from our suppliers which we can pass on to you. We use the same trades consistently through out our division which means they have our plans and process down to a science. They know the product, which means less likely to make mistakes and less likely to miss things. Our heart is affordability in that we understand that not everyone can afford granite, gas, hardwood floors, etc. so we allow you to be able to customize your monthly payment, and that you are not financing something you may not want or need or to allow you to get in to a home you may not be able to afford otherwise. We work a lot with the first time buyer and we want to provide the best quality for the best value. We start our homes at a base model and allow you to customize the way you want adding granite, gas, hardwoods, fireplace, etc. and in doing that we allow you to choose whether you want to pay 90 or 101 per square foot or whatever that may be. I can tell you in Northwest Arkansas we are the best value and the quality shows. I pull comps consistently and in fact have another builder in the same community as I sell in. Our homes in this community for single stories is about 8895 and two story homes are on average 7886. Two stories are more cost efficient in that the square footage goes up and not out so there is less concrete, which is one of the most expensive parts of the homebuilding process. This other builder consistently sells their homes for 101105 per square foot, and uses the exact same materials we do. The difference? Yes granite and hardwoods and gas and custom cabinets come standard, you have no choice in that. Would you rather have the option for a lower priced home if you didnt want granite? Or if youd rather have carpet? We build in 5 different markets over 4 states and are in our 61st year of business. Id love to meet with you and can walk you through a community and show you our homes at all stages of construction where you can see the product and quality in our homes. I am in our Dixieland Crossing community here in Northwest Arkansas. You can check out our website for other information at www.rauschcoleman.com"

If you add an extended market index or just go with \"Total market\", that might be it for your stock allocation. Ive seen people with 5 funds, and it didnt take much analysis to see the overlap was so significant, that the extra 4 funds added little, and 2 of the 5 would have been it. If you diversify by buying more ETFs or funds, be sure to see what they contain. If you can go back in time, buy Apple, Google, Amazon, etc, and dont sell them. Individual stocks are fun to pick, but unless you put in your homework, are tough to succeed at. You need to be right at the buy side, and again to know if, and when, to sell. I bought Apple, for example, long ago, prelast few splits. But, using responsible a approach, I sold a bit each time it doubled. Has I kept it all through the splits, Id have 1M instead of the current 200K or so of stock. Can you tell which companies now have that kind of potential for the future? The SP has been just about double digit over 60 years. The average managed fund will lag the SP over time, many will be combined with other funds or just close. Even with huge survivor bias, managed funds cant beat the index over time, on average. Aside from a small portion of stocks Ive picked, Im happy to get SP less .02 in my 401k. In aggregate, people actually do far worse due to horrific timing and some odd thing, called emotions."

    "content": "I will use 10 of this 20K to pay the loan back on an annual basis agreement An annual payment of 0.8 2,000  250,000 is nowhere near large enough. The interest alone is going to be well over 10,000 and probably closer to 20,000 on an unsecured loan, so you need to plan for at least a 20,000  30,000 annual payment, depending on the terms length and interest rate on the loan. But in general... is this sustainablesafe? Essentially what you are doing is using leverage to increase the amount you can invest. While this is fantastic when the market rises, it can go horribly wrong when the market goes down. Generally it is unwise to fund a risky meaning there are large swings in return investment with a riskfree meaning youll always make a payment loan. If you want to see what could happen, forecast a 20 market drop and see what you are left with obviously youll need to make the loan payment out of your balance since you wont have any gains to pull from. An average of 1012 over a long period of time is reasonable, but the variance can cause the return to be anywhere from 40 to 40 in one year. Can you afford those losses? Heres an actual example If you were to invest 250,000 in the SP 500 in January 2000 with an 8 interestonly loan, your next three years returns would be After three years, assuming an interestonly payment of 20,000, your balance would be just over 100,000, youd still owe 250,000, and youd still be making 20,000 in interest payments. If your loan interest rate was 25 which is not unreasonable for an unsecured loan, youd be bankrupt after 3 years  youd still owe 250K but could not make the interest payment. No, this is not a good idea. The only time you should borrow money to invest in when you have control over the returns. So if you wanted to start your own business, had a stable business plan, and had much more certainty over the returns, the borrowing money might be plausible. But borrowing money to do passive investment is a huge mistake."

Walmart says that the price is going to reduce to 9 effective tomorrow. 4. You are inside the store buying almonds at 1159 PM. 5. Till you make your way up to the counter, it is already 1201 AM, so the store is technically shut. 6. However, they allow you to purchase the almonds since you were already in there. 7. You purchase the almonds at 9 since the day has changed. 8. So you have made a trade and it will reflect as a point on the graph. 9. When those points are joined, the curves on the graph will be created. 10. The data source is Walmarts system as it reflects the sale to you.  In your case the NYSE exchange records this trade made. Buying a stock is just like buying almonds. There has to be a buyer. There has to be a seller. There has to be a price to which both agree. As soon as all these conditions are met, and the trade is made, it is reflected on the graph. The only difference between the graphs from 9 AM4 PM, and 4 PM9 AM is the time. The trade has happened regardless and NYSEOr any other stock exchange has recorded it! The graph is just made from that data. Cheers."

    "content": "Keep in mind that the Federal Reserve Chairman needs to be very careful with his use of words. Heres what he said It is arguable that interest rates are too high, that they are being constrained by the fact that interest rates cant go below zero. We have an economy where demand falls far short of the capacity of the economy to produce. We have an economy where the amount of investment in durable goods spending is far less than the capacity of the economy to produce. That suggests that interest rates in some sense should be lower rather than higher. We cant make interest rates lower, of course. They only can go down to zero. And again I would argue that a healthy economy with good returns is the best way to get returns to savers. So what does that mean? When he says that \"we cant make interest rates lower\", that doesnt mean that it isnt possible. Hes saying that our demand for goods is lower than our ability to produce them. Negative interest would actually make that problem worse  if I know that things will cost less in a month, Im not going to buy anything. The Fed is incentivizing spending by lowering the cost of capital to zero. By continuing this policy, they are eventually going to bring on inflation, which will reduce the value of the currency  which gives people and companies that are sitting on money an disincentive to continue hoarding it."

How much capital would you need to get started? Are there things you can do now on a parttime basis to start this business or prepare you to start the business? Come up with a figure, find some mutual funds that have a low beta, and back out how much money you need to save per month, so you have around that total. Then you have a figure. e.g. Assume you need 20,000, and you find a fund that has done 8 over the past 20 years. Then, you would need to save about 110month to be ready to go in 10 years, or 273month to go in about 5 years. Its a time value of money calculation. The house is really a long way off, but you could do the same kind of calculation. I feel that you think your income, and possibly locale, will change dramatically over the next few years.

Either via appreciation ie, it hopefully increases value after you take all the fees and associated costs into account, you sell the investment, realise the gains or via a steady cashflow that, after you subtracted your costs, leaves you with a profit. Your primary residence is a roof over your head and first and foremost has the function of providing shelter for yourself and your family. It might go up in value, which is somewhat nice, but thats not its main purpose and for as long as you live in the house, you cannot realise the increase in value as you probably dont want to sell it. Of course the remortgage crowd would suggest that you can increase the size of the mortgage aka the home atm but a we all know how that movie ended and b youd have to factor in the additional interest in your PL calculation. You can also buy real estate as a pure investment, ie with the only objective being that you plan to make money on this. Normally youd buy a house or an apartment with a view of renting it out and try to increase your wealth both due to the assets appreciation hopefully and the rent, which in this scenario should cover the mortgage, all expenses and still leave you with a bit of profit. All that said, Ive never heard someone use the reasoning you describe as a reason not to buy a house and stay in an apartment  if you need a bigger place for your family and can afford to buy something bigger, that falls under the shelter provision and not under the investment."

Your trading strategyreasoning for your covered call notwithstanding, in your case, as an option writer covering in the money calls, you want to hold and pray that your option expires worthless. As I said in the other answer, there is always a theoretical premium of option price  exercise price to underlying prices, no matter how slight, right up until expiration, so on that basis, it doesnt pay to close out the option. However, theres a reality that I didnt mention in the other answer if its a deep in the money option, you can actually put a bid  stock price  exercise price  trade fee and hope for the best since the market makers rarely bid above stock price  exercise price for illiquid options, but its unlikely that youll beat the market makers  hft. Theyre systems are too fast. I know the philly exchange allows you to put in implied volatility orders, but theyre expensive, and I couldnt tell you if a brokerexchange allows for dynamic orders with the equation I specified above, but it may be worth a shot to check out however, its unlikely that such a low order would ever be filled since youll at best be lined up with the market makers, and it would require a big player dumping all its holdings at once to get to your order. If youre doing a traditional, trueblue covered call, theres absolutely nothing wrong being assigned except for the tax implications. When your counterparty calls away your underlyings, it is a sell for tax purposes. If youre not covering with the underlying but with a more complex spread, things could get hairy for you real quick if someone were to exercise on you, but thats always a risk. If your broker is extremely strict, they may close the rest of your spread for you at the offer. In illiquid markets, that would be a huge percentage loss considering the wide bidask spreads."

    "topic": "How to use proceeds of old house sale shortly after buying new house?",
    "content": "Ive heard that the bank may agree to a \"one time adjustment\" to lower the payments on Mortgage 2 because of paying a very large payment. Is this something that really happens? Its to the banks advantage to reduce the payments in that situation. If they were willing to loan you money previously, they should still be willing. If they keep the payments the same, then youll pay off the loan faster. Just playing with a spreadsheet, paying off a third of the mortgage amount would eliminate the back half of the payments or reduces payments by around two fifths leaving off any escrow or insurance. If you can afford the payments, Id lean towards leaving them at the current level and paying off the loan early. But you know your circumstances better than we do. If you are underfunded elsewhere, shore things up. Fully fund your 401k and IRA. Fill out your emergency fund. Buy that new appliance that you dont quite need yet but will soon. If you are paying PMI, you should reduce the principal down to the point where you no longer have to do so. Thats usually more than 20 equity or less than an 80 loan. There is an argument for investing the remainder in securities stocks and bonds. If you itemize, you can deduct the interest on your mortgage. And then you can deduct other things, like local and state taxes. If youre getting a higher return from securities than youd pay on the mortgage, it can be a good investment. Five or ten years from now, when your interest drops closer to the itemization threshold, you can cash out and pay off more of the mortgage than you could now. The problem is that this might not be the best time for that. The Buffett Indicator is currently higher than it was before the 20079 market crash. That suggests that stocks arent the best place for a medium term investment right now. Id pay down the mortgage. You know the return on that. No matter what happens with the market, it will save you on interest. Id keep the payments where they are now unless they are straining your budget unduly. Pay off your thirty year mortgage in fifteen years."

    "content": "That is a loaded question but Ill give it a shot. First things first you need to determine if you are ready to invest in stocks. If you have a lot of high interest debt you would be much better served paying that off before investing in stocks. Stocks return around 810 in the long run, so youd be better off paying off any debt you have that is higher than 810. Most people get their start investing in stocks through mutual funds in their 401k or a Roth IRA. If you want to invest in individual stocks instead of mutual funds then you will need to do a lot of reading and learning. You will need a brokerage account or if you have a stock in mind they might have a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP that you could invest in directly with the company. You will have to compare the different brokerage firms to determine which is best for you. Since you seem to be internet savvy, I suggest you use a discount brokerage that lets you buy stocks online with cheaper commissions. A good rule of thumb is to keep commissions below 1 of the amount invested. Once you have your online brokerage account open with money in there the process of actually buying the stock is fairly straightforward. Just place an order for the amount of shares you want. That order can be a market order which means the purchase will occur at the current market price. Or you can use a limit order where you control at what price your purchase will occur. There are lots of good books out there for beginners. Personally I learned from the Motley Fool. And last but not least is to have fun with it. Learn as much as you can and welcome to the club."

    "topic": "Why is company provided health insurance tax free, but individual health insurance is not?",
    "content": "During World War II, the United States US instituted wage and price controls. To attract better employees, companies would offer benefits to get around salary limits. Health insurance was one of the more successful benefits. At that time, income taxes were newer and there were many ways to evade them. Companies could generally deduct expenses. So at that time, health care was deductible because everything was. And at that time, only wages were taxable compensation from employer to employee. Since that time, many other benefits have become nondeductible for employers, e.g. housing or the reduced deduction for meals and entertainment. But health care is generally regarded as different, as a necessity. While everyone needs to eat, not everyone needs to eat at a 100 a meal restaurant. People who need expensive health care really need it. People who eat expensive food just prefer it. And of course, health care is more intermittent where food is relatively consistent. You dont need ten thousand calories one day and zero the next. But some families have no health care expenses in a year while another might have cancer or a pregnancy. Note that medical care expenses can be deducted for individuals if they are large enough in aggregate and you itemize. And of course both businesses and workers have incentives to maintain the current system with deductibility. Health insurance is a common benefit. Housing is not although its worth noting that travel housing and meals are deductible. So there have been few people impacted by making housing taxable while many people would be impacted by taxable health insurance. You can deduct health insurance costs if selfemployed. Its also not true that health insurance is the only benefit with preferential tax treatment. Retirement and child care are also deductible. Even meals and housing can be deducted in certain circumstances. The complex rules about what and how much is deductible. There have been rumbles about normalizing the tax treatment of health insurance and medical care, but there is a lot of opposition. Insurance companies oppose making all healthcare expenses deductible, as that reduces their effective benefit. They would prefer only insurance premiums be deductible. Traditionally employed individuals oppose making health insurance taxable, as that would increase their taxes. So the situation persists. There isnt quite enough support to move in either direction, although the current compromise is economically silly."

It would make sense if you wanted the money only in x years, and couldnt afford to lose say 20 or more if the stock market crashed the day before you needed the cash. Typically if you are about to retire and buy an annuity, you want to protect your capital. This isnt you. At 28, you might be saving for a wedding, a deposit on a house, possibly for school fees, or for eventual retirement. It doesnt sound like you need to get back exactly 24k in July 2022. Keep the 6 months expenses in accounts that you can withdraw from at short notice. Some of this in a current account, some might be in a savings account that doesnt pay interest if you make withdrawals. After that, Id stick most of the rest in stock market tracker funds, but you might go for actively managed funds instead ask another question and take professional advice, there will presumably be local tax considerations too, and add in most of your monthly savings too. These should beat the 2.3 over the 5 years, and you can liquidate them easily if you want to buy a house. If there is a recession and a stock market dip, you presumably have the flexibility to hold on to them longer for the economy to recover. And if you are intending to buy a house, then a recession will probably also involve a fall in house prices, so the loss in your savings will be somewhat balanced by the drop in the purchase price of your house. Of course, the worst case scenario is a severe downturn where you lose your job, are unemployed for a considerable period of time, burn through your emergency fund, and need to sell shares at a considerable loss to meet your expenses. You might have family or dependents that you can borrow from or would need to support, which would change your tolerance for risk. Having money locked away for 5 years in this scenario is even worse. So if you dont want to put all your nonemergency savings into the stock market, you still want to choose something that is accessible at a slightly lower interest rate. But ultimately it sounds like you can afford to lose some of your savings, and the probability is that you will be rewarded with much better returns than 2.3 over 5 years."

    "content": "Wow, I cannot believe this is a question. Of course reading the 10Ks and 10Qs from the SEC are incredibly beneficial. Especially if you are a follower of the investing gurus such as Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Shelby Davis. Personally I only read the 10Ks I copy the pertinent numbers over to my spreadsheets so I can compare multiple companies that I am invested in. Im sure there are easier ways to obtain the data. Im a particular user of the discounted free cash flow methodology and buyingselling in thirds. I feel like management that says what they are going to do and does it over a period of years is something that cannot be underestimated in investing. yes, there are slipups, but those tend to be well documented in the 10Qs. I totally disagree in the efficient market stuff. I tend to love using methodologies like Hewitt Heisermans \" Its Earnings that Count\" you cannot do his powerstaircase without digging into the 10Qs. by using his methodology I have several 5 baggers over the last 5 years and Im confident that Ill have more. I think it is an interesting factoid as well that the books most recommended for investing in stocks on Amazon all advocate reading and getting information from 10Ks. The other book to read is Peter Lynchs oneupwallstreet. The fact is money managers hands are tied when it comes to investing, especially in small companies and learning over the last 6 years how to invest on my own has given me that much more of my investing money back rather than paying it to some money manager doing more trades than they should to get commision fees."

It is the date where all changes to registration details must be finalised. Ex dividend date The ex dividend date occurs two business days before the companys Record Date. To be entitled to a dividend a shareholder must have purchased the shares before the ex dividend date. If you purchase shares on or after that date, the previous owner of the shares and not you is entitled to the dividend.

In my area, a 500K home could easily have over 10K in total property taxes. Many of these services are for things that you need or might even want such as parks and libraries. In any case, they must be funded and property taxes are the most prevalent way of doing that. I was once told that you never actually own property because if you dont pay the property taxes, they will take the property away. By the way, property taxes are not the only expenses that you may have overlooked. You need to have insurance on your house to cover fire, theft, storm damage, and injuries to persons visiting you. In some areas, flood insurance may also be required. You should also budget for repairs and maintenance. Eventually you will need to replace major items like roofs, appliances and heatingcooling equipment. Dont underestimate the cost of maintaining a lawn if you have one.

As keshlam noted in a comment, this income is coming on top of whatever else you earn, so it will be taxed at your top rate. Finally, Id check again whether this is really \"hobby\" income or if it is \"selfemployment\" income. Selfemployment income will be subject to selfemployment tax, which comes on top of the regular income tax."

Who has the money? The banks, who else. I have found that some banks are capable of sendingreceiving ACH transfers faster than others. I have accounts in two banks, lets call them A and B. If I send money push from A to B, it may take several days. But if I decide to pull the money from A to B by originating the transaction through my account at B  the money arrives the next day! So the actual transfer only takes a night, one business day. Its just the direction that matters  if the bank has to give the money out, it will do all it can including taking 23 days for \"processing\" to keep the money as long as possible. But when another bank charges them  they have no choice but to pay. By the way, bank B behaves better  when I send the money from my account at B, it arrives to A the next day as well. Try a similar experiment. Instead of originating the transaction at the sender bank  try to originate it at the receiver bank, see how long it takes then for the money to appear on your account after it disappeared from the other one."

Buying a home as a primary residence really isnt \"investing in real estate\" per se. Its buying a place to live rather than renting one. Unless you rent a room out or get a multifamily unit, your primary residence wont be incomeproducing. It will be incomedraining, for the most part. I speak as a homeowner. Second, if you are buying to rent out to someone else, buying a single home is quite a bit different than buying an REIT. The home is a lot less liquid, the transaction costs are higher, and all of your eggs are in one basket.

    "content": "[...] are all bonds priced in such a way so that they all return the same amount on average, after accounting for risk? In other words, do risk premiums ONLY compensate for the amount investors might lose? No. GE might be able to issue a bond with lower yield than, say, a company from China with no previous records of its presence in the U.S. markets. A bond price not only contains the risk of default, but also encompasses the servicability of the bond by the issuer with a specific stream of income, location of main business, any specific terms and conditions in the prospectus, e.g.callable or not, insurances against default, etc. Else for the same payoff, why would you take a higher risk? The payoff of a higher risk not only default, but term structure, e.g. 5 years or 10 years, coupon payments bond is more, to compensate for the extra risk it entails for the bondholder. The yield of a high risk bond will always be higher than a bond with lower risk. If you travel back in time, to 20112012, you would see the yields on Greek bonds were in the range of 2530, to reflect the high risk of a Greek default. Some hedge funds made a killing by buying Greek bonds during the eurozone crisis. If you go through the Efficient frontier theory, your argument is a counter statement to it. Same with individual bonds, or a portfolio of bonds. You always want to be compensated for the risk you take. The higher the risk, the higher the compensation, and vice versa. When investors buy the bond at this price, they are essentially buying a \"risk free\" bond [...] Logically yes, but no it isnt, and you shouldnt make that assumption."

    "topic": "Why do people buy stocks at higher price in merger?",
    "content": "Without any highly credible anticipation of a company being a target of a pending takeover, its common stock will normally trade at what can be considered noncontrol or \"passive market\" prices, i.e. prices that passive securities investors pay or receive for each share of stock. When there is talk or suggestion of a publicly traded companys being an acquisition target, it begins to trade at \"control market\" prices, i.e. prices that an investor or group of them is expected to pay in order to control the company. In most cases control requires a wouldbe control shareholder to own half a companys total votes not necessarily stock plus one additional vote and to pay a greater price than passive market prices to noncontrol investors and sometimes to other control investors. The difference between these two market prices is termed a \"control premium.\" The appropriateness and value of this premium has been upheld in case law, with some conflicting opinions, in Delaware Chancery Court see the reference below LinkedIn Corp. is incorporated in the state, most other US states courts and those of many countries with active stock markets. The amount of premium is largely determined by investment bankers who, in addition to applying other valuation approaches, review most recently available similar transactions for premiums paid and advise formally in an \"opinion letter\" their clients what range of prices to pay or accept. In addition to increasing the likelihood of being outbid by a thirdparty, failure to pay an adequate premium is often grounds for class action lawsuits that may take years to resolve with great uncertainty for most parties involved. For a recent example and more details see this media opinion and overview about Dell Inc. being taken private in 2013, the lawsuits that transaction prompted and the courts ruling in 2016 in favor of passive shareholder plaintiffs. Though it has more to do with determining fair valuation than specifically premiums, the case illustrates instruments and means used by some courts to protect noncontrol, passive shareholders.  REFERENCE As a reference, in a 2005 note written by a major USbased international corporate law firm, it noted with respect to Delaware courts, which adjudicate most major shareholder conflicts as the state has a disproportionate share of large companies in its domicile, that control premiums may not necessarily be paid to minority shareholders if the acquirer gains control of a company that continues to have minority shareholders, i.e. not a full acquisition Delaware case law is clear that the value of a dissenting [target companys] stockholders shares is not to be reduced to impose a minority discount reflecting the lack of the stockholders control over the corporation. Indeed, this appears to be the rationale for valuing the target corporation as a whole and allocating a proportionate share of that value to the shares of [a] dissenting stockholder [exercising his appraisal rights in seeking to challenge the value the target companys board of directors placed on his shares]. At the same time, Delaware courts have suggested, without explanation, that the value of the corporation as a whole, and as a going concern, should not include a control premium of the type that might be realized in a sale of the corporation."

A good year could increase your capital a bit, but a bad year can devastate it, and you would not have the time to wait for the good years to average it out.

Look at the chart referenced in the link in your question. It took approximately 50 years for annual production of gold to double from 500 tons to 1000 tons. It took approximately 40 years for annual production to double from 1000 tons to 2000 tons. Compare that to the production of US dollars by the Federal Reserve see chart below obtained from here. US dollar production doubled in DAYS. Which one do you think will lead to uncontrolled inflationdeflation? Update Why did I include a chart of the FEDs balance sheet? Because this is the way newly printed money is introduced  the FED will purchase something from banks mortgagebacked securities, US treasuries, etc. with newly printed money. The banks can then loan this money to people who then deposit the money into other banks who loan those deposits to other people and so on. This is how the fractional reserve process expands the money supply. This is why I did not include a chart of the money supply since that is counting the same money multiple times. If I deposited 100 newly minted coins into a bank and that bank proceeded to loan out 80 of my coins where 80 are deposited into another bank who then proceeds to loan out 60 of the coins, and so on....the production of coins only changed by the initial 100 that I minted  not by the fractional reserve multiple.

There is a full length of scam plans, like sending you false checks to deposit and ask you withdrew money to send them back to even having very big incoming transaction to your account sitting idle on your account which might originate from a crime beyond the financial domain. You can try to be smart, thinking in mind, well, let them send some, I will never send them back before bank declare the deposited checks got horned and clear and send back the amount after keeping your share.

Still you will not have any valid authority or answer describing howwhy you got this money if someone ask you later. Depending on scammers ability, they might even give you control over fund to spend for your own to gain some trust from your part. On this type of scam it is a sign of an even bigger danger. I live such a country, Bangladesh, from where recently they successfully transferred out around US10 millions using a bank account of an outsider like you keeping in between source of money and final unknown destination. The result is the owner  operator of those accounts used for these transfers are now under law enforcement pressure, not only just to find out where ultimately money has gone, but for sure they will face some degree of charge for helping transfer of illegal money overseas\". For someone who is not part of a full scam chain it is a big deal. It might ruin their life forever. To be on the safe side, and help protect others from falling on the same type of problem you may contact your local law enforcement agency. Depending on the situation, they might be interested to run a sting operation using your information and support to catch and stop the crime going to happen soon or later.

In the specific example of car insurance, you may be missing that it doesnt only cover replacement of the car, it also covers liability, which is a hundredsofthousandsofdollars risk. The liability coverage may well be legally required it may also be required as a base layer if you want to get a separate umbrella policy up to millions in liability. So you have to be very rich before this insurance stops making sense. In the US at least you can certainly buy car insurance that doesnt cover loss of the car, or that has a high deductible. And in fact, if you can afford to selfinsure up to a high deductible, on average as you say that should be a good idea. Same is true of most kinds of insurance, a high deductible is best as long as you can afford it, unless you know youll probably file a claim. Health insurance in particular is weird in many ways, and one is that you often can estimate whether youll have claims. On our auto policy, the liability and uninsured motorist coverage is about 60 of the cost while damage to the car coverage is 40. Im sure this varies a lot depending on the value of your cars and how much you drive and driving record, etc. On an aging car the coverage for the car itself should get cheaper and cheaper since the car is worth less, while liability coverage would not necessarily get cheaper."

This wont necessarily get you the best price, but it will get you, on the whole, a good price and will enable you to increase your holdings over time. If youre doing frequent trading on a highly volatile stock, you dont want to use this method. A better strategy is to buy the dips Know the range, and place limit orders toward the bottom of the range. Then place limit orders to sell toward the high end of the range. If you do it right, you might be able to build up enough money to buy and sell increasing numbers of shares over time. But like any frequent trader, youll have to deal with transaction fees youll need to be sure the fees dont eat all your profit."

    "content": "tldr I think you can find a much better deal. Doing a strait refi will cost you some amount of money. However, a 2.5 fee ont top of closing costs seems really high. You can get a quote from Quicken loans pretty quick and compare their fee. Also I would check with a local bank, preferably one you already do business with. The 2.5 is probably their commission for originating the loan. If you are in the Southeast I have had great luck with Regions bank. They are large enough, but also small enough. Please know that I have no affiliation with either company. BTW the rate also seems high. Doing a quick search of Bank Rate, it seems you can get 3.25 with zero fee as of this writing. The worse deal they show is 3.46 with a .75 fee, much better than you were quoted. If you can afford it I would also encourage you to think outside the box. A client of mine was able to obtain a Home Equity Loan not line of credit to replace their mortgage. They went for a 7 year pay off, with the loan in first position, at a rate about .75 below the then current 15 year rate. The key was there was zero closing costs. It saved them quite a bit of money. Also look at a 10 year fixed. It might not be much more than you are paying now."

    "topic": "Why dont boards of directors try to produce results in line with estimates?",
    "content": "First off, some companies do something like this. Microsoft for example was wellknown for consistently hitting earnings estimates every quarter  nearly never missed them, and most of the time didnt exceed by much either. In order to do this and not be prosecuted for accounting fraud, you typically have to be a service or nontangible good company like Microsoft used to be where you can manipulate the amount of product on hand and move costs fairly easily from one quarter to the next. A company like, say, Home Depot or Caterpillar  both of which have tangible goods theyre either retailing or producing  has less flexibility there, although they will still try to move profits around to match earnings estimates more closely. However, you have to be consistently doing well to be able to do this. You cant manufacture additional total revenue so if you have one down quarter, you have to either have moved some revenue into it from the previous quarter, or you have to be able to move some into it from the next quarter. That obviously doesnt work consistently unless youre a fastgrowing company, or have an extremely stable base. Its also hard to do this in a legalseeming fashion  technically this sort of manipulation is illegal, so decisions have to be justifiable. Companies like Microsoft that are expanding can also do things to encourage slightly lower expectations. A company in need of a stock price bump issues press releases touting its inventions and products as amazing things that will drive profits through the roof and an aggressive profit forecast  just as easy to issue a press release with a conservative forecast, meaning the bar will be lower to hit. Its also not really necessary to manipulate earnings to have a consistently wellperforming stock. This article for example shows that companies who miss earnings estimates dont really suffer much when controlling for their actual earnings changes, of course in the long run. Your price might drop a bit, but if your company is otherwise sound, it will recover. Finally, companies do sometimes come out with information ahead of earnings that cause expectations to be lowered. 7Eleven for example just lowered its earnings expectations due to various reasons. Some companies choose to do this in order to dilute the effect on the market. Im not sure if this is ever required, but it seems to me that some companies are much quicker to restate earnings expectations than others."

I borrowed money twice, once for a school loan that was countersigned, and once for my mortgage. In both cases my application was accepted. You only need to have \"good credit\" if you want to borrow money. Credit scores are usually only relevant for people with irregular income or a past history of delinquency. Assuming the debtor has no history of delinquency, the only thing the bank really cares about is the income level of the applicant. In the old days it could be difficult to rent a car without a credit car and this was the only major problem for me before about 2010. Usually I would have to make a cash deposit of 400 or something like that before a rental agency would rent me a car.

In case of Microsoft their stock price and dividend will not be controlled solely by that one product they make but also by their many other products plus a billion other factors which can influence a stock price. So when you want to bet specifically on the success of Windows Phone then betting on the Microsoft Corporation as a whole might not achieve that goal. However, you can also try to find companies whose success depends indirectly on the success of the product. That can be suppliers someone who makes a specific part which is only used for Windows phones, companies which make Windows Phone specific accessories or software developers who make applications which specifically target the Windows Phone ecosystem. When the product portfolio of these companies is far narrower than that of Microsoft they might be more dependent on the success of Windows Phone than Microsoft themselves. But as always, keep in mind that the success of their products is not the only factor which decides the stock value of a company. The stock market is far more complex than that."

One problem is that inflation is always backwardslooking, while investment returns are always forwardlooking. There are ways to calculate an expected rate of inflation from foreign exchange futures and other market instruments, though. That said, when comparing investments, typically all investments are in the same currency, so the effect of inflation is the same, and inflation makes no difference in a comparative analysis.

This is a personal opinion but I prefer investment types that dont have another fee on access. I really dont like having another fee on top on money that I need right now. Investment Options Market based investments should be seen as long term investments, therefore they do not really satisfy requirement one, they can also have broker fees, therefore you might pay a small extra charge for taking money out, and so do not satisfy requirement two. Investment Options for Emergency Funds You want to get the best return on your money even if its your emergency fund. So use regular saving accounts, but from you emergency fund or use tax effective savings accounts, like a cash ISA if based in the UK. Dont think of an emergency money as just sitting there, you have options just makes sure the options fit the requirements. UPDATE Given feedback I appreciate there are levels of emergency fund, the above details things which might be about 12 month salary in cost, car repairs, leaks, boiler repairs. Now I have another fund which is in P2P funds which is higher risk than a deposit account but then gives me a better return and is less subject to market fluctuations and it would be the place I go to for loss of job level emergencies say 6 months of salary, this takes a bit longer to access but given I have the above emergency fund I have given myself time to get the money from the P2P account."

Every day researchers update their models based on the past performance of each indicator. All this is just too much work to be done manually. Firms use machine learning methods to understand markets. They try to figure out what is normal, what did not happen correctly at a specific time, what will happen in future. For instance, they use deep learning networks to look at unlabeled data, and figure out what is normal and what is not. These networks can analyze an unstructured haystack of noise, and separate out the signal. This is very relevant to finance and markets because finding the patterns and anomalies in market data has been the bread and butter of traders for decades. Deep learning networks give us applications like feature learning. By features, Im referring to certain attributes in data that indicate an event.

They really only represent themselves other investors may decide that the stock is worth more or less than that. The stock price can move on very little volume. In this case, Amazon had released a very good earnings report after the bell yesterday, and the price jumped in after hours trading. The stock price is up, but that simply means that the few shares traded overnight sold for much higher than the closing price yesterday. After the market opens today and many more shares are traded, well get a better idea what large numbers of investors feel about the price.

This means the company issued fairly risky, fairly highyield debt, to buy out equity holders.

What is a junk bond and how does it differ from a regular bond? Its only a matter of degree and nomenclature. A bond that has a credit rating below a particular level eg SP BBB is called junk, or more politely \"noninvestment grade\" or \"speculative\". Its possible for an existing bond to be reclassified from one side to another, or for a single issuer to have different series some of which are more risky than others. The higher the perceived risk, the more interest the bond must pay offer in order to attract lenders. Why is there higher riskchance of default?

The Fed raises money from the markets by issuing Tresury Bonds at a specified rate. This rate at which it raises money varies depening on the economy. Thus there are 2 rates the rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed, which is higher than the rate that the Fed would give banks for excess money deposited with them. So if the cost of borrowing is less, banks can borrow this money from the Fed and loan it to individuals at a slightly higher rate that would cover their costs plus a small profit. The risk associated with a mortgage is less, and hence these would be cheaper, then say a personal loan. If the cost of borrowing goes up, the mortgage rate will go up. If the cost of borrowing money goes down, the cost would come down. Banks may not always borrow money to lend. If they have existing money, they can either park it with the Fed for a lower interest rate, or loan it to individuals for a rate higher than what they would have received from the Fed."

    "content": "The calculation of an insurance premium involves several factors, making it somewhat complex but ultimately based on the insurers assessment of your risk as a policyholder. Heres a breakdown of the key elements 1. Base Rate This forms the foundation of your premium and is determined by the type of insurance youre seeking e.g., car, health, home. It reflects the inherent risk associated with that category, considering historical data and claim frequency. 2. Risk Factors These are personal characteristics or circumstances that influence your individual risk profile and can adjust your premium up or down from the base rate. Common examples include Age Younger drivers or individuals with certain health conditions might see higher premiums. Location Areas with higher crime rates or natural disaster risks might lead to increased premiums. Claims history A history of filing claims can indicate a higher risk and result in higher premiums. Driving record Traffic violations or accidents can increase car insurance premiums. Property features Newer homes with safety features might attract lower premiums compared to older ones. Coverage amount Choosing a higher sum insured for your belongings or property naturally increases the premium. 3. Additional Considerations Discounts Insurers might offer discounts for various factors like bundling multiple policies, opting for safety features, or maintaining a clean driving record. Company Expenses Operational costs, marketing, and agent commissions also factor into the final premium calculation. Putting it Together Imagine the base rate as a starting point. Each risk factor acts like a slider, moving the premium up or down based on your specific profile. Discounts can then bring the premium down further, while company expenses add to the final figure. Remember The exact calculation method varies between insurers, and their proprietary models might consider other factors. Its important to compare quotes from different insurers to find the best combination of coverage and price based on your individual risk profile. While a lower premium might be tempting, ensure the coverage adequately reflects your needs to avoid being underinsured in case of a claim."

Thats not the way modern banking works. Today and for a long, long time banks will keep only a small fraction of their deposits on hand called the \"reserve\" to fund daily withdrawals and other operations. The rest they routinely lend out to other customers, which is how they pay for their operations someone has to pay all those tellers, branch managers, loan officers and pay interest on your deposits, as well as a profit for their owners its not a charity service. The fees charged for loan origination, as well as the difference between the loan interest rate and the deposit rate, make up the profit. Banks rarely hold their own loans. Instead, they will sell the loans in portfolios to investors, sometimes retaining servicing rights they continue to collect the payments and pass them on and sometimes not the payments are now due to someone else. This allows them to make more loans. Banks may sometimes not have enough capital on hand. In this case, they can make interbank loans to meet their shortterm needs. In some cases, theyll take those loans from a government central bank. In the US, this is \"The Fed\", or the Federal Reserve Bank. In the US, back around the late 1920s, and again in the 1980s some banks experienced a \"run\", or a situation where people lost confidence in the bank and wanted to withdraw their money. This caused the bank to have insufficient funds to support the withdrawals, so not everyone got their money. People panicked, and others wanted to take their money out, which caused the situation to snowball. This is how many banks failed. In the 80s, it was savingsandloans that failed  still a kind of \"bank\". Today, we have the FDIC Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to protect depositors. In the crashes in the early 2000s, many banks closed up one night and opened the next in a conservatorship, and then were literally doing business as a new bank without depositors necessarily even knowing.

    "content": "Theres a significant difference between \"discount\" and \"surcharge\". For starters  legal difference. If you have a list price of X  thats the price youre committed to sell regardless of the payment method. So it doesnt matter if I pay with cash or credit  Ill pay X. However, it costs you more when I pay with credit  so you want to pass that cost on me. You charge me surcharge  an addition to the price. In some States in the US and in some other countries  that is against the law. You cannot add on top of the listed price any amount regardless of the payment method. However, you can say that the list price is X, which includes the assumed credit card surcharge of Y. And then you give discount of Y to anyone not paying with credit card. The list price is still X, regardless of the payment method. You dont have to give the discount, the discount is your cost of doing business. But that would be legal in some places not all! that forbid credit card surcharge. So the main difference from legal perspective is that youre not allowed to add to the list price, but youre allowed to discount from it. Regarding taxes  exemptiondeduction is not a penalty for negative. Exemptiondeduction is an implementation of a social policy. For example, it is for the public benefit for everyone to own a house. So the Congress comes up with a deduction of mortgage interest. However, youre not penalized if you dont own a house by paying higher taxes. Your tax rate doesnt change. You just dont get to deduct something that you might be able to deduct had you owned a house with a mortgage. This is, again  a discount of a list price, not a surcharge. Youre not penalized if you dont have a house or dont have a mortgage, but if you do  you get a break. The author youre quoting claims that bottom line would be the same as if you considered the absence of a deduction as a penalty. But thats not true, because even if you do have a mortgage you may not be able to deduct it because your income is too high, the mortgage is for too much, or your mortgage is not on the primary residence. So mere existence of the mortgage doesnt directly correlate to the existence of the deduction. Similarly with credit card surcharges  you may get a cash discount, but you may get the similar amount of money back even if you use a credit card. Not as a cash discount but rather as rewards, cashbacks or points. However, if theres no cash discount, you wont be getting these if youre paying cash. So again  youre not penalized for having a credit card by not getting a discount, because you may still get it in a different way  and if you dont, you still may end up not getting it. So the quote is a rather simplistic and negative view and more of an opinion than stating a fact."

    "content": "I would say similar rules apply in the US. If you have a net loss from rental property, you certainly can claim that loss against your personal income. There are various rules around this though that make it a bit less clear cut. If you are a \"real estate professional\", which basicly means you spend at least 750 hours per year working on your rental properties or related activities, then all losses are deductible against any other ordinary income you have. If you arent a \"real estate professional\", then your rental income is considered a \"passive activity\" and losses you can count against regular income are limited to 25,000 per year with a carryforward provision and begin to phase out entirely if your income is between 100,000 and 150,000. So, the law here is structured to allow most smalltime investors to take rental real estate losses against their ordinary income, but the income phaseout provision is designed to prevent the wealthy from using rental property losses to avoid taxation."

    "content": "This may be a great idea, or a very bad one, or it may simply not be applicable to you, depending on your personal circumstances and interests. The general idea is to avoid passive investments such as stocks and bonds, because they tend to grow by \"only\" a few percent per year. Instead, invest in things where you will be actively involved in some form. With those, much higher investment returns are common but also the risk is higher, and you may be tied down and have to limit the traveling you want to do. So here are a few different ways to do that Get a college degree, but only if you are interested in the field, and it ends up paying you well. If you arent interested in the field, you wont land the 100k jobs later. And if you study earlychildhood education, you may love the job, but it wont pay enough to make it a good investment. Of course, it also has to fit with your life plans, but that might be easier than it seems. You want to travel. Have you thought about anthropology, marine biology or archeology? Pick a reputable, hardtogetinto, academic school rather than a vocationoriented oe, and make sure that they have at least some research program. Thats one way to distinguish between the forprofit schools who tend to be very expensive and land you in lowpaying jobs, and schools that actually lead to a wellpaying future. Or if your interest runs more in a different direction start a business. Your best bet might be to buy a franchise. Many of the fastfood chains, such as McDonalds, will let you buy as long as you have around 300k net worth. Most franchises also require that you are qualified. It may often make sense to buy not just one franchised store, but several in an area. You can increase your income and your risk by getting a loan  you can probably buy at least 5 million worth of franchises with your \"seed money\". BTW, Im only using McDonalds as an example. Wellknown fast food franchises used to be moneymaking machines, but their popularity may well have peaked. There are franchises in all kinds of industries, though. Some tend to be very shortterm there is a franchise based on selling customers stuff on ebay, while others can be very longlived many realestate brokerages are actually franchises. Do be careful which ones you buy. Some can be a \"license to print money\" while others may fail, and there are some fraudsters in the franchising market, out to separate you from your money. Advantage over investing in stocks and bonds if you choose well, your return on investment can be much higher. Thats generally true for any business that you get personally involved in. If you do well, you may well end up retiring a multimillionaire. Drawback you will be exposed to considerable risk. The investment will be a major chunk of your net worth, and you may have to put all your eggs in none basket. If your business fails, you may lose everything. A third option but only if you have a real interest in it! get a commercial drivers license and buy an 18wheeler truck. I hear that owneroperators can easily make well over 100k, and thats with having to pay off a bank loan. But if you dont love trucker culture, it is likely not worth doing. Overall, you probably get the idea the principle is to use your funds as seed money to launch something profitable and secure, as well as enjoyable for you."

    "topic": "Pros  cons in Hungary of investing retirement savings exclusively in silver? What better alternatives, given my concerns?",
    "content": "Like Jeremy T said above, silver is a value store and is to be used as a hedge against sovereign currency revaluations. Since every single currency in the world right now is a freefloating fiat currency, you need silver or some other firm, easily storeable, protectable, transportable asset class e.g. gold, platinum, ... whatever... in order to protect yourself against government currency devaluations, since the metal will hold its value regardless of the valuation of the currency which you are denominating it in Euro, in your case. Since the ECB has been hesitant to \"print\" large amounts of currency which causes other problems unrelated to precious metals, the necessity of hedging against a plummeting currency exchange rate is less important and should accordingly take a lower percentage in your diversification strategy. However, if you were in.. say... Argentina, for example, you would want to have a much larger percentage of your assets in precious metals. The EU has a lot of issues, and depreciation of hard assets courtesy of a lack of fluid currencycapital and overspending on a lot of EU governments parts in the past, in my opinion, lessens the preservative value of holding precious metals. You want to diversify more heavily into precious metals just prior to government sovereign currency devaluations, whether by \"printing\" by the ECB in your case or by hot capital flows intoout of your country. Since Eurozone is not an emerging market, and the current trend seems to be capital flowing back into the developed economies, I think that diversifying away from silver at least in overall  of your portfolio is the order of the day. That said, do I have silvergold in my retirement portfolio? Absolutely. Is it a huge percentage of my portfolio? Not right now. However, if the U.S. government fails to resolve the next budget crisis and forces the Federal Reserve to \"print\" money to creatively fund their expenses, then I will be trading out of soft assets classes and into precious metals in order to preserve the \"real value\" of my portfolio in the face of a depreciating USD. As for what to diversify into? Like the folks above say ETFsNOT precious metal ETFs and read all of the fine print, since a number of ETFs cheat, Indexes, Dividendpaying stocks a favorite of mine, assuming they maintain the dividend, or bonds after they raise the interest rates. Once you have your diversification percentages decided, then you just adjust that based on macroeconomic trends, in order to avoid pitfalls.

If price is going below 20 SMA then in near future even the SMA will start directing toward south. In your case if price has fallen below all the short period average lines and long period average line then it is bearish in nature. Soon in few days you may find 20 SMA leading downwards followed by closest period and then long. Also SMA and EMA can best be observed in charting software in candlestick mode. Because these moving averages can also be adjusted and viewed based on Opening price, High prices, Low Price or closing price. In you case I guess the data is of closing price data. Overlapping of averages may be sign of reversals. So if you want to buy this stock you may have to wait till all the average lines crossover and when new trend begins with SMA of shortest avg period 20 leading above the long avg period 90 days in your case.

In your case the price of a share would lose 2.65 and you will be credited by 2.65 in cash such that your portfolio wont change in value due to the dividend. Also, you cant exploit the drop in price by shortselling, as you would be owing the dividend to the person lending you the stock for the short sale.

So  the answer to your question is that they cant really take much more than your name and CC , unless you give it to them. If you give a false zip code, you may have your purchase rejected. They certainly do keep track of the credit card number, and I would suppose that is the most valuable piece to them they can see you make purchases across time and know for a fact that its the same exact person since its the same card. Additionally, zip codes for AVS from payatthepump are supposedly not generally used for marketing see this article for example.

    "topic": "How can I calculate total return of stock with partial sale?",
    "content": "There are many ways to calculate the return, and every way will give you a different results in terms of a percentagevalue. One way to always get something meaningful  count the cash. You had 977  31 and in the end you have 1.370, which means you have earned 363 dollars. But what is your return in terms of percentage? One way to look at it, is by pretending that it is a fund in which you invest 1 dollar. What is the fund worth in the beginning and in the end? The tricky part in your example is, you injected new capital into the equation. Initially you invested 977 dollars which later, in the second period became worth 1.473. You then sold off 200 shares for 950 dollars. Remember your portfolio is still worth 1.473, split between 950 in cash and 523 in Shares. So far so good  still easy to calculate return 1.473  977 1  50.8 return. Now you buy share for 981 dollars, but you only had 950 in cash? We now need to consider 2 scenarios. Either you or someone else injected 31 dollars into the fund  or you actually had the 31 dollars in the fund to begin with. If you already had the cash in the fund to begin with, your initial investment is 1.008 and not 977 977 in shares and 31 in cash. In the end the value of the fund is 1.370, which means your return is 1.370  1.007  36. Consider if the 31 dollars was paid in to the fund by someone other than you. You will then need to recalculate how much you each own of the fund. Just before the injection, the fund was worth 950 in cash and 387 in stock 310  200  110 x 3.54  1.339 dollars  then 31 dollars are injected, bringing the value of the fund up to 1.370. The ownership of the fund is split with 1.339  1.370  97.8 of the value for the old capital and 2.2 for the new capital. If the value of the fund was to change from here, you could calculate the return for each investor individually by applying their share of the funds value respective to their investment. Because the value of the fund has not changed since the last period bullet 3, the return on the original investment is 977  1.339  1  37.2 and the return on the new capital is 31  31  0. If you and not someone else injected the 31 dollar into the fund, you will need to calculate the weight of each share of capital in each period and get the average return for each period to get to a total return. In this specific case you will still get 37.2 return  but it gets even more comlex for each time you inject new capital."

    "topic": "Whats an ExchangeTraded Fund ETF?",
    "content": "ETFs offer the flexibility of stocks while retaining many of the benefits of mutual funds. Since an ETF is an actual fund, it has the diversification of its potentially many underlying securities. You can find ETFs with stocks at various market caps and style categories. You can have bond or mixed ETFs. You can even get ETFs with equal or fundamental weighting. In short, all the variety benefits of mutual funds. ETFs are typically much less expensive than mutual funds both in terms of management fees expense ratio and taxable gains. Most of them are not actively managed instead they follow an index and therefore have a low turnover. A mutual fund may actively trade and, if not balanced with a loss, will generate capital gains that you pay taxes on. An ETF will produce gains only when shifting to keep inline with the index or you yourself sell. As a reminder while expense ratio always matters, capital gains and dividends dont matter if the ETF or mutual fund is in a taxadvantaged account. ETFs have no load fees. Instead, because you trade it like a stock, you will pay a commission. Commissions are straight, upfront and perfectly clear. Much easier to understand than the various ways funds might charge you. There are no account minimums to entry with ETFs, but you will need to buy complete shares. Only a few places allow partial shares. It is generally harder to dollarcost average into an ETF with regular automated investments. Also, like trading stocks, you can do those fancy things like selling short, buying on margin, options, etc. And you can pay attention to the price fluctuations throughout the day if you really want to. Things to make you pause if you buy noload mutual funds through the parent company, youll get them at no commission. Many brokerages have No Transaction Fee NTF agreements with companies so that you can buy many funds for free. Still look out for that expense ratio though which is probably paying for that NTF advantage. As sort of a middle ground index funds can have very low expense ratios, track the same index as an ETF, can be taxefficient or taxmanaged, free to purchase, easy to dollarcost average and easier to automateunderstand.

This is a rule of thumb given out by many lay people and lowlevel financial advisors, but not by true experts in finance. It is little more than an old wives tale and does not come from solid theory nor empirical work. Finance theory says the following the riskiness of your portfolio should inversely correspond to your risk aversion. Period. It says nothing about your age. Some people become more riskaverse as they get older, but not everyone. In fact, for many people it probably makes sense to increase the riskiness of their portfolio as they age because the uncertainty about both wealth social security, the value of your house, the value of your human capital and costs how many kids you will have, the rate of inflation, where you will live go down as you age so your overall level of risk falls over time without a corresponding mechanical increase in risk aversion. In fact, if you start from the assumption that peoples aversion is to not having enough money at retirement, you get the result that people should invest in relatively safe securities until the probability of not having enough to cover their minimum needs gets small, then they invest in highly risky securities with any money above this threshold. This latter result sounds reasonable in your case. At this point it appears unlikely that you will be unable to meet your minimum needsIm assuming here that you are able to appreciate the warnings about underfunded pensions in other answers and still feel comfortable. With any money above and beyond what you consider to be prudent preparation for retirement, you should hold a risky but still fully diversified portfolio. Dont reduce the risk of that portion of your portfolio as you age unless you find your personal risk aversion increasing."

It focuses on highquality companies that have prospects for longterm total returns as a result of their ability to grow earnings and their willingness to increase dividends over time Obviously in 1993 quite a few companies paid the dividends and hence VDIGX was able to give dividends. Over the period of years in some years its given more and in some years less. For example the Year 2000 it gave  1.26, 1999 it gave  1.71 and in 1998 it gave  1.87 The current economic conditions are such that companies are not making huge profts and the ones that are making prefer not to distribute dividends and hold on to cash as it would help survive the current economic conditions. So just to clarify this particular funds objective is to invest in companies that would give dividends which is then passed on to fund holders. This fund does not sell appreciated stocks to convert it into dividends."

If you are also changing your asset class mixture, then it depends on how large the change is. I would still do the whole change at once. But if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps.

For instance, you thought gold was going to go up, and so you bought a gold miner. Say there are only two  ABC and XYZ. You buy XYZ. Then the CEO reveals their gold mine is played out, and the stock goes splat. Youre wiped out. But gold does go up, and ABC does gangbusters, especially now theyve got no competition. If youd bought both XYZ and ABC, you would have diversified your company risk, and you would have been much better off. Say you invested 10K, 5K in each. XYZ goes to zero, and you lose that 5K. ABC goes up 120, and is now worth 11K. So despite XYZ bankrupting, youre up 10 on your overall position. Sector risk You can categorize stocks by what \"sector\" theyre in.

But there are many more, like utilities, biotech, transportation, banks, etc. Stocks in a sector will tend to move together, so you can be right about the company, but if the sector is out of favor, its going to have a hard time going up. Lets extend the above example. What if you were wrong about gold going up? Then XYZ would still be bankrupt, and ABC would be making less money so they went down as well say, 20. At that point, youve only got 4K left. But say that besides gold, you also thought that banks were cheap. So, you split your investment between the gold miners and a couple of banks  lets call them LMN and OP  for 2500 each in XYZ, ABC, LMN, and OP. Say you were wrong about gold, but right about banks LMN goes up 15, and OP goes up 40. At that point, your portfolio looks like this XYZ start 2500 100 end 0 ABC start 2500 120 end 5500 LMN start 2500 15 end 2875 OP start 2500 40 end 3500 For a portfolio total of 11,875, or a total gain of 18.75. See how that works? RegionCountryCurrency risk So, now what if everythings been going up in the USA, and everything seems so overpriced? Well, odds are, some area of the world is not overbought. Like Brazil or England. So, you can buy some Brazilian or English companies, and diversify away from the USA. That way, if the market tanks here, those foreign companies arent caught in it, and could still go up. This is the same idea as the sector risk, except its location based, instead of business type based. There is an additional twist to this  currencies. The Brits use the pound, and the Brazilians use the real. Most small investors dont think about this much, but the value of currencies, including our dollar, fluctuates. If the dollar has been strong, and the pound weak as it has been, lately, then what happens if that changes? Say you own a British bank, and the dollar weakens and the pound strengthens. Even if that bank doesnt move at all, you would still make a gain. Example You buy British bank BBB for 40 pounds a share, when each pound costs 1.20. Say after a while, BBB is still 40 poundsshare, but the dollar weakened and the pound strengthened, such that each pound is now worth 1.50. You could sell BBB, and because of the currency exchange once youve got it converted back to dollars youd have a 25 gain. Market cap risk Sometimes big companies do well, sometimes its small companies. The small caps are riskier but higher returning. When you think about it, small and mid cap stocks have much more \"room to run\" than large caps do. Its much easier to double a company worth 1 billion than it is to double a company worth 100 billion. Investment types Stocks arent the only thing you can invest in. Theres also bonds, convertible bonds, CDs, preferred stocks, options and futures. It can get pretty complicated, especially the last two. But each of these investment behaves differently and again the idea is to have something going up all the time. The classical mix is stocks and bonds. The idea here is that when times are good, the stocks go up when times are bad, the bonds go up because theyre safer, so more people want them, but mostly theyre there to providing steady income and help keep your portfolio from cratering along with the stocks. Currently, this may not work out so well stocks and bonds have been moving in sync for several years, and with interest rates so low they dont provide much income. So what does this mean to you? Im going make some assumptions here based on your post. You said single index, selfmanaged, and dont lower overall risk and return. Im going to assume youre a small investor, young, you invest in ETFs, and the single index is the SP 500 index ETF  SPY. SP 500 is, roughly, the 500 biggest companies in the USA. Further, its weighted  how much of each stock is in the index  such that the bigger the company is, the bigger a percentage of the index it is. If slickcharts is right, the top 5 companies combined are already 11 of the index! Apple, Microsoft, Exxon, Amazon, and Johnson  Johnson. The smallest, News Corp, is a measly 0.008 of the index. In other words, if all youre invested in is SPY, youre invested in a handfull of giant american companies, and a little bit of other stuff besides. To diversify Company risk and sector risk arent really relevant to you, since you want broad market ETFs theyve already got that covered. The first thing I would do is add some smaller companies  get some ETFs for mid cap, and small cap value not small cap growth it sucks for structural reasons. Examples are IWR for midcap and VBR for smallcap value. After youve done that, and are comfortable with what you have, it may be time to branch out internationally. You can get ETFs for regions such as the EU  check out IEV, or countries like Japan  see EWJ. But youd probably want to start with one thats \"all major countries that arent the USA\"  check out EFA. In any case, dont go too crazy with it. As index investing goes, the SP 500 is not a bad way to go. Feed in anything else a little bit at a time, and take the time to really understand what it is youre investing in. So for example, using the ETFs I mentioned, add in 10 each IWR and VBR. Then after youre comfortable, maybe add 10 EFA, and raise IWR to 20. What the ultimate percentages are, of course, is something you have to decide for yourself. Or, you could just chuck it all and buy a single Target Date Retirement fund from, say, Vanguard or T. Rowe Price and just not worry about it."

    "content": "A company whose stock is available for sale to the public is called a publiclyheld or publiclytraded company. A public companys stock is sold on a stock exchange, and anyone with money can buy shares through a stock broker. This contrasts with a privatelyheld company, in which the shares are not traded on a stock exchange. In order to invest in a private company, you would need to talk directly to the current owners of the company. Finding out if a company is public or private is fairly easy. One way to check this is to look at the Wikipedia page for the company. For example, if you take a look at the Apple page, on the right sidebar youll see \"Type Public\", followed by the stock exchange ticker symbol \"AAPL\". Compare this to the page for Mars, Inc. on that page, youll see \"Type Private\", and no stock ticker symbol listed. Another way to tell If you can find a quote for a share price on a financial site such as Google Finance or Yahoo Finance, you can buy the stock. You wont find a stock price for Mars, Inc. anywhere, because the stock is not publicly traded."

    "content": "The actual price is represented on charts and not the change in price as a percentage, because it is the actual price which is used in all other parts of analysis both technical and fundamental, and it is the actual figure the security is bought and sold at. A change in price has to be relative to a previous price at a previous time, and we can easily work out the change in price over any given time period. I think what you are concerned about is how to compare a certain actual price change in low priced securities to the same actual price change in a higher priced securities. For example 1.00 rise in a 2.00 stock representing a 50 increase in price 1.00 rise in a 10.00 stock representing a 10 increase in price. On a standard chart both of these look the same, as they both show a 1.00 increase in price. So what can we do to show the true representation of the percentage increase in price? It is actually quite simple. You view the chart using a log scale instead of a standard scale most charting packages should have this option. What may look like a bubble on a standard scale chart, looks like a healthy uptrend on a log scale chart and represents a true picture of the percentage change in price. Example of Standard Price Scale VS LOG Price Scale on a Chart Standard Price Scale On the standard scale the price seems to have very little movement from Mar09 to Jan12 and then the price seems to zoom up after Jan12 to Mar13. This is because a 4 increase for example of 0.50 is only 0.02, whilst a 4 increase of 7.00 0.28, so the increases seem much bigger at the end of the chart. LOG Price Scale On the LOG chart however, these price changes seem to be more evenly displayed no matter at what price level the price change has occurred at. This thus give a better representation of how fast or slow the price is rising or falling, or the size of the change in price."

    "content": "All else being equal, you should look for more volatile riskier stocks. Technically, it was all time value  the entire value of an \"out of the money\" option is time value. Whats confusing is that time value is affected by numerous variables, only one of which is time. The reason volatility is the one to look at is that all the rest are likely already intuitive to you, or are too minor an influence to worry about Current riskfree interest rates and a stocks dividend payout during the life of the option affect the value of the call, but are usually minor infulences. Higher interest rates makes call values higher, and higher dividend yield makes call values lower. Longer time to expiration will increase the value of the call, but youre pretty likely already focused on that. The strike prices proximity to the current price affects the calls value  agreeing to sell a stock 5 above current levels will pay more than agreeing to sell it 10 above current levels  but again, this is likely obvious to you. Volatility, or the percent by which the stock is likely to move up or down on a given day, is almost certainly the variable thats not already obvious. Stocks that jump all over the place have higher volatility than those that move more predictably. The reason that options calls and puts cost more on higher volatility names is that options payout is asymmetrical. In the case of calls, the option holder gets all the upside, but none of the downside, other than what they paid for the opotion. If one stock goes up or down 5 every day, and another goes up or down 20 every day and you could pay some fixed amount to get that stocks upside, but not have any exposure to its downside, other than that fixed amount, youd pay more for the one that pays you 20 or 0 than you would for the one that pays you 5 or 0. Thats why higher volatility meaning larger daily moves makes optimum prices higher."

Also when you take cash out of CVLI the insurance value drops by a like amount. So you cant have your cake and leave it to your heirs too. Either you get the cash value OR they get the insurance value. Hopefully, there could be some of both. Although I believe the philosophy of that answer I have two issues with it. First, you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month. I can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance? Second, for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value. My life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period. Hmm, maybe there isnt a one size fits all solution. If you need a large amount of insurance, term life will certainly be more affordable. However, considering this as an investment I would not expect that to be a deciding factor. Good luck with your decision. It is great that at such a young age you are concerned about investments."

However from a personal finance perspective this kind of drama is somewhat common when someone is deceased and financial expectations are not met by the heirs. It sounds like the daughter was expecting a lot more in inheritance than was actually received. There was probably an overestimation of dads net worth and an underestimation of the cost of his care toward the end of his life. Its best not to participate in this drama, and I feel that you are correct that the daughter does not have a right to see the bank account statements prior to dads passage. The question is also if she has a right to see it now. Here in the US a joint account can be setup so the ownership transfers to other account holders up death of an owner. So in this case your mother would own the account. If the account is setup as such, then the estate has no right to that money. You may want to check with the bank for some free advice. What is the classification of the account now that dad has passed? When a person grants someone else the power of attorney they have the ability to act as if they were that person. Most of the time POAs are limited in scope so If I give a person the POA to register a car in my name, they cannot apply for a credit card in my name legally. In this case, however, the POA was probably general so pretty much your mom could do whatever she pleased. So if your mom took good care of the dad and bought herself some nice jewelry that is perfectly allowable with a general POA. I strongly doubt this daughter has any rights to the past records and may not even have the rights to the joint bank account currently."

However, note that I am not answering your question of what you should invest in now to take advantage of such an event. That is a pretty ridiculous notion. Preparing oneself for such a possibility is certainly a good idea. That said, there are some realistic limitations to how you could take advantage of such a situation. Namely, the very real requirement of physical security. Unless you have a huge posse  armed to the teeth  to defend your cache, someone will come along with a bigger and better armed group to take it. Not to mention that I am the type of person that would  at least  consider organizing such a group to take you down if only as a matter of principle. Guns  ammo Also, knives ideally ones that can be used as weapons and for food preparationhunting. Alcohol. Especially liquor. Its concentrated and easier to store than beer or wine. Beside for getting inebriated, it is useful as a sedative and antiseptic. Nonperishable foods. Canned goods are obvious. Though, grains and cereals can be stored with relative ease under some circumstances. Obviously, not so easily done in an urban area. Methods of starting a fire. Preferably rugged ones, such as flint and steel. Lighters would only be of limited use. Matches are bulky and require watertight storage. Salt andor saltlicks. Possibly, other forms of nonperishable bait. As bstpierre puts it, hunting will be about survival not sport. Handtools. Textiles, fabrics, thread and needles. Medicines of all sorts, though especially antibiotics, antiseptics and painkillers. Books of a practical nature. Topics such as wilderness survival, cooking, carpentry, etc. The list is mostly ordered in terms of value  practicality. Ultimately, I doubt there is much that will provide a practical investment idea for such a scenario. The physical security issue is a big limiting factor. In a postapocalyptic scenario it goes back to who is bigger, stronger and better armed. One thing does come to mind knowledge. Prepare yourself with the skills and knowledge you need to survive in such a scenario and you will be invaluable. Also, as bstpierre notes in the comments, connections will likely also be important. Probably local or nearby connections. No one person can do it all alone. It will come down to cooperation."

That is their principal difference from an investment point of view. According to Wikipedias article on platinum, ... during periods of economic uncertainty, the price of platinum tends to decrease due to reduced industrial demand, falling below the price of gold. Gold prices are more stable in slow economic times, as gold is considered a safe haven and gold demand is not driven by industrial uses. If your investment scenario is a tanking world economy, for reason of its large industrial usage, I for one would not count on platinum to not fall in price. Of course gold may fall in price as well, but since it is not primarily an industrial use commodity, I would personally expect gold to do better in such a scenario."

Market capitalizations are frequently generally approximately equal to the sales of a company. Salaries and wages are frequently generally two thirds of sales. It is indeed expensive for the average company to compensate with equity, thus so few do, usually restricting equity compensation to executives and exceptional laborers. Besides, they frequently have enough cash to pay for compensation, avoiding transaction costs. For companies in growth industries such as technology or medicine, their situations are usually reversed cash constrained yet equity abundant because of large investment and dearly priced equities.

Your objective is to choose the fastest boat at any time. If you invest all of your money in one small boat, that might sink before the end of the year, you are putting yourself at risk. Say Startup Capital. If you invest all of your money in a medium sized boat, you still run the risk of it sinking. Say Stock market stock. If you invest all of your money in a supertanker, the risk of it sinking is smaller, and the probability of it ending first in the race is also smaller. Say a stock of a multinational. A fleet is limited by its slowest boat, but it will surely reach the shore. Say a fund. Now investing money is time consuming, and you may not have the money to create your own portfolio your own fleet. So a fund should be your choice.

Youve done the math and with 40 hour weeks they can easily afford the loan. Furthermore, you know this person well and you know that after a few weeks of not enough shifts, theyve got the gumption to go out and find a second job or a different job that will give them 40 hours or more a week. And you know that they have some savings they could use to ensure that no payments will be missed even on lowwage weeks. You can cosign for this person, say for a car loan to get them a car they can drive to that job, knowing that they arent going to walk away and just stop making the payments. The loan issuer doesnt know any of that. Or consider a young person with poor credit but good income who has recently decided to get smart about money, has written out a budget and a plan to rehabilitate their credit, and who you know will work passionately to make every payment and get the credit score up to a place where they can buy a house or whatever their goal is. Again, you can cosign for this person to make that happen, because you know something the lender doesnt. Or consider a middle aged person whos had some very hard knocks laid off in a plant closing perhaps, marriage failure, lost all their house equity when the market collapsed, that sort of thing. They have a chance to start over again somewhere else and you have a chance to help. Again you know this isnt someone who is going to mismanage their money and walk away from the payments and leave you holding the bag. If you would give the person the money anyway say, a car for your newly graduated child then cosigning instead gives them more of a sense of accomplishment, since they paid for it, and gives them a great credit rating too. If you would not give the person the entire loan amount, but would make their payments for many months or even a year say, your brothers mortgage for the house where he lives with a sick wife and 3 small children, then cosigning is only making official what you would have done anyway. Arrange with the borrower that if they cant make their payments any more, you will backstop them AND the item car, house, whatever is going up for sale to cover your losses. If you dont think you could enforce that just from the strength of the relationship, reconsider cosigning. Then sign what you need to sign and step away from it. Its their loan, not yours. You want them to pay it and to manage it and to leave you out of it until its all paid off and they thank you for your help. If things go south, you will have to pay, and it may take a while for you to sell the item or otherwise stop the paying, so you do need to be very confident that the borrower is going to make every single payment on time. My point is just that you can have that confidence, based on personal knowledge of character, employment situation, savings and other resources, in a way that a lender really cannot."

For example, persons claiming treaty benefits on royalties must complete this line if the treaty contains different withholding rates for different types of royalties. In tax treaties, some of the benefits apply to every resident of a foreign country. Other benefits only apply to certain groups of people. Line 10 is where you affirm that you meet whatever special conditions are necessary in the treaty to obtain the benefit. If you are claiming that Article 15 of the U.S.India Tax Treaty, you could use Line 10 to do this.

They arent offering you a 2500 cash incentive, but adding a 2500 surcharge if you take their financing package  which means youre actually paying significantly more than 0.9 for that loan! Remember that you can borrow from folks other than the dealer. If you do that, you still get the cash price, since the dealer is getting cash.

Secondly because Toyota corporate simply isnt set up to sell a car directly to a customer. I know there are services that help people through the buying process. If youre finding Toyota dealerships to be this difficult you may consider just buying something from someone who wants to sell to you. If the buying process is this difficult imagine the service relationship. Edit Additionally, its important to remember when financing a car that there are essentially two transactions taking place. First youre negotiating the price of the car. Then you negotiate the price of the money the interest rate. The money does not need to come from the dealership, you can secure your financing rate from a separate bank or local credit union. You should definitely pursue alternate financing if theyre quoting you 7.99 with a FICO of 710. But dont tell the dealership youve already got your financing lined up until youre happy with the price of the car."

    "topic": "Is gold really an investment or just a hedge against inflation?",
    "content": "Another answer to this question occurred to me as I started learning more about historical uses for gold etc. Perhaps its a crackpot idea, but Im going to float it anyway to see what you folks think. Investing in Gold is an indirect investment in the Economy and GDP of the nation of India. To that extent is it only a hedge against inflation, so long as the indian economy grows at a more rapid rate than your local inflation rate. Fact, India currently consumes more than 13 of gold production, predominantly in the form of Jewelry. And their demand has been growing rapidly, up 69 just between 2009 and 2010 alone. I cant find too many historial consumption numbers for India, but when you look at past articles on this subject, you see phrases like one forth and 20 being used only a few years go to describe Indias consumption levels. Fact, India has virtually no domestic sources of gold. Indias handful of gold mines produce about 2.5 tonnes of the metal each year, a fraction of the countrys annual consumption of about 800 tonnes. Fact. Indian Culture places high value on gold as a visible demonstration of wealth. Particularly in situations such In Indian weddings where the bride brings in gold to show her familys status and wealth and it forms part of the dowry given to bride. It is believed that a bride wearing 24k gold on their wedding to bring luck and happiness throughout the married life. Fact, the recent trends in outsourcing, Indian citizens working abroad sending money home, etc have all lead to a influx of foreign cash to the Indian economy and explosive GDP growth. See the following chart and compare the period of 2000current with a chart showing the price of gold in other answer here. Notice how the curves parallel each other to a large degree Potentially unfounded conclusion drawn from above numbers. The rapid growth of the Indian economy, coupled with a rich cultural tradition that values gold as a symbol of wealth, along with a sudden rise in wealthy people due to the economy and influx of foreign cash, has resulted in skyrocketing demand for gold from India, and this large consumption demand is the most likely explanation for the sudden rise in the price of gold over the last several years. Investors then jump on the rising price bandwagon as especially does anyone that can make a profit from selling gold to those seeking to get on said bandwagon. As such, as long as indian cultural tradition remains unchanged, and their economy remains strong, the resulting increasing demand for gold will sustain current and perhaps increased prices. Should there be any sudden collapse in the Indian GDP, gold will likely tumble in parallel. disclaimer not an expert, just observations based off the data Ive seen, there may be other parts to the picture of gold demand that Ive not considered."

    "topic": "Difference between IRR and ROR",
    "content": "There may be differences in different contexts, but heres my general understanding Rate of Return or Return on Investment is the total gain or loss of an investment divided by the initial investment amount. e.g. if you buy stock for 100 and later sell it for 120 you have a 20 Rate of Return. You would have a 20 ROR regardless of if you sell it tomorrow or in a year. Internal Rate of Return is effectively annualized. It is the annual rate at which each of a series of cashflows is discounted that would give you a net present value of 0. Meaning if you spent 100 today and in exactly one year you received 120 back, you would have an IRR of 20. If you received the 120 back in 6 months, your IRR would be roughly 40. An IRR calculation can include multiple cashflows at various times, while ROR is in my mind the total net gain or loss relative to the investment irrespective of the time of the cash flows. IRR is more effective when comparing investments that have different time horizons. Spending 100 to get 120 tomorrow is much better from an IRR perspective than getting 120 two years from now, since you could take that 20 gain and invest it for the rest of the two years."

    "topic": "How does the spread on an orderbook affect shorting?",
    "content": "A bid is an offer to buy something on an order book, so for example you may post an offer to buy one share, at 5. An ask is an offer to sell something on an order book, at a set price. For example you may post an offer to sell shares at 6. A trade happens when there are bidsasks that overlap each other, or are at the same price, so there is always a spread of at least one of the smallest currency unit the exchange allows. Betting that the price of an asset will go down, traditionally by borrowing some of that asset and then selling it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference minus interest. So, lets say as per your example you borrow 100 shares of company X, expecting the price of them to go down. You take your shares to the market and sell them  you make a market sell order a market ask. This matches against a bid and you receive a price of 5 per share. Now, lets pretend that you change your mind and you think the price is going to go up, you instantly regret your decision. In order to pay back the shares, you now need to buy back your shares as 6  which is the price off the ask offers on the order book. Because of this spread, you have lost money. You sold at a low price and bought at a high price, meaning it costs you more money to repay your borrowed shares. So, when you are shorting you need the spread to be as tight as possible."

Take a look at the full list of holdings. While EFA is the only underlying security e.g. ETF, Stock, Bond, et.c, the remaining holdings looks to be 133 remaining holdings are cash positions. Some of those positions are negative for hedge purposes. Because of this, the total value of the portfolio is less than the position of EFA itself since total value is EFA plus a bunch of negative entries because the total value is less than EFA itself, EFA has a  100 weighting."

Securities become almost perfectly correlated during a crash therefore, market crash risk of one security is essentially equal to the market crash risk, so hedging the security itself makes a position market neutral for crash risk.

If you are a member of a partnership that at any time during the tax year is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, you are considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States. You usually are engaged in a U.S. trade or business when you perform personal services in the United States. If you own and operate a business in the United States selling services, products, or merchandise, you are, with certain exceptions, engaged in a trade or business in the United States. For example, profit from the sale in the United States of inventory property purchased either in this country or in a foreign country is effectively connected trade or business income. Gains and losses from the sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests whether or not they are capital assets are taxed as if you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States.

    "topic": "In the US, does getting a loan with a cosigner, help your credit rating?",
    "content": "It all comes down to how the loan itself is structured and reported  the exact details of how they run the loan paperwork, and howif they report the activity on the loan to one of the credit bureaus and which one they report to. It can go generally one of three ways A The loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. In this scenario, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially this will generally drop related credit scores somewhat its a \"hard pull\", new account with zero history, and increased debt, but over time this can have a positive effect on both peoples credit rating. This is the typical scenario one might logically expect to be the norm, and it effects both parties credit just as if they were a sole signor for the loan. And as always, if the loan is not paid properly it will negatively effect both peoples credit, and the owner of the loan can choose to come after either or both parties in whatever order they want. B The loan company just runs the loan with one person, and only reports to a credit agency on one of you probably the cosignor, leaving the other as just a backup. If you arent paying close attention they may even arrange it where the initial party wanting to take the loan isnt even on most of the paperwork. This let the person trying to run the loan get something accepted that might not have been otherwise, or save some time, or was just an error. In this case it will have no effect on Person As credit. Weve had a number of question like this, and this isnt really a rare occurrence. Never assume people selling you things are necessarily accurate or honest  always verify. C The loan company just doesnt report the loan at all to a credit agency, or does so incorrectly. They are under no obligation to report to credit agencies, its strictly up to them. If you dont pay then they can report it as something \"in collections\". This isnt the typical way of doing business for most places, but some businesses still operate this way, including some places that advertise how doing business with them paying them grossly inflated interest rates will \"help build your credit\". Most advertising fraud goes unpunished. Note Under all of the above scenarios, the loan can only effect the credit rating attached to the bureau it is reported to. If the loan is reported to Equifax, it will not help you with a TransUnion or Experian rating at all. Some loans report to multiple credit bureaus, but many dont bother, and credit bureaus dont automatically copy each other. Its important to remember that there isnt so much a thing as a singular \"consumer credit rating\", as there are \"consumer credit ratings\"  3 of them, for most purposes, and they can vary widely depending on your reported histories. Also, if it is only a shortterm loan of 36 months then it is unlikely to have a powerful impact on anyones credit rating. Credit scores are formulas calibrated to care about longterm behavior, where 3 years of perfect credit history is still considered a short period of time and you will be deemed to have a significant risk of default without more data. So dont expect to qualify for a primerate mortgage because of a car loan that was paid off in a few months it might be enough to give you a score if you dont have one, but dont expect much more. As always, please remember that taking out a loan just to improve credit is almost always a terrible idea. Unless you have a very specific reason with a carefully researched and wellvetted plan that means that its very important you build credit in this specific way, you should generally focus on establishing credit in ways that dont actually cost you any money at all. Look for no fee credit cards that you pay in full each month, even if you have to start with creditbuilding secured card plans, and switch to cashvalue nofee rewards cards for a 13 if you operate your financial life in a way that this doesnt end up manipulating your purchasing decisions to cost you money.

Although New York City isnt a state, the size and scope of its finances is greater than many US states.

I have seen some companies that are paying close to 10 dividends but are losing money and have to borrow funds just to maintain the dividends. How long can these companies continue paying dividends at this rate or at all. Would you keep investing in a stock paying 10 dividends per year where the share price is falling 20 per year? I know I wouldnt. Some high dividend paying stocks also tend to grow a lot slower than lower or non dividend paying stocks. You should look at the total return  both dividend yield and capital return combined to make a better decision. You should also never stay in a stock which is falling drastically just because it pays a dividend. I would never stay in a stock that falls 20, 30, 50 or more just because I am getting a 5 dividend. Regarding taxation, some countries may have special taxation rules when it comes to dividends just like they may have special taxation rules for longer term capital gains compared to shorter term capital gains. Again no one should use taxation as the main purpose to make an investment decision. You should factor taxation into your decision but it should never be the determining factor of your decisions.

    "topic": "Am I considered in debt if I pay a mortgage?",
    "content": "The statistic you cited comes from the Federal Reserve Boards Survey of Consumer Finances, a survey that they do every three years, most recently in 2013. This was reported in the September 2014 issue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin. They list the percentage of Americans with any type of debt as 74.5 in 2013, down slightly from 74.9 in 2010. The Bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have, and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list. So the answer is yes, the 75 statistic includes Americans with home mortgages. The bigger question is, are you really \"in debt\" if you have a home mortgage? The answer to that is also yes. When you take out a mortgage, you really do own the house. You decide who lives there, you decide what changes you are going to make to it, and you are responsible for the upkeep. But the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house. This means that if you refuse to pay, the bank is allowed to take possession of the house. They dont even get the \"whole\" house, though they will sell it to recoup their losses, and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied. Is it good debt? Many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset, the debt is acceptable. With this definition, a car loan is bad, credit card debt is very bad, and a home mortgage might be okay. Even Dave Ramsey, radio host and champion of the debtfree lifestyle, is not opposed to home mortgages. Home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford.  Interestingly, according to the bulletin appendix, credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid, not including purchases made after the bill. So people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered \"in debt\" in this statistic."

Emphasized it on purpose, because many people especially those who gamble on stock exchange without knowing what theyre doing dont understand how the stock market works. On the stock exchange, the transaction price is the match between the bid price and the ask price. Thus, on any given transaction, bid always equals ask. Theres no spread. There is spread with commodities if you buy it directly, especially, contracts, mutual funds and other kinds of brokered transactions that go through a third party. The difference spread is that third partys fee for assuming part of the risk in the transaction, and is indeed added to your cost indirectly, in the way you described. These transactions dont go directly between a seller and a buyer. For example, theres no buyer when you redeem some of your mutual fund  the fund pays you money. So the fund assumes certain risk, which is why theres a spread in the prices to invest and to redeem. Similarly with commodities when you buy a gold bar  you buy it from a dealer, who needs to keep a stock. Thus, the dealer will not buy from you at the same price theres a premium on sale and a discount on buy, which is a spread, to compensate the dealer for the risk of keeping a stock."

In fact you should have had it before you started, but that ship has sailed. Youre talking about startup expenses. You can generally deduct up to 5000 in the year your business starts, and the expenses in excess will be amortized over 180 months 15 years. This is per the IRC Sec. 195. The amortization starts when your business is active i.e. you can buy the property, but not actually open the restaurant  you cannot start the depreciation. I have a couple questions about accounting  should all the money I spent be a part of capital spending? Or is it just a part of it? If it qualifies as startuporganizational expenses  it should be capitalized. If it is spent on capital assets  then it should also be capitalized, but for different reasons and differently. For example, costs of filing paperwork for permits is a startup expense. Buying a commercial oven is a capital asset purchase which should be depreciated separately, as buying the tables and silverware. If it is a salary expense to your employees  then it is a current expense and shouldnt be capitalized. Our company is LLC if this matters. It matters to how it affects your personal tax return."

    "topic": "Why gamma scalping is not advised for retail traders with reg T margin",
    "content": "My interpretation of that sentence is that you cant do the buyingselling of shares outright sans margin because of the massive quantity of shares hes talking about. So you have to use margin to buy the stocks. However, because in order to make significant money with this sort of strategy you probably need to be working dozens of stocks at the same time, you need to be familiar with portfolio margin. Since your broker does not calculate margin calls based on individual stocks, but rather on the value of your whole portfolio, you should have experience handling margin not just on individual stock movements but also on overall portfolio movements. For example, if 10 by value of the stocks youre targeting tend to have a correlation of 0.8 with the price of oil you should probably target another 10 by value in stocks that tend to have a correlation of 0.8 with the price of oil. And so on and so forth. That way your portfolio can weather big or even small changes in market conditions that would cause a margin call on a novice investors portfolio."

    "topic": "Should I use put extra money toward paying off my student loans or investing in an index fund?",
    "content": "First, Id like to congratulate you on your financial discipline in paying off your loans and living well within your means. I have friends who make more than twice your salary with similar debt obligations, and they barely scrape by month to month. If we combine your student loan debt and unallocated income each month, we get about 1,350. You say that 378 per month is the minimum payment for your loans, which have an average interest rate of about 3.5. Thus, you have about 1,350 a month to \"invest.\" Making your loan payments is basically the same as investing with the same return as the loan interest rate, when it comes down to it. An interest rate of 3.5 is...not great, all things considered, and barely above inflation. However, thats a guaranteed return of 3.5, more or less like a bond. As noted previously, the stock market historically averages 10 before inflation over the long run. The US stock market is right around its historic high at this point DJIA is at 20,700 today, April 6th, 2017  historic high hit just over 21,000 on March 1, 2017. Obviously, no one can predict the future, but I get the feeling that a market correction may be in order, especially depending on how things go in Washington in the next weeks or months. If thats the case again, we have no way of knowing if it is, youd be foolish to invest heavily in any stocks at this point. What I would do, given your situation, is invest the 1,350month in a \"portfolio\" thats 5050 stocks and \"bonds,\" where the bonds here are your student loans. Here, you have a guaranteed return of 3.5 on the bond portion, and you can still hedge the other 50 on stocks continuing their run and also benefiting from dividends, capital gains, etc. over time. I would apply the extra loan payments to the highestinterest loan first, paying only the minimum to the others. Once the highestinterest loan is paid off, move onto the next one. Once you have all your loans paid off, your portfolio will be pretty much 100 stocks, at which point you may want to add in some actual bonds say a 9010 or 8020 split, depending on what you want. Im assuming youre pretty young, so you still have plenty of time to let the magic of compounding interest do its work, even if you happen to get into the market right before it drops well, that, and the fact that you wont really have much invested anyway. Again, let me stress that neither I nor anyone else has any way of knowing what will happen with the market  Im just stating my opinion and what my course of action would be if I were in your shoes."

    "topic": "Why do companies have a fiscal year different from the calendar year?",
    "content": "I can think of a few good reasons A company, especially public, usually wants their fourthquarter earnings to be the strongest of the year. That ends each fiscal year on a high note for the company and its investors, which helps public sentiment and boosts stock prices. So, travel agencies and airlines usually like ending their year in October or March, in the lull between the summer and winter travel seasons with a large amount of that revenue falling within the companys fiscal Q4. Oil companies sometimes do the same because fuel prices are seasonal for much the same reasons. December is a really bad month to try to close out an entire years accounting books. Accountants and execs are on vacation for large parts of the month, most retail stores are flooded with revenue and then contrarevenue as items are returned that takes time to account at the store level and then filter up to the corporate office, etc etc. It also doesnt tell the whole story for most retail outfits December sales are usually inflated by purchases that are then returned in January after all the hullaballoo. As a result, a fiscal year end in January or even February keeps the entire seasons revenues and expenses in one fiscal year."

Suppose you have 10000 to invest. Use limits like minimum 200 investment when index is high, maximum 600 investment when index is down and when index gives normal returns, invest 400.

    "topic": "Why could rental costs for apartmentshouses rise while buying prices can go up and down?",
    "content": "I am from Australia, so my answer is based on my experience over here, however it should be similar for the USA. Generally, what determines both the price of housesapartments and the rents for them is supply and demand. When there is high demand and low supply prices or rents generally go up. When there is low demand and high supply prices or rents usually go down. What can sometimes happen when house prices go down, is that the demand can drop but so can supply. As the prices drop, developers will make less money on building new houses, so stop building new houses. Other developers can go bankrupt. As less people including investors are buying houses, and more people including investors try to sell their existing houses, there will be more people looking to rent and less rental properties available to rent. This produces a perfect storm of high demand and low supply of rental properties, causing rents to rise strongly. When the property prices start to go up again as demand increases, there is a shortfall of new properties being built due to the developers not building during the downturn. At this time developers start to build again but there is a lag time before the new houses can be completed. This lack of supply puts more pressure on both house prices and rents to go up further. Until equilibrium between supply and demand is realised or an oversupply of rental properties exists in the market, rents will continue to rise."

    "topic": "One Share Stock Reverse Split",
    "content": "Any time there is a share adjustment from spinoff, merger, stock split, or reverse slit there is zero chance for the stockholders to hang on to fractional shares. They are turned into cash. For the employees in the 401K program or investors via a mutual fund or ETF this isnt a problem. Because the fraction of a share left over is compared to the thousands or millions of shares owned by the fund as a collective. For the individual investor in the company this can be a problem that they arent happy about. In some cases the fractional share is a byproduct that will result from any of these events. In the case of a corporate merger or spinoff most investors will not have an integer number of shares, so that fraction leftover that gets converted to cash isnt a big deal. When they want to boost the price to a specific range to meet a regulatory requirement, they are getting desperate and dont care that some will be forced out. In other cases it is by design to force many shareholders out. They want to go private. They to 1for1000 split. If you had less than 1000 shares presplit then you will end up with zero shares plus cash. They know exactly what number to use. The result after the split is that the number of investors is small enough they they can now fall under a different set of regulations. They have gone dark, they dont have to file as many reports, and they can keep control of the company.

    "topic": "What options do I have at 26 years old, with 1.2 million USD?",
    "content": "Pay off the credit cards. From now on, pay off the credit cards monthly. Under no circumstances should you borrow money. You have net worth but no external income. Borrowing is useless to you. 200,000 in two bank accounts, because if one bank collapses, you want to have a spare while you wait for the government to pay off the guarantee. Keep 50,000 in checking and another 50k in savings. The remainder put into CDs. Dont expect interest income beyond inflation. Real interest rates after inflation are often slightly negative. People ask why you might keep money in the bank rather than stocksbonds. The problem is that stocksbonds dont always maintain their value, much less go up. The bank money wont gain, but it wont suddenly lose half its value either. It can easily take five years after a stock market crash for the market to recover. You dont want to be withdrawing from losses. Some people have suggested more bonds and fewer stocks. But putting some of the money in the bank is better than bonds. Bonds sometimes lose money, like stocks. Instead, park some of the money in the bank and pick a more aggressive stockbond mixture. That way youre never desperate for money, and you can survive market dips. And the stockbond part of the investment will return more at 7030 than 6040. 700,000 in stock mutual funds. 300,000 in bond mutual funds. Look for broad indexes rather than high returns. You need this to grow by the inflation rate just to keep even. Thats 20,000 to 30,000 a year. Keep the balance between 7030 and 7525. You can move half the excess beyond inflation to your bank accounts. Thats the money you have to spend each year. Dont withdraw money if you arent keeping up with inflation. Dont try to time the market. Much better informed people with better resources will be trying to do that and failing. Play the odds instead. Keep to a consistent strategy and let the market come back to you. If you chase it, you are likely to lose money. If you dont spend money this year, you can save it for next year. Anything beyond 200,000 in the bank accounts is available for spending. In an emergency you may have to draw down the 200,000. Be careful. Its not as big a cushion as it seems, because you dont have an external income to replace it. I live in southern California but would like to move overseas after establishing stable investments. I am not the type of person that would invest in McDonalds, but would consider other less evil franchises maybe?. These are contradictory goals, as stated. A franchise meaning a local business of a national brand is not a \"stable investment\". A franchise is something that you actively manage. At minimum, you have to hire someone to run the franchise. And as a general rule, they arent as turnkey as they promise. How do you pick a good manager? How will you tell if they know how the business works? Particularly if you dont know. How will you tell that they are honest and wont just embezzle your money? Or more honestly, give you too much of the business revenues such that the business is not sustainable? Or spend so much on the business that you cant recover it as revenue? Some have suggested that you meant brand or stock rather than franchise. If so, you can ignore the last few paragraphs. I would be careful about making moral judgments about companies. McDonalds pays its workers too little. Google invades privacy. Exxon is bad for the environment. Chase collects fees from people desperate for money. Tesla relies on government subsidies. Every successful company has some way in which it can be considered \"evil\". And unsuccessful companies are evil in that they go out of business, leaving workers, customers, and investors i.e. you! in the lurch. Regardless, you should invest in broad index funds rather than individual stocks. If college is out of the question, then so should be stock investing. Its at least as much work and needs to be maintained. In terms of living overseas, dip your toe in first. Rent a small place for a few months. Find out how much it costs to live there. Remember to leave money for bigger expenses. You should be able to live on 20,000 or 25,000 a year now. Then you can plan on spending 35,000 a year to do it for real including odd expenses that dont happen every month. Make sure that you have health insurance arranged. Eventually you may buy a place. If you can find one that you can afford for something like 100,000. Note that 100,000 would be low in California but sufficient even in many places in the US. Think rural, like the South or Midwest. And of course that would be more money in many countries in South America, Africa, or southern Asia. Even southern and eastern Europe might be possible. You might even pay a bit more and rent part of the property. In the US, this would be a duplex or a bed and breakfast. They may use different terms elsewhere. Given your health, do you need a maidcook? That would lean towards something like a bed and breakfast, where the same person can clean for both you and the guests. Same with cooking, although that might be a second person or more. Hire a bookkeeperaccountant first, as youll want help evaluating potential purchases. Keep the business small enough that you can actively monitor it. Part of the problem here is that a million dollars sounds like a lot of money but isnt. You arent rich. This is about bare minimum for surviving with a middle class lifestyle in the United States and other first world countries. You cant live like a tourist. Its true that many places overseas are cheaper. But many arent including much of Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, etc.. And the ones that arent may surprise you. And you also may find that some of the things that you personally want or need to buy are expensive elsewhere. Dabble first and commit slowly be sure first. Include rarer things like travel in your expenses. Long term, there will be currency rate worries overseas. If you move permanently, you should certainly move your bank accounts there relatively soon perhaps keep part of one in the US for emergencies that may bring you back. And move your investments as well. Your return may actually improve, although some of that is likely to be eaten up by inflation. A 10 return in a country with 12 inflation is a negative real return. Try to balance your investments by where your money gets spent. If you are eating imported food, put some of the investment in the place from which you are importing. That way, if exchange rates push your food costs up, they will likely increase your investments at the same time. If you are buying stuff online from US vendors and having it shipped to you, keep some of your investments in the US for the same reason. Make currency fluctuations work with you rather than against you. I dont know what your circumstances are in terms of health. If you can work, you probably should. Given twenty years, your million could grow to enough to live off securely. As is, you would be in trouble with another stock market crash. Youd have to live off the bank account money while you waited for your stocks and bonds to recover."

This is a basic set of security rules and practices which should make hacking unlikely. Compliance is achievable not easy, and if you do it, youre off the hook. That is one way Amy can be entirely not at fault. Example deleted for length, but as a small business, you just cant be a PCI security expert. You rely on the commitments of others to do a good job, like your bank and merchant account salesman. There are so many ways this can go wrong that just arent your fault. As to the notion of saying \"it affected Amys customers but it was Doofus the contractors fault\", that doesnt work, the Internet lynch mob wont hear the details and will kill Amys business. Then shes suing Mastercard for false light, a type of defamtion there the facts are true but are framed falsely. And defamation has much more serious consequences in Europe. Anyway, even a business not at fault has to pay for a PCIDSS audit. A business at fault has lots more problems, at the very least paying 5090 per customer to replace their cards. The simple fact is 80 of businesses in this situation go bankrupt at this point. Usually fraudsters make automated attacks using scripts they got from others. Only a few dozen attacks on sites succeed, and then they use other scripts to intercept payment data, which is all they want. They are cookie cutter scripts, and arent customized for each site, and cant go after whatever personal data is particular to that site. So in most cases all they get is payment data. Its also likely that primary data, like a cloud drive, photo collection or medical records, are kept in completely separate systems with separate security, unlikely to hack both at once even if the hacker is willing to put lots and lots of engineering effort into it. Most hackers are script kiddies, able to run scripts others provided but unable to hack on their own. So its likely that \"none was leaked\" is the reason they didnt give notification of private information leakage. Lastly, they cant get what you didnt upload. Site hacking is a well known phenomenon. A person who is concerned with privacy is cautious to not put things online that are too risky. Its also possible that this is blind guesswork on the part of VisaMC, and they havent positively identified any particular merchant, but are replacing your cards out of an abundance of caution."

Once you have it however, annual fees are usually very little, and the fees to buy that companies funds are usually zero if its a noload company Vanguard, TRowPrice, etc With the larger companies that means you have a pretty large selection of funds, but generally EACH fund has a minimum initial purchase, once thats met then you can buy additional amounts in small quantities without a problem. For someone on a smaller budget, many low cost brokers ETrade as mentioned by Litteadv, Scottrade as mentioned by myself in another similar question today allow you to start with smaller initial balances and have a small selection of funds or ETFs that you can trade from without commission. In the case of Scottrade, they have like 15 ETFs that you can trade comission free. Check with the various low cost brokerages such as ETrade, Scottrade, and TDAmeritrade, to see what their policies are, and what if any fundsETFs they allow you to trade in without commissions. Keep in mind that for Mutual funds, there may still be a fund minimum initial investment that applies, be sure to check if that is the case or not. The lack of any minimum investment makes ETFs a slightly more attractive option for someone who doesnt have the buy in that many funds require."

    "content": "Like a lot of businesses, they win on the averages, which means lucrative customers subsidize the moneylosers. This is par for the course. Its the health club model. The people who show up everyday are subsidized by the people who never show but are too guilty to cancel. When I sent 2 DVDs a day to Netflix, they lost their shirt on me, and made it up on the customers who dont. In those \"free to play\" MMOs, actually 9599 of the players never pay and are carried by the 15 who spend significantly. In business thinking, the overall marketing cost of acquiring a new customer is pretty big  50 to 500. On the other side of the credit card swiper, they pay 600 bounty for new merchant customers  there are salesmen who live on converting 23 merchants a month. Thats because as a rule, customers tend to lockin. Thats why dotcoms lose millions for years giving you a free service. Eventually they figure out a revenue model, and you stay with it despite the new ads, because changing is inconvenient. When you want to do a banking transaction, they must provide the means to do that. Normal banks have the staggering cost of a huge network of branch offices where you can walk in and hand a check to a teller. The whole point of an ATM is to reduce the cost of that. Chase has 3 staffed locations in my zipcode and 6 ATMs. Schwab has 3 locations in my greater metro, which contains over 400 zipcodes. If youre in a onehorse town like French Lick, Bandera or Detroit, no Schwab for miles. So for Schwab, a 3 ATM fee isnt expensive, its cheap  compared to the cost of serving you any other way. There may also be behindthescenes agreements where the bank that charged you 3 refunds some of it to Schwab after they refund you. It doesnt really cost 3 to do a foreign ATM transaction. Most debit cards have a Visa or Mastercard logo. Many places will let you run it as an ATM card with a PIN entry. However everyone who takes VisaMC must take it as a credit card using a signature. In that case, the merchant pays 210 depending on several factors. Of this, about 1.4 goes to the issuing bank. This is meant to cover the banks risk of credit card defaults. But drawing from a bank account where they can decline if the money isnt there, that risk is low so its mostly gravy. You may find Schwab is doing OK on that alone. Also, dont use debit cards at any but the most trusted shops  unless you fully understand how, in fraud situations, credit cards and debit cards compare  and are comfortable with the increased risks.  there are literally dozens of microfees depending on their volume, swipe vs chip, ATM vs credit, rewards cards, fixed vs online vs mobile, etc. Home Depot does OK, the food vendor at the Renaissance Faire gets slaughtered. This kind of horsepuckey is why smallvendor services like Square are becoming hugely popular they flatrate everything at around 2.7. Yay!"

    "content": "That depends on how youre investing in them. Trading bonds is arguably riskier than trading stocks because it has a lot of the same risks associated with stocks plus interest rate and inflation risk. Thats true whether its a recession or not. Holding bonds to maturity may or may not be recessionproof or, perhaps more accurately, \"low risk\" as argued by DepressedDaniel, depending on what kind of bonds they are. If you own bonds in stable governments e.g. U.S. or German bonds or bonds in certain states or municipalities or highly stable corporations, theres a very low risk of default even in a recession. You didnt see companies like Microsoft, Google, or Apple going under during the 2008 crash. Thats absolutely not the case for all kinds of bonds, though, especially if youre concerned about systemic risk. Just because a bond looks riskfree doesnt mean that it actually is  look how many AAArated securities went under during the 2008 recession. And many companies CIT, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt outright. To assess your exposure to risk, you have to look at a lot of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the business, how \"recessionproof\" their product is, what kind of security or insurance youre being offered, etc. You cant even assume that bond insurance is an absolute guarantee against systemic risk  thats what got AIG into trouble, in fact. They were writing Credit Default Swaps CDS, which are analogous to insurance on loans  basically, the seller of the CDS \"insures\" the debt promises some kind of payment if a particular borrower defaults. When the entire credit market seized up, people naturally started asking AIG to make good on their agreement and compensate them for the loans that went bad unfortunately, AIG didnt have the money and couldnt borrow it themselves hence the government bailout. To address the whole issue of a company going bankrupt its not necessarily the case that your bonds would be completely worthless so I disagree with the people who implied that this would be the case. Theyd probably be worth a lot less than you paid for them originally, though possibly as bad as pennies on the dollar depending on how much under water the company was. Also, depending on how long it takes to work out a deal that everyone could agree to, my understanding is that it could take a long time before you see any of your money. I think its also possible that youll get some of the money as equity rather than cash  in fact, thats how the U.S. government ended up owning a lot of Chrysler they were Chryslers largest lender when they went bankrupt, so the government ended up getting a lot of equity in the business as part of the settlement. Incidentally, there is a market for securities in bankrupt companies for people that dont have time to wait for the bankruptcy settlement. Naturally, people who buy securities that are in that much trouble generally expect a steep discount. To summarize"

    "content": "You can have a positive expected return on a lottery ticket purchase, but only if the lottery requires all players to pick their own numbers and doesnt have an option to buy a ticket with a randomly generated set of numbers. This is because people are very bad at picking random numbers, and will tend to pick numbers that are fairly evenly spaced or based on dates rather than genuinely random numbers. For example in January 1995 the UK national lottery happened to have fairly wellspaced numbers 7, 17, 23, 32, 38  42, and there were 133 winners with all six numbers. So they way to win is to wait for a draw where a rollover jackpot is high enough that your expected winnings are positive if you are the only winner, and pick a set of numbers that looks stupidly nonrandom, but is not so very nonrandom that people will have picked it anyway, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For a \"pick 6 in the range from 149\" lottery you might pick something like 3, 42, 43, 44, 48, 49. But it doesnt work if theres a random option, since a significant number of players will use it and get genuinely random numbers, and so your chances of being the only winner get much smaller."

Carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns. To truly understand a text like The Intelligent Investor, you need to understand finance and accounting. For example, the price to earnings ratio is the equity value of an enterprise total shares outstanding times price per share divided by the earnings of the business. At a high level, earnings are just revenue, less COGS, less operating expenses, less taxes and interest. Earnings depend on a companys revenue recognition, inventory accounting methods FIFO, LIFO, purchase price allocations from acquisitions, etc. If you dont have a business degree  business background, I dont think books are going to provide you with the requisite knowledge unless you have the discipline to read textbooks.

    "content": "Disclaimer I am a law student, not a lawyer, and dont claim to have a legal opinion one way or another. My answer is intended to provide a few potentially relevant examples from case law in order to make the point that you should be cautious and seek proper advice if you think that caution is warranted. Nor am I claiming that the facts in these cases are the same as yours merely that they highlight the flexible approach that the courts take in such cases, and the fact that this area of law is complicated. I dont think it is sensible to just assume that there is no way that your girlfriend could acquire property rights as a rent paying tenant if arranged on an informal basis with no evidence of the intention of the arrangement. One of the answers mentions a bill which is intended to give nonmarried partners more rights than they have presently. But the existence of that bill doesnt prove the absence of any existing law, it merely suggests a possible legal position that might exist in the future. A worstcase assumption should also be made here, since youre considering the possibility of what can go wrong. So lets say for the sake of the argument that you have a horrible break up and your girlfriend is willing to be dishonest about what the intentions were regarding the flat e.g. will claim that she understood the arrangement to be that she would acquire ownership rights in exchange for paying two thirds of the monthly mortgage repayment. Grant v Edwards [1986] Ch 638  Defendant had property in the name of himself and his brother. Claimant paid nothing towards the purchase price or towards mortgage payments, but paid various outgoings and expenses. The court found a constructive trust in favor of the claimant, who received a 50 beneficial interest in the property. Abbot v Abbot [2007] UKPC 53, [2008] 1 FLR 1451  Defendants mother gifted land to a couple with the intention that it be used as a matrimonial home. However it was only put into the defendants name. The mortgage was paid from a joint account. The claimant was awarded a 50 share. Thompson v Hurst [2012] EWCA Civ 1752, [2014] 1 FLR 238  Defendant was a council tenant. Later, she formed a relationship with the claimant. They subsequently decided to buy the house from the council, but it was done in the defendants name. The defendant had paid all the rent while a tenant, and all the mortgage payments while an owner, as well as all utility bills. The claimant sometimes contributed towards the council tax and varying amounts towards general household expenses housekeeping, children, etc.. During some periods he paid nothing at all, and at other times he did work around the house. Claimant awarded 10 ownership. Aspden v Elvy [2012] EWHC 1387 Ch, [2012] 2 FCR 435  The defendant purchased a property in her sole name 10 years after the couple had separated. The claimant helped her convert the property into a house. He did much of the manual work himself, lent his machinery, and contributed financially to the costs. He was awarded a 25 share. Leeds Building Society v York [2015] EWCA Civ 72, [2015] HLR 26 p 532  Miss York and Mr York had a dysfunctional and abusive relationship and lived together from 1976 until his death in 2009. In 1983 Mr York bought a house with a mortgage. He paid the monthly mortgage repayments and other outgoings. At varous times Miss York contributed her earnings towards household expenses, but the judge held that this did \"not amount to much\" over the 33 year period, albeit it had helped Mr York being able to afford the purchase in the first place. She also cooked all the family meals and cared for the daughter. She was awarded a 25 share. Conclusion Dont make assumptions, consider posting a question on httpslaw.stackexchange.com , consider legal advice, and consider having a formal contract in place which states the exact intentions of the parties. It is a general principle of these kinds of cases that the parties need to have intended for the person lacking legal title to acquire a beneficial interest, and proof to the contrary should make such a claim likely to fail. Alternatively, decide that the risk is low and that its not worth worrying about. But make a considered decision either way."

This is adding in the swings that the market will take that at times may be a bit of a rude surprise to some people. Are all these prognosticators vastly underestimating how much savers need to be socking away by overstating what is realistic in terms of growth in investment markets? Possibly but not probably.

    "topic": "Is there a good rule of thumb for how much I should have set aside as emergency cash?",
    "content": "Since its not tagged unitedstates, Id like to offer a more general advice. Your emergency fund should match the financial risks that are relevant to you. The two main classes of financial risk are of course a sudden increase in costs or a decrease in income. Youd have to address both independently. First, loss of income. For most, this would simply equate to the loss of a job. How much benefits would you expect to get, and for how long? This is often the most important question the 6 months advise in the US is based on a lack of benefits. With two incomes, youre less likely to lose both jobs at the same time. Thats a general advise, though. If you both work for the same employer, the risk of losing two jobs at the same time is certainly real. Also, in countries with little protection against dismissal such as the US, the chance of being layed off at the same time is also higher. On the debit side, there are also two main risks. The first is the loss or failure of an essential possession, i.e. one which requires immediate replacement. This could include a car, or a washing machine. You already paid for one before, so you should have a good idea how much it costs. The second expenditure risk is healthrelated costs. Those can suddenly crop up, but often you have some kind of insurance. If not, youd need to account for some costs, but its hard to come up with an objective number here. The two categories are dependent, of course. Healthrelated costs may very well coincide with a loss of income, especially if youre selfemployed. Now, once youve figured out what the risks are, its time to figure out how to insure against them. Insurance might be a better choice than an emergency fund, especially for the health costs. You might even discover that you dont need an emergency fund at all. In large parts of Europe, you could establish a credit margin thats not easily revoked i.e. overdraft agreements, and unemployment benefits are sufficient to cover your regular cost of living. The main risk would then be a sudden lack of liquidity if your employer goes bankrupt and fails to pay the monthly wages, which means your credit should be guaranteed sufficient to borrow one month of expenses. This of course assumes quite good credit \"pay off my car\" doesnt suggest that."

If on the other hand you combine two correlated assets into a portfolio you are doubling down on the same assumption, which means you are not reducing your risk.

    "content": "There are 2 maxims that help make sense of insurance Following those 2 rules, \"normal\" insurance makes sense. Cant afford to replace your car? insure it. Can afford to lose your TV? Dont insure it. People with a net worth in the low millions have very similar insurance needs to the middle class. For example, they might be able to afford a new car when they total it, but they probably cant afford to pay for the long term care of the person they accidentally ran over. Similarly, they probably need to insure their million dollar house, just like average people insure more affordable housing. \"Very wealthy\" people still have the same basic choices, but for different assets. If you are a billionaire, then you might not bother to insure your 30k childhood home or your fleet vehicles, but you probably would insure your 250m mansion, your 100m yacht and your more pricey collectible cars. Its also worth noting that \"very wealthy\" people are at much higher risk of being sued for negligence or personal injury. As such, they are more likely to purchase personal liability or umbrella insurance coverage to protect against such risks. Multimilliondollar personal injury suits would never be filed against a poorer person simply because they couldnt afford to pay even the plaintiffs lawyer fees when they lost the court case. Insurance also makes sense when the insurance company is likely to grossly underestimate the risk they are taking. For example, if I am a really bad driver, but i have a clean record thanks to my army of lawyers, then insurance might actually be a good deal for me even on average. To take the \"very wealthy\" stereotypes to the extreme, perhaps my eccentric billionaire neighbor and I are in an escalating feud which I think will result in my butler \"accidentally\" running his car into my neighbors precious 1961 Ferrari."

The difference between the amount of interest paid on the loan, and the amount they could have got by investing it elsewhere, is simply a reduction in the profit.

I rebuilt my credit by using fingerhut. small credit limit on a cap 1 credit card 300 dollars unsecured card. personal loan of 1500 dollars to buy a old clunk for a car as I did not want to have five years of car payments. you can also get a secured credit card. and build credit with that. the bank will explain how to build credit using your own money. also you should know a lot of banks like your bankrupt stat. because they no you cant file for several more years. meaning if you dont pay your loan they can garnish you and you cant file bankrupt. you can get a new car loan with good interest rate. by taking 5000 dollars of your 15000 dollars savings down on the new loan. making your new car loan have better payments cheaper and better interest. and get a secured credit card of 2000 to build towards a unsecured credit card. keep all your new credit tabs small and pay on time.i would not use all your nest egg savings. that is not smart. get a lawyer and file. stay in school you will have a fresh start and you learned about upside down loans. dont listen to people trying to tell you bankruptsy is bad. it in a lot of ways gives you the upper hand in a no win debt or debts."

    "content": "Well for a start funds dont pay interest. If you pick an incomepaying fund as opposed to one that automatically reinvests any income for you you will receive periodic income based on the dividends paid by the underlying stocks, but it wont be the steady predictable interest payment you might get from a savings account or fixedrate security. This income is not guaranteed and will vary based on the performance of the companies making up the fund. Its also quite likely that the income by itself wont cover the interest on your mortgage. The gains from stock market investment come from a mixture of dividends and capital growth i.e. the increase in the price of the shares. So you may have to sell units now and again or cover part of the interest payments from other income. Youre basically betting that the aftertax returns from the fund will be greater than the mortgage interest rate youre paying. 3 facts If youre comfortable with these 3 facts, go for it.

Interest paid on passive investments can be deducted from the amount earned by that investment as an investment expense as long as the amount earned is greater than the total paid for the interest expense. Also beware if the amount of interest paid is greater than the yearly gift tax exclusion, as the IRS might interpret this as a creative way of giving gifts to your father without paying gift tax. Do you pay taxes on the interest you pay? No, because is an expense, not income, you would not count interest paid to him as taxable income. Does your father owe taxes on the interest he collects from you? Yes, that is income to him. And the last question you didnt ask, but I expect it is implied Do you owe taxes on the quarterly profits? Yes, that is income to you. The Forbes article How To Arrange A Loan Between Family Members is a bit dated, but still a good source of information. You really should write a formal note signed by both you and your father indicating the amount borrowed, the interest rate you are paying on that amount, and when the loan will be repaid. If your father has set the interest rate too low, this could also be considered a gift to you, though we would really be talking about large amounts of money to hit the gift tax limit on interest alone."

    "content": "You seem to have a little confusion over terminology that should be cleared up You are calling this \"daytrading\" Daytrading is the term for performing multiple trading actions in a single day. While it appears that the COO has performed a buy and a sell on the same day, most people would consider this a single trade. In reality, it seems that the COO had stock options [a contract providing the option for the holder to buy stock at a specific price, at some point in the future], provided as part of his compensation package. He decided or was required to exercise those options today. This means he bought the shares using his special option price. It is extremely common for employees who exercise stock options, to sell all of the resulting stock immediately. This is very different from usual daytrading, which implies that he would have bought stock in the morning at a low price, and then sold it later at a high price. You are calling this insider trading. That term specifically often implies some level of unethical behavior. In general, stock options offered to executive employees are strictly limited in how they can be exercised. For example, most stock option plans require employees to wait x number of years before they can exercise them. This gives the employee incentive to stay longer, and for a highlevel executive with the ability to strongly impact company performance, it gives incentive to do well. Technically you are correct, this is likely considered an insider trade, but given that it seems to have been a stock option exercise, it does not necessarily imply that there was any special reasoning for why he did the trade today. It could simply be that today was the first day the stock option rules allowed him to exercise. As to your final question  no, these profits are the COOs, to do with as he likes."

    "content": "The whole point of the \"envelope system\" as I understand it is that it makes it easy to see that you are staying within your budget If the envelope still has cash in it, then you still have money to spend on that budget category. If you did this with a bunch of debit cards, you would have to have a way to quickly and easily see the balance on that card for it to work. There is no physical envelope to look in. If your bank lets you check your balance with a cellphone app I guess that would work. But at that point, why do you need separate debit cards? Just create a spreadsheet and update the numbers as you spend. The balance the bank shows is always going to be a little bit behind, because it takes time for transactions to make it through the system. Ive seen on my credit cards that sometimes transactions show up the same day, but other times they can take several days or even a week or more. So keeping a spreadsheet would be more accurate, or at least, more timely. But all that said, I can check my bank balance and my credit card balances on web sites. Ive never had a desire to check from a cell phone but at least some banks have such apps  my daughter tells me she regularly checks her credit card balance from her cell phone. So I dont see why you couldnt do it with offtheshelf technology. Side not, not really related to your question I dont really see the point of the envelope system. Personally, I keep my checkbook electronically, using a little accounting app that I wrote myself so its customized to my needs. I enter fixed bills, like insurance premiums and the mortgage payment, about a month in advance, so I can see that that money is already spoken for and just when it is going out. Besides that, whats the advantage of saying that you allot, say, 50 per month for clothes and 100 for gas for the car and 60 for snacks, and if you use up all your gas money this month than you cant drive anywhere even though you have money left in the clothes and snack envelopes? I mean, it makes good sense to say, \"The mortgage payment is due next week so I cant spend that money on entertainment, I have to keep it to pay the mortgage.\" But I dont see the point in saying, \"I cant buy new shoes because the shoe envelope is empty. Ive accumulated 5000 in the shampoo account since I went bald and dont use shampoo any more, but that money is off limits for shoes because its allocated to shampoo.\""

    "topic": "How will the New credit reporting rules affect people who are already struggling financially?",
    "content": "From my understanding by paying your bills more than 5 days late will not lead you into bankruptcy or stop you from getting a new loan in the future, however it may mean that lenders offer you credit at a higher interest rate. This of course would not help you as you are already struggling with your finances. However, no matter how bad you think things might be for you financially, there are always things you can do to improve your situation. Set a Budget The first thing you must do is to set a budget. List down all sources of income you receive each month, including any allowances. Then list all your sources of expenses and spending. List all your bills such as rent, telephone, electricity, car maintenance, credit card and other loans. Keep a diary for a month for all your discretionary spending  including coffees, lunches, and other odd bits and ends. You can also talk with your existing lenders and come to some agreement on reducing you interest rates on your debts and the repayments. But remember any reduction in repayments may increase your repayment period and the total interest you have to pay in the long term. If you need help setting up your budget here are some links to resources you can download to help you get started Once you set up your budget you want your total income to be more than your total expenses. If it isnt you will be getting further and further behind each month. Some things you can do are to increase your income  get a jobsecond job, sell some unwanted items, or start a small home business. Some things you can do to reduce your expenses  make coffees and lunches at home before going out and buying these, pay off higher interest debts first, consolidate all your debts into a lower interest rate loan, reduce discretionary spending to an absolute minimum, cancel all unnecessary services, etc. Debt Consolidation In regards to a Debt Consolidation for your existing personal loans and credit cards into a single lower interest rate loan can be a good idea, but there are some pitfalls you should consider. Manly, if you are taking out a loan with a lower interest rate but a longer term to pay it off, you may end up paying less in monthly repayments but will end up paying more interest in the long run. If you do take this course of action try to keep your term to no longer than your current debts terms, and try to keep your repayments as high as possible to pay the debt off as soon as possible and reduce any interest you have to pay. Again be wary of the fine print and read the PDS of any products you are thinking of getting. Refer to ASIC  Money Smart website for more valuable information you should consider before taking out any debt consolidation. Assistance improving your skills and getting a higher paid job If you are finding it hard to get a job, especially one that pays a bit more, look into your options of doing a course and improving your skills. There is plenty of assistance available for those wanting to improve their skills in order to improve their chances of getting a better job. Check out Centrelinks website for more information on Payments for students and trainees. Other Action You Can Take If you are finding that the repayments are really getting out of hand and no one will help you with any debt consolidation or reducing your interest rates on your debts, as a last resort you can apply for a Part 9 debt agreement. But be very careful as this is an alternative to bankruptcy, and like bankruptcy a debt agreement will appear on your credit file for seven years and your name will be listed on the National Personal Insolvency Index forever.

    "topic": "Why do stocks go up? Is it due to companies performing well, or what else? [duplicate]",
    "content": "The same applies if you were looking for a business to buy would you pay more for a business that is doing well making increasing profits year after year, or for a business that is not doing so well and is losing money. A share in a company is basically a small part of a company which a shareholder can own. So would you rather own a part of a company that is increasing profits year after year or one that is continuously losing money? Someone would buy shares in a company in order to make a better return than they could make elsewhere. They can make a profit through two ways first, a share of the companys profits through dividends, and second capital gains from the price of the shares going up. Why does the price of the shares go up over the long term when a company does well and increases profits? Because when a company increases profits they are making more and more money which increases the net worth of the company. More investors would prefer to buy shares in a company that makes increasing profits because this will increase the net worth of the company, and in turn will drive the share price higher over the long term. A companys increase in profits creates higher demand for the companys shares. Think about it, if interest rates are so low like they are now, where it is hard to get a return higher than inflation, why wouldnt investors then search for higher returns in good performing companies in the stock market? More investors and traders wanting some of the pie, creates higher demand for good performing stocks driving the share price higher. The demand for these companies is there primarily because the companies are increasing their profits and net worth, so over the long term the share price will increase inline with the net worth. Over the short to medium term other factors can also affect the share price, sometime opposite to how the company is actually performing however this is a whole different answer to a whole different question."

Would you expect the system to look into future and decide that this is a one time dip, and not sell versus it is a crash, and sell? Either way, the system cannot look in the future, so it has no way to know if a crash is coming, or if it was a short dip therefore the instrcutions are executed as given  sell if any transfer happens below the limit. To avoid that or at least reduce the chance for it, you can either leave more distance and risk a higher loss when it crashes, or trade higher volumes, so the short small dip wont execute your order also, very liquid stocks will not show such small transaction dips."

    "content": "A futures contract is based upon a particular delivery date. In the case of a stock index futures contract is a cash settled futures contract based upon the stock index value at a particular point in time i.e. this is when the final settlement is determined. In your example, the SP 500 SPX is a price return index  that is, it is not affected by dividends and therefore dividends are not incorporated into the index value. Dividends will affect the price of the constituent stocks not necessarily by the same amount as the dividend so they do have influence on the stock index value. Since the dividends are known ahead of time or at least can be estimated, this has already been factored into the futures price by the market. In terms of the impact of a dividend by AAPL, AAPL is approximaetely 3.6 of the index. Apple pays out dividends 4 times a year currently paying out 0.52 dividends. Assuming the market is otherwise steady and AAPL drops by 0.52 due to the dividend and Apple is priced at around 105, this would result in a drop in the index of 0.0178 or around 0.35 points. Interesting fact There are some futures contracts that are based upon Total Return indexes, such as the German DAX and the above logic would need to be reversed."

If a taxpayer expects to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than during the working years, then this is one advantage for using a Traditional IRA vs a Roth. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income. So it depends on your tax bracket UPDATE FOR COMMENT Currently you may have heard on the news about \"the fiscal cliff\"  CNBC at the end of the year. This is due to the fact that the Bush taxcuts are set to expire and if they expire. Many tax rates will change. But here is the info as of right now Dividends From 2003 to 2007, qualified dividends were taxed at 15 or 5 depending on the individuals ordinary income tax bracket, and from 2008 to 2012, the tax rate on qualified dividends was reduced to 0 for taxpayers in the 10 and 15 ordinary income tax brackets. After 2012, dividends will be taxed at the taxpayers ordinary income tax rate, regardless of his or her tax bracket.  If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire.  Reference  Wikipedia Capital Gains tax rates can be seen here  the Capital Gains tax rate is relative to your Ordinary Income tax rate For Example this year long term gains will be 0 if you fall in the 15 ordinary tax bracket.

Consequently, if your portfolio is large enough to make transaction fees a very small percentage rate, this is a viable investment strategy. However, as the preferred tax rate for dividends typically will catch up to that for capital gains at some cutoff point, there is a natural limit on how much income can be favourably obtained in this way.

This helps ensure that your total tax burden does not increase measurably from crossing a tax bracket. Be aware that you can still see measurable changes in your total taxes due if increases in income make you no longer eligible for certain deductions andor benefits that were otherwise reducing your tax burden, but this is not the same as how changes in your highest marginal rate affect your overall average tax rate. Note that when you see a rate table such as the one on efile.coms federal income tax rates page or on Wikipedias Income tax in the United States page, the rates listed are for each segment of income, not for your overall income In other words the 15 rate below for 2014, filing single only applies to the portion of your income falling between the listed numbers, not to income below it or above it that would be calculated under the respective rates given. You can use the i1040tt tax tables to gain a sense of how this works in practice The linked resource is for 2014 taxes The threshold in 2014 for the 25 rate vs 15 was 36,900.

    "content": "Will there be a scenario in which I want to sell, but nobody wants to buy from me and Im stuck at the brokerage website? Similarly, if nobody wants to sell their stocks, I will not be able to buy at all? Youre thinking of this as a normal purchase, but thats not really how US stock markets operate. First, just because there are shares of stock purchased, it doesnt mean that there was real investor buyer and seller demand for that instrument at that point in time. Markets have dedicated middlemen called Market Makers NASDAQ or Specialists NYSE, who are responsible to make sure that there is always someone to buy or sell this ensures that all instruments have sufficient liquidity. Market Makers and specialists may decide to lower their bid on a stock based on a high number of sellers, or raise their ask for a high number of buyers. During an investor rush to buy or sell an instrument perhaps in response to a news release, its possible for the Market Maker  specialist to accumulate or distribute a large number of shares, without endinvestors like you or I being involved on both sides of the same transaction."

    "topic": "Getting started in stock with one special field of activity",
    "content": "It depends on what youre talking about. If this is for your retirement accounts, like IRAs, then ABSOLUTELY NOT! In your retirement accounts you should be broadly diversified  not just between stocks, but also other markets like bonds. Target retirement funds and solid conservative or moderate allocation funds are the best quickanddirty recommendation for those accounts. Since its for the long haul, you want to be managing risk, not chasing returns. Returns will happen over the 40 or so years they have to grow. Now, if youre talking about a taxable stock account, and youve gotten past PF questions like \"am I saving enough for retirement\", and \"have I paid off my debt\", then the question becomes a little more murky. First, yes, you should be diversified. The bulk of how a stocks movement will be in keeping with how its sector moves so even a really great stock can get creamed if its sector is going down. Diversification between several sectors will help balance that. However, you will have some advantage in this sector. Knowing which products are good, which products everybody in the industry is excited about, is a huge advantage over other investors. Itll help you pick the ones that go up more when the sector goes up, and down less when the sector goes down. That, over time and investments, really adds up. Just remember that a good company and a good stock investment are not the same thing. A great company can have a skyhigh valuation  and if you buy it at that price, you can sit there and watch your investment sink even as the company is growing and doing great things. Have patience, know which companies are good and which are bad, and wait for the price to come to you. One final note it also depends on what spot you are in. If youre a young guy looking looking to invest his first few thousand in the market, then go for it. On the other hand, if youre older, and were talking about a couple hundred grand youve got saved up, then its a whole different ball of wax. It that spot, youre back to managing risk, and need to build a solid portfolio, at a measured pace."

    "topic": "Explanations on credit cards in Canada",
    "content": "Is my understanding okay ? If so, it seems to me that this system is rather error prone. By that I mean I could easily forget to make a wire some day and be charged interests while I actually have more than enough money on the check account to pay the debt. Which is where the credit card company can add fees so you pay more and they make more money. Dont forget that in the credit case, you are borrowing money rather than using your own. Another thing that bothers me is that the credit card apparently has a rather low credit limit. If I wanted to buy something that costs 2500 but only have a credit limit of 1500, can I make a preemptive wire from my check account to the VISA account to avoid facing the limit ? If so, what is the point for the customer of having two accounts and two cards for that matter... ? If you were the credit card company, do you believe people should be given large limits first? There are prepaid credit cards where you could put a dollar amount on and it would reject if the balance gets low enough. Iridium Prepaid MasterCard would be an example here that I received one last year as I was involved in the floods in my area and needed access to government assistance which was given this way. Part of the point of building up a credit history is that this is part of how one can get the credit limits increased on cards so that one can have a higher limit after demonstrating that they will pay it back and otherwise the system could be abused. There may be a risk that if you prepay onto a credit card and then want to take back the money that there may be fees involved in the transaction. Generally, with credit cards the company makes money on the fees involved for transactions which may come from merchants or yourself as a cash advance on a credit card will be charged interest right away while if you buy merchandise in a store there may not be the interest charged right away."

    "topic": "What are the costs to establish an LLC and to maintain it?",
    "content": "Ill answer in general terms, since Im not familiar with the price ranges in Florida. The LLC formation costs 125 state fee. In addition youll need a registered agent. Registered agent could be your CPAEAbookkeeperproperty managerlocal friend, or you can pay firms specializing in providing registration and agents services such as NorthWestern or LegalZoom there are many others. Youll need to pay an annual fee of 140 in Florida. If you are using someone to do the formation, theyll charge more usually the online services are cheaper than a local CPA or attorney, by 100300. Bookkeeping will probably be charged by the hour, but some bookkeepers charge flat fees for small accounts. Per hour would be probably in the range of 4080. Youll have to pay taxes  both in Florida where the property is and on the Federal level to the IRS. Youll be paying them as a nonResident individual. Your CPAEA will charge you anywhere between 150 to 500 for that if they charge more  run away, unless theres some specific complication that requires extra costs. You will need a ITIN for that, your CPAEA can help you get one or you can apply yourself. Be careful with all those people selling crp about organizing in DelawareWyomingNevada like CQM in his answer. Organizing in a state other than where the properties are located or offshore wont save you a dime, and not only that  it will add to the costs. Because youll have to pay to the state where you organized CQM mentioned Wyoming  50year, keep registered agent in the state of organization 99 and also do all the things Ive described above about Florida  as a \"Foreign\" out of state entity, which may mean higher fees. It wont save you any taxes as well, because you pay taxes to the state from which you derive income, which is Florida, either way. Remember that what you call LLC in Italy may be in fact a \"Corporation\" as defined in the US, and theres a huge difference. You should probably not put a realestate property in a Corporation in the US. You must get a legal advice from a Florida lawyer 0500hr consultation, and a tax advice from a Florida CPAEA 0200hr consultation. Do not consider anything I write here as a legal or tax advice, because it is not. You need a professional to help you because as an Italian, you dont know how things work exactly and relying on rumours and halftruths that you may find and get over the Internet may end up costing you significantly in damages.

Thats about 26,000 miles a year if I do nothing but drive back and forth to work. On a monthly basis the lease is advertised as being less than most payments, but that is with a mileage limitation. Since most leases Ive looked at top out the mileage well below that mark I wont be leasing. I am looking at the new cars that are available now  but I dont plan on buying until next year, and buying a lightly used car that is only a year to two old.

    "topic": "What is the difference between good debt vs. bad debt?",
    "content": "I think people are conflating two orthogonal sets of terms. Unsecuredsecured and goodbad are not synonyms. Debt may be secured or unsecured. If I take a loan against a car or house it is typically secured, so the object is collateral against the loan. Bad debt in financial terms is a loan that is not expected to be recovered. A bank might write off a loan or a portion of a loan as bad debt if the borrower goes bankrupt or into administration for example. Both secured and unsecured loans may be considered bad debt. I think the context in which the question is being asked is how to distinguish between sensible and inadvisable borrowing. An extreme example of inadvisable borrowing would be to buy a PC on a store card. PCs devalue very quickly and a store card may charge 30 APR, so paying the minimum off each month would mean paying more than twice the sticker price for a product that is now worth less than half the original borrowed amount. On the other hand, a 3 mortgage when borrowing less than 60 of the value of a property is a good bet from a lenders perspective, and would be a good debt to have not as good as no debt, but better thhan a high APR one."

The Nest covers this in detail The IRS only allows you to deduct charitable contributions that you personally funded, whether the contribution was made in your name or in someone elses. If your child or dependent makes a donation to a charity, you are not allowed to claim it as a tax deduction. This is true even if your dependent does not claim the contribution on his own tax return because he opts for the standard deduction rather than itemizing or claims exemption. Now, had you constructed the transaction differently, its possible you couldve made the contribution in your childs name and thus claimed the deduction. Allowance is technically a gift, and if she agrees to forgo allowance in exchange for you making a contribution, well, the IRS cant really complain though they might try if it were a large amount!. Contributions in the name of someone else, but funded by yourself, are deductible [Y]ou can deduct contributions you make in someone elses name. So if you donated a certain amount of money to XYZ charity in your childs name, for example, you would be able to deduct this amount on your taxes, as long as the deduction requirements are met.

I am assuming this means that every other Friday, the company is going into the open public market, buying those shares and then giving it out to the employees. No. Companies will internally hold shares that it intends to offer employees as additional compensation. There are no open market transactions, so the market price of the stock does not change at least not due to buying pressure. The only net effect is an equivalent expense for the compensation, but that should already be accounted for in the share price as normal operating expenses. These share may come through an initial buyback from the market, but more common is that when companies issue new shares they keep some internally for exactly this situation. If they issued new shares every pay period, it would dilute the existing shares several times a quarter which would be difficult to account for."

However, I think trying to exactly replicate the Gone Fishin Portfolio in Australia would not be a good move for most people, for a few reasons Brokerage and management fees are generally higher in Australia smaller market, so dividing your investment across ten different securities, and rebalancing, is going to be somewhat more expensive. If you have a \"middleclasssized\" portfolio of somewhere in the tens of thousands to low millions of dollars, youre cutting it into fairly small slices to manually allocate 5 to various sectors.

If you are earning and spending Australian dollars, and looking at the portfolio in Australian dollars, a lot of those assets are going to move together as the Australian dollar moves, regardless of changes in the underlying assets. So there is effectively less diversification than you would have in the US. The post doesnt mention the GFPs approach to tax. I expect they do consider it, but its not going to be directly applicable to Australia. If you are more interested in implementing the general approach of GFP rather than the specific details, what I would recommend is The Vanguard and superannuation diversified funds have a very similar internal split to the GFP with a mix of local, firstworld and emerging market shares, bonds, and property trusts. This is pretty much fireandforget contribute every month and they will take care of rebalancing, spreading across asset classes, and tax calculations. By my calculations the cost is very similar, the diversification is very similar, and its much easier. The only thing they dont generally cover is a precious metals allocation, and if you want that, just put 5 of your money into the ASXGOLD ETF, or something similar."

    "topic": "ESPP Share vs Payroll withholding",
    "content": "Note that youre asking about withholding, not about taxing. Withholding doesnt mean this is exactly the tax youll pay it means theyre withholding a certain amount to make sure you pay taxes on it, but the tax bill at the end of the year is the same regardless of how you choose to do the withholding. Your tax bill may be higher or lower than the withholding amount. As far as tax rate, that will be the same regardless  youre just moving the money from one place to the other. The only difference would be that your tax is based on total shares under the plan  meaning that if you buy 1k shares, for example, at 10, so 1,500 discounted income, if you go the payroll route you get say 375 withheld. If you go the share route, you either get 375 worth of stock so 38 shares withheld and then you would lose out on selling that stock, meaning you dont get quite as much out of it at the end or you would ask them to actually buy rather more shares to make up for it, meaning youd have a slightly higher total gain. That would involve a slightly higher tax at the end of it, of course. Option 1 Buy and then sell 10000 worth, sharebased withholding. Assuming 15 profit, and 10share at both points, then buysell 1000 shares, 1500 in profit to take into account, 38 shares worth 380 withheld. You put in 8500, you get back 9620, net 1120. Option 2 Buy and then sell 13500 worth, share based withholding. Same assumptions. You make about 2000 in pretax profit, meaning you owe about 500 in tax withholding. Put in 11475, get back 13000, net 1525. Owe 35 more tax at the end of the year, but you have the full 1500 to spend on whatever you are doing with it. Option 3 Buy and then sell 1000 worth, paycheck withholding. You get the full 100008500  1500 up front, but your next paycheck is 375 lighter. Same taxes as Option 1 at the end of the year."

The rate applied by his bank [and card provider, VisaMaster also take a cut] is the standard shelf rate to individuals. When business growing and banking becoming more sophisticated, lots of Merchant Banks and Merchants have created a new business, if you offer Shekel to all users then you have lots of Shekel that you can convert into USD. So in this model, the Merchant makes some more profit from Fx spread, the Merchant Bank makes good money in Fx. Your Bank [and card network] loose out. You stand to gain because you potentially get a better rate. All this theory is good.

    "content": "I personally invest in 4 different ETFs. I have 1000 to invest every month. To save on transaction costs, I invest that sum in only one ETF each month, the one that is most underweight at the time. For example, I invest in XIC 30, VTI 30, VEA 30, and VWO 10. One month, Ill buy XIC, next month VTA, next month, VEA, then XIC again. Eventually Ill buy VWO when its 1000 underweight. If one ETF tanks, I may buy it twice in a row to reach my target allocation, or if it shoots up, I may skip buying it for a while. My actual asset allocation never ends up looking exactly like the target, but it trends towards it. And I only pay one commission a month. If this is in a taxsheltered account main TFSA or RRSP, another option is to invest in noload index mutual funds that match the ETFs each month assuming theres no commission to buy them. Once they reach a certain amount, sell and buy the equivalent ETFs. This is not a good approach in a nonregistered account because you will have to pay tax on any capital gains when selling the mutual funds."

    "topic": "How often do typical investors really lose money?",
    "content": "So how often do investors really lose money? The short answer is, every day. Lets first examine your assumptions If the price of the share gets lower, the investor can just wait until it gets higher. What are the chances that it wont forever, or for years? There are many stocks whose price goes down and then down further and then to zero. The most apparent example is, of course, Enron. The stock went from about 90 per share to zero in about 18 months. For it to have been sold at 90, obviously, someone had to buy it. Almost no matter where they sold it, they lost money. If they didnt sell it, when the stock was worthless, they lost money. httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiEnronmediaFileEnronStockPriceAugust2000toJanuary2001.svg There are more modern examples of companies that are declining in a rapidly changing market. For example, Sears Holdings is getting beat down by Amazon and many other online retailers. I suspect that if you buy it today and wait for it to go higher, you will be disappointed. httpswww.google.comfinance?qNASDAQ3ASHLDeiE8fWIjWGsSGmAGx7bIAw The more common way to lose money is to either not have a plan or not stick to the plan. Disciplined investors typically plan to buy quality stocks at a fair price and hold them long enough for increasing sales and profits to bring the stock price up. If, later, he hears a bit of bad news about his stock and decides to sell out of panic or fear and become a trader instead of keeping to the plan to remain a disciplined investor, he is likely to lose money. He will lose because noone can predict accurately that a stock is going down and will never recover nor can he predict accurately when a stock is going up and will never falter. The chance of bankruptcy especially for huge companies like Apple is really low, as I see it, but I may be wrong. Thousands of people lost billions of dollars thinking that about Enron, too. I too believe Apple is a fine stock with excellent prospects, but technology changes and markets change. Twenty or thirty years from now, it may be a different case."

Eventually, it could become a primary income, and your strategic risk is overall relatively low. If you are diligent and patient, you are likely to succeed, but at a rate that is so slow that the primary beneficiaries of your efforts may be your children and their children. Which is good! It is a bad gameplan for building an \"empire.\" Why? Because you are not the first person in your town with this idea. Probably not even the first person on the block. And among those people, some will be willing to take far more extravagant risks. Some will be better capitalized to begin with. Some will have institutional history with the market along with all the access and insider information that comes with it. As far as we know, you have none of that. Any market condition that yields a profit for you in this space, will yield a larger one for them. In a downturn, they will be able to absorb larger losses than you. So, if your approach is to build an empire, you need to take on a considerably riskier approach, engage with the market in a more direct and timeconsuming way, and be prepared to deal with the consequences if those risks play out the wrong way."

He appears to discard timing and selection as impossible. A student kinda calls him out on this. Diversification reduces risk, not increase returns. It turns out they did time the market, by shorting .coms before the bubble, and real estate just before the downturn. In 1990, Yale started a \"Absolute Return\" unit and allocated like 15 percent to it, mostly by selling US equities, that specializes in these sorts of hedging moves. As for why you might employ managers for specific areas, consider that the expense ratio Wall Street charges you or me still represent a very nice salary when applied to the billions in Yales portfolio. So they hire internally to reduce expenses, and Im sure theyre kept busy. They also need people to sell off assets to maintain ratios, and figuring out which ones to sell might take specialized knowledge. Finally, in some areas, you functionally cannot invest without management. For example, Yale has a substantial allocation in private equity, and by definition that doesnt trade on the open market. The other thing you should consider is that for all its diversification, Yale lost 25 percent of their portfolio in 2009. For a technique thats supposed to reduce volatility, they seem to have a large range of returns over the past five years."

    "content": "Presumably the existing house has some value. If you demolish the existing house, you are destroying that value. If the value of the new house is significantly more than the value of the old house, like if youre talking about replacing a small, rundown old house worth 50,000 with a big new mansion worth 10,000,000, then the value of the old house that is destroyed might just get lost in the rounding errors for all practical purposes. But otherwise, I dont see how you would do this without bringing cash to the table basically equal to what you still owe on the old house. Presumably the new house is worth more than the old, so the value of the property when youre done will be more than it was before. But will the value of the property be more than the old mortgage plus the new mortgage? Unless the old mortgage was almost paid off, or you bring a bunch of cash, the answer is almost certainly \"no\". Note that from the lienholders point of view, you are not \"temporarily\" reducing the value of the property. You are permanently reducing it. The bank that makes the new loan will have a lien on the new house. I dont know what the law says about this, but you would have to either, a deliberately destroy property that someone else has a lien on while giving them no compensation, or b give two banks a lien on the same property. I wouldnt think either option would be legal. Normally when people tear down a building to put up a new building, its because the value of the old building is so low as to be negligible compared to the value of the new building. Either the old building is rundown and getting it into decent shape would cost more than tearing it down and putting up a new building, or at least there is some benefit  real or perceived  to the new building that makes this worth it."

If you discuss this kind of thing with your broke friends they will have negative feelings toward you. This is not necessarily a bad thing.

    "topic": "Is inflation a good or bad thing? Why do governments want some inflation?",
    "content": "Sensitive topic  Inflation is a consequence of the mismatch between supply and demand. In an ideal world the amount of goods available would exactly match the demand for those goods. We dont live in an ideal world. One example of oversupply is dollar stores where you can buy remainders from companies that misjudged demand. Most recently weve seen wheat prices rise as fires outside Moscow damaged the harvest and the Russian government banned exports. And that introduces the danger of inflation. Inflation is a signal, like the pain you feel after an injury. If you simply took a painkiller you may completely ignore a broken leg until gangrene took your life. Governments sometimes \"ban\" inflation by fixing prices. Both the Zimbabwean and Venezuelan governments have tried this recently. The consequence of that is goods become unavailable as producers refuse to create supply for less than the cost of production. As CrimonsX pointed out, governments do desperately want to avoid deflation as much as they want to avoid hyperinflation. There is a \"correct\" level and that has resulted in the monetary policy called \"Inflation targetting\" where central banks attempt to manage inflation into a target range usually around 2 to 6. The reason is simply that limited inflation drives investment and consumption. With a guaranteed return on investment people with cash will lend it to people with ideas. Consumers will buy goods today if they fear that the price will rise tomorrow. If prices fall as they have done during the two decades of deflation in Japan then the result is lower levels of investment and employment as companies cut production capacity. If prices rise to quickly as in Zimbabwe and Venezuela then people cannot save enough or earn enough and so their wealth is drained away. Add to this the continual process of innovation and you see how difficult it is to manage inflation at all. Innovation can result in increased efficiency which can reduce prices. It can also result in a new product which is sufficiently unique to allow predatory pricing the Apple iPhone, new types of medicines, and so on. The best mechanism we have for figuring out where money should be invested and who is the best recipient of any good is the price mechanism. Inflation is the signal that investors need to learn how best to manage their efforts. We hide from it at our peril."

So instead of lamenting that the grass is greener as all those BMWs whiz by, smile deeply and enjoy that feeling of sleeping well at night instead of stressing out about the next credit card bill and car payment waiting for you in the mailbox. And at the same time, if you really want a luxury car and want that to be a priority, you can make it happen and not go broke.

That being said, my personal reasons for having a liquid emergency fund revolve around bank errors and identify theft. I used to work for a company that made bank software. Errors are a common occurrence. Youd be surprised how many transactions are still input by human hands despite our computerized world. All it takes is one typo to wipe out your ability to swipe plastic for a few days. This has actually happened to me. My utility company sent me a bill for 240 and wound up taking 2400 by accident, overdrawing my account and sending me into a fee spiral. They fixed their mistake... several days later. The snowball of fees from other transactions that bounced took another two months to correct. In the meantime, I also had my mortgage payment due. In the US, you cant pay your mortgage with credit, and for those who rent, many landlords wont let you pay with credit either. I have also seen this scenario play out twice with other people Ive known whove had their ID stolen. Yes, the bank will cover the fraud after a lengthy process. But the disruption causes fees and overdrafts to quickly snowball out of control. I have a separate savings account at a different bank for this kind of thing, and I have a few hundred dollars cash in my house at all times.

Then the child pays their \"expenses\"  hockey fees and equipment, field trips, birthday presents for their friends and so on  out of the money the company paid them. They also save for their postsecondary education. The rest of the family budget now has a little more room, and the parents can lower their own salaries if they have expensive children. This means more net money in the company and less total income tax paid by the family for the same total income. My concern is that if your parents dont know whether or not you must be paid minimum wage you must, theres no family exemption then they also dont know whether you should have EI deducted probably not and various other special cases like eligibility for summer student subsidies.

If this ends up being a significant difference for you, Id argue the employer needs to correct both W2s, since youve actually received the money in 2014. However, if the difference for you is not substantial Id leave it as is and remember that the employer will not know of your ESPP sales until at least several days later when the report from the broker arrives.

    "content": "Depending on who you have the loan through and how they figure the interest charges whether daily, monthly, bimonthly, etc. normally monthly I would assume, your interest is probably figured either daily or once a month. Lets assume that it is figured daily, otherwise it wouldnt make sense to make biweekly payments. At 4 Annual Interest on a 150,000 home loan the interested added each day is about 16.44, but it doesnt stop there because it is compounding interest daily so the next day it becomes 4 of 150,0016.44 which is negligibly larger amount and they will tack on another 16.44. So what will happen is that the amount of interest you owe grows rather quickly, especially if you miss a monthly payment. Everyone knows that the faster you pay something off the less interest you pay, but not everyone knows the formula for compounding interest. a quick Google search rendered this site with a simple explanation Compound Interest Formula unfortunately this formula doesnt take into account the payments being made. The big thing with making your payments biweekly rather than a bigger payment once a month is that you pay off some of that principle right away and it wont collect interest for 14 more days. if the interest is only calculated once a month, make your full payment before the interest is calculated, the same goes for your credit cards."

    "content": "The short answer to your question is yes. Company performance affects stock price only through investors views. But note that selling for higher and lower prices when the company is doing well or poorly is not an arbitrary choice. A stock is a claim on the future cash flows of the firm, which ultimately come from its future profits. If the company is doing well, investors will likely expect that there will large cash flows dividends in the future and be willing to pay more to hold it or require more to sell it. The price of a stock is equal what people think the future dividends are worth. If market participants started behaving irrationally, like not reacting to changes in the expected future cash flows, then arbitrageurs would make a ton of money trading against them until the situation was rectified."

Some guidance on what constitutes \"reasonable cause\" is found on the IRS page Penalty Relief Due to Reasonable Cause The IRS will consider any sound reason for failing to file a tax return, make a deposit, or pay tax when due. Sound reasons, if established, include Note A lack of funds, in and of itself, is not reasonable cause for failure to file or pay on time. However, the reasons for the lack of funds may meet reasonable cause criteria for the failuretopay penalty. In this article from U.S. News and World Report, it is suggested that the IRS will generally waive the penalty one time, if you have a clean tax history and ask for the penalty to be waived. It is definitely worth asking them to waive the penalty."

    "content": "Johnny. I recently bought my first home as well, and I have worked in the credit business not mortgage, so I think I can answer some of your questions. Disclaimer first that Im in NY, and home buying does vary from state to state. In my experience, prequal is not too different from preapproval. Neither represents any real committment on the part of the bank i.e. they can still deny approval at any point, and both are based on pulling your credit bureau and calculating ratios based on your stated probably not documented financial information. Its theoretically possible that a seller would choose a preapproved buyer over a prequalified buyer, all other things being equal, but all other things are seldom equal. Remember also that you dont need to ultimately get a mortgage from the same bank that you use for the prequal. The prequal just shows that you are probably creditworthy and serves to give you some credibility with sellers. Once you have an accepted offer and need to find a real mortgage, you can shop around for the best rate and best loan structure. Banks dont need to have pulled your credit to quote rates, but they will need to have a general idea of your FICO range. Once you find the bank you like with the best rate and actually apply for the loan, they will pull a hard bureau, and if your scores are different from what you said before, the rate may change, but within the same range, youll generally be ok. Also, banks do not necessarily pull all 3 bureaus they may only pull 1, as it costs them for each pull. 2 potential downsides to this approach Also, make sure you have a mortgagefunding clause in your contract, as banks are unpredictable, and make sure you have a great real estate lawyer, not a legal \"factory\"  the extra few hundred  are worth it. Dont overthink this credit stuff too much. Find a good house for a good price, and get a nononsense mortgage that you fully understand  no exotic stuff. Good luck!"

For me, the risks are more behavioral than financial Im not saying its a ridiculous, stupid idea, and these are all \"whatif\"s that can be countered with discipline and wise decisions, but having an emergency fund in cash certainly makes all of this simpler and reduces risk. If you have investments that you would have no hesitation liquidating to cover an emergency, then you can make it work. For most people, the choice is either paying cash, or charging it without having investment funds to pay it off, and theyre back in the cycle of paying minimum payments for months and drowning in debt."

    "topic": "Should I participate in a 401k if there is no company match?",
    "content": "With a match, the 401k becomes the priority, up to that match, often ahead of other high interest debt. Without the match, the analysis is more about the cost within the 401k. The 401k is a tax deferred account lets not go on a tangent to Roth 401k so ideally, youd be skimming off money at 25 and saving it till you retire, so some of it is taxed at 0, 10, 15. If the fees in the 401k are say 1.5 between the underlying funds and management fee, it doesnt take long to wipe out the potential 10 or 15 you are trying to gain. Yes, theres a risk that cap gain rates go away, but with todays tax law, the long term rate is 15. So that money put into a long term low cost ETF will have reinvested dividends taxed at 15 and upon sale, a 15 rate on the gains. There are great index ETFs with sub  .1 annual cost. My simple answer is  If the total cost in that 401k is .5 or higher, Id pass. Save the money in an outside account, using IRAs as best you can. The exact situation needs to be looked at very carefully. In personal finance, theres a lot of grey. For example, a frequent job changer can view the 401k as a way of saving pretax, knowing the fee will only last 2 years, and will end with a transfer to the IRA"

The first is the number of shares for your entire order, the second is the amount that will be displayed in the book this is the tip of the iceberg, the remaining shares are hidden below the surface. The makertaker rule applies as follows The amount displayed will receive the rebate for providing liquidity. The amount hidden will be charged the fee for taking liquidity. Example You want to sell 10,000 shares total. You enter a hidden order for 10,000 shares with 1,000 displayed. On the level 2 screen traders will see 1,000 shares, and those shares will stay displayed there until the entire order is filled. You receive a rebate for 1,000 shares, you pay the brokerage fee for 9,000 shares. Also, like one of the previous posters mentioned, only trade high liquidity stocks. Large market cap companies with high volume. This is why day traders love Tesla, Amazon, Netflix, etc. Large market cap, high volume, and high volatility. Easy to catch 10 moves in price.

Robinhood also generates interest off of unused cash deposits from user accounts according to the Federal Funds rate. 2. Second, venture capitalists such as Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Leverage,and many others have invested more than 16 million in the app. 3. According to Barrons, Robinhood plans to implement margin trading in 2015, eventually charging 3.5 interest for the service. ETrade charges 8.44 for accounts under 25,000. Phone assisted trading will also be available at 10 per trade in the future. 4. Originally, Robinhood planned to make money off of order flows  a common tactic used by discount brokerages in the 1990s to generate revenue. According to the companys FAQ, Robinhood backpedaled on the idea because it executes orders through a clearing partner and, as a result, receives little to no payment for order flow. The company is willing to return to its original plan in the future if it receives order flows directly or begins to generate a lot of revenue from them."

    "content": "The short answer zero. dg99s answer gives some good reasons why. You will basically never be able to achieve diversification with individual stocks that is anywhere close to what you can get with mutual funds. Owning individual stocks exposes you to much greater risk in that random oneoff events that happen to affect one of the companies you own can have a disproportionate effect on your assets. For instance, some sort of scandal involving a particular company can cause its stock to tank. There are only two reasons I can see to invest in individual stocks a. You have some unique opportunity to acquire stock that other people might not be able to get or get at that price. This can be the case if you work for a privatelyheld company that allows you to buy stock or options, or allows you to participate in its IPO. Even then, you should not go too crazy, since having too much stock in the company you work for can double your pain if the company falls on hard times you may lose your job and your investment. b. For fun. If you like tracking stocks and trying to beat the market, you may want to test your skills at this by using a small proportion of your investable cash no more than 10. In this case youre not so much hoping to increase your returns as to just enjoy investing more. This can also have a psychological benefit in that it allows you to \"blow off steam\" and indulge your desire to make decisions, while allowing your passive investments index funds to shoulder the load of actually gaining value."

I would say that not having a mortgage has a positive impact on your cash flow and your assets you own the home, which combine to create more opportunity, not less.

Like any insurance, it cant be affordable if it is bought only by those who think they will need it. The premiums you pay, in addition to giving you peace of mind, lower the premiums your neighbours pay. That contributes to social harmony. When your neighbours collect EI while looking for another job, they arent tempted to turn to crime or legalbutnotsavoury ways to earn money. You probably like that, too. The fact they didnt get to choose whether or not to contribute means that they will be covered even if they arent prudent and forwardlooking people, which again is a benefit for you.

    "topic": "Best way to invest money as a 22 year old?",
    "content": "Hopefully this 1000 is just a start, and not the last investment you will ever make. Assuming that, there are a couple of big questions to consider One What are you saving for? Are you thinking that this is for retirement 40 or 50 years from now, or something much sooner, like buying a car or a house? You didnt say where you live. In the U.S., if you put money into an IRA or a 401k or some other account that the government classes as a retirement account, you dont pay taxes on the profits from the investment, only on the original principal. If you leave the money invested for a long period of time, the profits can be many times the original investment, so this makes a huge difference. Like suppose that you pay 15 of your income in state and local taxes. And suppose you invest your 1000 in something that gives a 7 annual return and leave it there for 40 years. Of course Im just making up numbers for an example, but I think these are in a plausible range. And Im ignoring the difference between regular income tax and capital gains tax, etc etc. It doesnt change the point. If you put the money in a classic IRA, you pay 0 taxes the year you open the account, so you have your full 1000, figure that compound interest for 40 years, youll end up with  crunch crunch crunch the numbers  14,974. Then you pay 15 when you take it leaving you with 12,728. The end result with a Roth IRA is exactly the same. Feel free to crunch those numbers. But now suppose you invest in a noretirement account so you have to pay taxes every year. Your original investment is only 850 because you have to pay tax on that, and your effective return is only 5.95 because you have to pay 15 of the 7. So after 40 years you have  crunch crunch  10,093. Quite a difference. But if you put money in a retirement account and then take it out before you retire, you pay substantial penalties. I think its 20. If you plan to take the money out after a year or two, that would really hurt. Two How much risk are you willing to take? The reality of investment is that, almost always, the more risk you take, the bigger the potential returns, and vice versa. Investments that are very safe tend to have very low returns. As youre young, if youre saving for retirement, you can probably afford a fairly high amount of risk. If you lose a lot of money this year, odds are youll get it back over the next few years, or at least be able to put more money into investments to make up for it. If youre 64 and planning to retire next year, you want to take very lowrisk investments. In general, investing in government bonds is very safe but has very low returns. Corporate bonds are less safe but offer higher returns. Stocks are a little more. Of course different companies have different levels of risk new startups tend to be very risky, but can give huge returns. Commodities are much higher risk. Buying on margin or selling short are ways to really leverage your money, but you could end up losing more than you invested. Mutual funds are a relatively safe way to invest in stocks and bonds because they spread your risk over many companies. Three How much effort are you willing to put into managing your investments? How much do you know about the stock market and the commodities market and international finance and so on, and how much are you willing to learn? If your answer is that you know a lot about these things or are willing to dive in and learn a lot, that you can invest in individual stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. If your answer is that you really dont know much about all this, then it makes a lot of sense to just put your money into a mutual fund and let the people who manage the fund do all the work."

Regarding your concerns for the ACH, here is the summarized transaction walkthrough source An Originator whether thats an individual, a corporation or another entity initiates either a Direct Deposit or Direct Payment transaction using the ACH Network. ACH transactions can be either debit or credit payments and commonly include Direct Deposit of payroll, government and Social Security benefits, mortgage and bill payments, online banking payments, persontoperson P2P and businesstobusiness B2B payments, to name a few. Instead of using paper checks, ACH entries are entered and transmitted electronically, making transactions quicker, safer and easier. The Originating Depository Financial institution ODFI enters the ACH entry at the request of the Originator. The ODFI aggregates payments from customers and transmits them in batches at regular, predetermined intervals to an ACH Operator. ACH Operators two central clearing facilities The Federal Reserve or The Clearing House receive batches of ACH entries from the ODFI. The ACH transactions are sorted and made available by the ACH Operator to the Receiving Depository Financial Institution RDFI. The Receivers account is debited or credited by the RDFI, according to the type of ACH entry. Individuals, businesses and other entities can all be Receivers. Each ACH credit transaction settles in one to two business days, and each debit transaction settles in just one business day, as per the Rules. Take heed of this like The Originator initiates a direct depositpayment transaction. In your scenario, the originator would be B. But since the transaction amount is higher than the limit, B would not even initiate the ACH transaction. The request would be denied. So the transaction would look like this [1] Usually this cost comes down to just the processing costs of the denied transaction and it is rather failfast like. For the other parties involved it may have additional costs missed deadlines, penalties for not fulfilling an obligation, fines, etc, but for the bank that is irrelevant."

Although the experience of the early 2000s seemed to convince most people otherwise, houses are not an investment. Historically, it has usually been cheaper to rent, because owning a house has nonpecuniary benefits such as the ability to change things around to exactly the way you like them. Consult a rent vs. buy calculator for your area to see if your area is exceptional. I also would not rely on the mortgage interest deduction for the long term, as it seems increasingly likely the Federal government will do away with it at some point.

Credit cards are a good example, personalbusiness loans are also usually unsecured, and youve pretty much covered it. Majority of loans, especially for large amounts, are usually given for a specific purpose usually purchase of a large asset and are secured."

    "content": "Insurance rates are based on statistics manipulated by experts in actuarial \"science\". Actuaries look at how many times different makes and models get into accidents or are targeted by thieves, and how expensive it is to repair them. Many auto and finance sites will publish lists of the best and worst insurance risks. Family style cars like minivans and family sedans fair well, while sports cars get more expensive insurance. New models will get the risk of similar models until there is statistical data on them. One other take away from this discussion is that inexpensive insurance usually coincides with cheap repair costs, lowering your total cost of operation for your vehicle."

    "content": "To start, I hope you are aware that the properties basis gets stepped up to market value on inheritance. The new basis is the start for the depreciation that must be applied each year after being placed in service as rental units. This is not optional. Upon selling the units, depreciation is recaptured whether its taken each year or not. There is no rule of thumb for such matters. Some owners would simply collect the rent, keep a reserve for expenses or empty units, and pocket the difference. Others would refinance to take cash out and leverage to buy more property. The banker is not your friend, by the way. He is a salesman looking to get his cut. The market has had a good recent run, doubling from its lows. Right now, Im not rushing to prepay my 3.5 mortgage sooner than its due, nor am I looking to pull out 500K to throw into the market. Your proposal may very well work if the market sees a return higher than the mortgage rate. On the flip side Im compelled to ask  if the market drops 40 right after you buy in, will you lose sleep? And a fellow poster littleadv is whispering to me  ask a pro if the tax on a rental mortgage is still deductible when used for other purposes, e.g. a stock purchase unrelated to the properties. Last, there are those who suggest that if you want to keep investing in real estate, leverage is fine as long as the numbers work. From the scenario you described, you plan to leverage into an already pretty high in terms of PE10 and simply magnifying your risk."

That means that their business is structured to entice you to pump more transactions through the system. Either their other costs are lower, or the increased business allows them to make more money off of late fees, and interest. If the card has you earn extra points for buying a type of item or from a type of store home stores improvement in the Spring, they are trying to make sure you use their card for what can be a significant amount of business during a small window of time. Sometimes they cap it by saying 5 cash back at home improvement stores during the spring but only on the first 1500 of purchases. That limits it to 75 maximum. Adding more business for them, makes more money for them. Groceries and gas are a good year round purchase categories. Yes there is some variation depending on the season, and the weather, but overall there is not an annual cliff once the season ends. Gas and groceries account for thousands of dollars a year these are not insignificant categories, for many families are recession proof. If they perceive a value from this type of offer they will change their buying behavior. My local grocery store has a deal with a specific gas station. This means that they made a monetary deal. Because you earn points at the grocery store and spend points at the gas station, the grocery store is paying some compensation to the gas station every time you use points. The gas station must be seeing an increase in business so theoretically they dont get 100 compensation from the grocery store. In cases where credit cards give airline miles, the credit card company buys the miles from the airline at a discount because they know that a significant number of miles will never be used."

In the UK there are some clear rules about banks giving customers a chance to restructure their debts. Thats the BANK doing it, not some shady loanshark.

    "topic": "Are these really bond yields?",

It would be more precise to say that \"a 30Y US Treasury bond yields 2.78 per year annualized over 30 years\", but that terminology is implied in bond markets. So if you invest 1,000 in a 30year Tbond, you will earn roughly 2.78 in interest per year. Also note that yield is calculated as if it compounded, meaning that investing in a 30year Tbind will give you a return that is equivalent to putting it in a savings account that earns 1.39 interest half of 2.78 every 6 months and compounds, meaning you earn interest on top of interest. The tradeoff for these low yields is you have virtually no default risk. Unlike a company that could go bankrupt and not pay back the bond, the US Government is virtually certain to pay off these bonds because it can print or borrow more money to pay off the debts. In addition, bonds in general and especially treasuries have very low market risk, meaning that their value fluctuates much less that equities, even indicies. SP 500 indices may move anywhere between 40 and 50 in any given year, while Tbonds range of movement is much lower, between 10 and 30 historically."

As for SelfEmployment Tax, I suspect that she doesnt have to pay it in either case, because there is a sentence in your linked page for Nonresident Spouse Treated as a Resident that says However, you may still be treated as a nonresident alien for the purpose of withholding Social Security and Medicare tax. and since SelfEmployment Tax is just Social Security and Medicare tax in another form, she shouldnt have to pay it if treated as resident, if she didnt have to pay it as nonresident. From the law, I believe Nonresident Spouse Treated as a Resident is described in IRC 6013g, which says the person is treated as a resident for the purposes of chapters 1 and 24, but selfemployment tax is from chapter 2, so I dont think selfemployment tax is affected by this election."

Every major fund familly also offers at least a few balanced funds which give you a mixture of stocks and bonds, and sometimes some alternatives, in one fund.

Account one ... Roth IRA. Account two a brokerage account for the excess funds that cant be placed in the Roth IRA. Each year it will be easy transfer money into the Roth from this account. Be aware that you cant transfer stocks from brokerage acct to Roth IRA ... only cash. You can sell some stocks in brokerage and turn that into cash to transfer. This means settling up with the IRS on any gainslosses on that sale. Given your situation youd likely have new cash to bring to table for the Roth IRA anyway. Invest in stocks and hold them for the long term. Do a google search for \"motley fool stock advisor\" and join. This is a premium service that picks two stocks to invest in each month.

This is because pension contributions normally attract tax relief at the highest marginal rate  i.e. 40 if the gross salary is above about 40,000, and 50 for salaries above 150,000. But after April 2011, the rate of relief will be tapered down for gross salaries above 150,000, reaching 20 for a gross salary of 180,000. So for example if you earn 175,000 and make a contribution of 50,000, then an additional 1,000 in salary will incur 500 of direct tax, and also lead to a 1 reduction in tax relief from 25 to 24, costing another 500.

A definition I like to use for market cap is \"the current assets, plus the perceived present value of all future earnings for the company\"... so lets dissect that a little. The term \"present value\" is really important, because a million dollars today is worth more than a million dollars next year. A company expected to make a lot of money soon will be worth more i.e. a higher market cap than a company expected to make the same amount of money, but later. The \"all future earnings\" part is exactly what it sounds like. So again, following our cisco example, the current market cap is 142 billion, which means that \"the market\" thinks they will earn about 85 billion over the life of the company in present day dollars."

I dont know if PayPal is required to file 1099s for payments received, but if youve ever received such a document, so has the IRS, and theyll match it to the income you claimed and see a discrepancy, triggering an audit. Depending on the amount that it affects your taxes it can be significant if you have a 50kyr day job, youd owe the government 25 cents on every dollar donated, they can let it slide, they may simply dock your next return, or they may come after you for interest and penalties or even charge you with criminal tax fraud if they could prove you maliciously attempted to conceal this revenue. Now, if you already itemize using a Schedule A, then you can erase this income by deducting the costs of the server, not to exceed the amount of the donations. The best you can do is offset it you cannot use this deduction to reduce taxable income from other sources. Also, you must itemize you cant take your standard deduction, and with a maximum possible deduction of the actual costs of running the server 1500, IF you receive enough donations to fully pay for it compared to one persons standard deduction 5800, youll want to take the standard deduction if you dont have other significant deductions medical expenses, mortgage interestproperty taxes, etc. If you were charging users a monthly fee for use of the server, then youve basically created a de facto sole proprietorship, and you would still have to count the fees as income, but could then deduct the full cost of running the server. Youd fill out a Schedule C listing the revenue and expenses, and back them up with statements from your ISPhosting company and from PayPal. Now, this would apply if you were running the server with the primary goal of making a regular profit Schedule C cannot be used for income from a \"hobby\", undertaken primarily for enjoyment and where a few bucks in revenue is gravy. Whether you think you can get away with that in your current situation is your prerogative I dont think you would, given that the donations are solicited and optional, and thus there is no expectation of ever turning a profit on this game server."

From a pure accounting perspective, if the Open Balance Equity account would zero out, you could just skip it and directly credit the capital accounts, but I prefer the Open Balance Equity as it helps know the percentages of initial equity which may influence partner ownership percentages and identify anyone who needs to contribute more to the partnership."

    "topic": "Why is the number of issued shares less than the number of outstanding shares",
    "content": "I have been asking myself a similar question about the financial statements of Weyerhaeuser. In response to Dheers comment, whilst treasury shares are treated as a negative, it is issued shares less treasury shares the negative which gives the outstanding shares. So the original query remains unanswered. Ive searched several sources and all state that outstanding shares will never be greater than issued shares. Ive realized that the shares referred to are those authorized followed by those issued and outstanding current year and prior year respectively i.e. the shares that are both issued and outstanding as they must be issued in order to be outstanding This is supported in the example of Weyerhaeuser as there was a large increase in shares during Q1 2016 as a result of their merger with Plum Creek. Shares issued and outstanding are 510 million and 759 million respectively."

    "content": "Join me for a look at the Quote for SPY. A yield of 1.82. So over a years time, your 100K investment will give you 1820 in dividends. The Top 10 holdings show that Apple is now 3 of the SP. With a current dividend of 2.3. Every stock in the SP has its own different dividend. Although the zeros are all the same. Not every stock has a dividend. The aggregate gets you to the 1.82 current dividend. Dividends are accumulated and paid out quarterly, regardless of which months the individual stocks pay."

    "content": "the implications are that the companys earnings per share may seem greater, after the company buys them there will be less shares outstanding, giving wall street the impression that there is more growth potential than there really is. its an accounting gimmick that can work for a few quarters while the company evaluates how else to impress wall street"

    "content": "If the cheque is crossed as almost all are these days, it can only be paid into an account in the name of the person it was written out to it cannot be paid into anothers account, nor can it be \"cashed\"1  see the rules on \"Crossed\" cheques. Note that while the recipient of the cheque cannot legally alter this state of afairs, the writer of a cheque that was printed precrossed can  at least technically  cancel the crossing see above link. Probably the best the OP can do is pay in the cheque on the friends behalf as described in Ben Millwoods answer and then either lend the friend some money until they are mobile and can get some cash to repay the OP or have the friend write one of their own cheques which the OP can pay into their bank account. 1 As mentioned in the last section of the rules on crossed cheques, the only exception is that designated \"Cheque cashing shops\" have special arrangements to deposit cheques which they have cashed after deducting a fee. However, they would should? require proof of identity of the original payee and so are unlikely to be of any help and probably not worth the cost for 35. Having said that, Ive never used one, so have no idea how strict they are in practice."
