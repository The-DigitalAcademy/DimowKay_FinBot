Administrator vs Broker vs Custodian for a Solo 401k?,"Their paperwork should help you along. Schwab is the broker and custodian, you are the administrator. Theres virtually no paperwork after the account is opened, until you hit 250K in value, and then theres one extra IRS form you need to fill out each year. See OneParticipant 401k Plans for a good IRS description of form 5500. Disclosure  I use the Schwab Solo 401k myself, and the only downsides, in my opinion, the dont offer a Roth flavor, and no loans are permitted. Both of these features would offer flexibility.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting. The broker executes trades, and the custodian holds your assets. Schwab often acts as both. You only file Form 5500 once assets exceed $250K."
How to read a chart after a split?,"The share price on its own has little relevance without looking at variations. In your case, if the stock went from 2.80 to 0.33, you should care only about the 88 drop in value, not what it means in presplit dollar values. You are correct that you can ""unsplit"" to give you an idea of what would have been the dollar value but that should not give you any more information than the variation of 88 would. As for your title question, you should read the chart as if no split occurred as for most intents and purposes it should not affect stock price other than the obvious split.",How should I interpret a stock chart after a split to evaluate post-split price performance over time?,Read charts post-split as if the split always existed. Focus on percentage movements rather than raw values.
Is investing exlusively in a smallcap index fund a wise investment?,"Stock portfolios have diversifiable risk and undiversifiable risk. The market rewards investors for taking undiversifiable risk e.g. owning an index of oil producing companies and does not reward investors for assuming diversifiable risk e.g. owning a single oil producing company. The market will not provide investors with any extra return for owning a single oil company when they can buy an oil index fund at no additional cost. Similarly, the market will not reward you for owning a smallcap index fund when you can purchase a globally diversified  capitalization diversified index fund at no additional cost. This article provides a more detailed description. The Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund is a much better staring point for an equity portfolio. You will need to make sure that the asset allocation of your overall portfolio e.g. stocks, bonds, P2P lending, cash is consistent with your time horizon 510 years.","Is it advisable to allocate 100% of an equity portfolio to a small-cap index fund over a 10-year period, and what risks does that entail?","While small-cap funds offer growth potential, they come with high volatility. For a 10-year horizon, blend them with global diversification."
"Does the uptick rule apply to all stocksETFs and other securities, or only specific ones?","The uptick rule is gone, but it was weakly reintroduced in 2010, applied to all publicly traded equities Under the terms of the rule, a circuit breaker would be triggered if a stock falls by 10 or more in a single day. At that point, short selling would only be allowed if the price is above the current national best bid, a restriction that would apply for the rest of the day and the whole of the following day. Derivatives are not yet restricted in such ways because of their spontaneous nature, requiring a short to increase supply however, this latest rule widens options spreads during collapses because the exemption for hedging is now gone, and whats more a tool used by options market makers, shorting the underlying to offset positive delta, now has to go to the back of the selling line during a panic. Bonds are not restricted because for one there isnt much interest in shorting because bonds usually dont have enough variance to exceed the cost of borrowing, and many do not trade frequently enough because even the cost to trade bonds is expensive, so arranging a short in its entirety will be expensive. The preferred method to short a bond is with swaps, swaptions, etc.","Which types of securities are subject to the modified uptick rule after a 10% daily drop, and how does it impact short selling?",This rule limits short selling after a 10% intraday drop in stocks or ETFs. It's not applicable to derivatives or bonds.
"If the U.S. defaults on its debt, what will happen to my bank money? ","You must mean the current debt ceiling debacle. The meaning of it is US government is constantly borrowing money by issuing treasury bonds and constantly repaying some of the bonds that come to maturity, and also has other obligations it has to meet by law all the time  such as Social Security checks, bonds interest, federal employees salaries and pensions, etc. By law, total amount of money that can be borrowed at the same time is capped. That means, there can be situation where the government needs to borrow money to pay, say, interest on existing bonds, but can not, since the limit is reached. Such situation is called a default, since the government promised to pay the interest, but is unable to do so. That does not mean the government has no money at all and will completely collapse or couldnt raise money on the market if it were permitted by law to do so currently, the market is completely willing to buy the debt issued by US government, and with interest that is not very high, though of course that may change. It also does not mean the economy ceases to function, dollars cease to have value or banks instantly go bankrupt. But if the government breaks its promises to investors, it has various consequences such as raising the costs of borrowing in the future. Breaking promises to other people  like Social Security recipients  would also look bad and probably hurt many of them. Going back to your bank account, most probably nothing would happen to the money you store there. Even if the bank had invested 100 of the money in US treasury bonds which doesnt really happen they still can be sold on the open market, even if with some discount in the event of credit rating downgrade, so most probably your account would not be affected. As stated in another answer, even if the fallout of all these calamities causes a bank to fail, theres FDIC and if your money is under insured maximums youll be getting your money back. But if your bank is one of the big ones, nothing of the sort would happen anyway  as we have seen in the past years, government would do practically anything to not allow any big bank failures.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."
Co Signed car loan and need to have the other signer relinquish claim to ownership,"Your arrangements with the bank are irrelevant. Whoever is named on the title of the vehicle owns it. If she is the ""primary"", then I assume her name is on the title, therefore she owns the car. If you drive off with the car and it is titled in her name, she can report it stolen and have you arrested for grand theft auto unless you have a dated and signed permission in writing from her to use the car. Point 2 If a car loan was involved, then you didnt ""purchase"" the car, the bank did. If you want to gain ownership of the car, then you need to have her name removed from the title and have yours put in its place. Since the bank has possession of the title, this will require the cooperation of both your girlfriend and the bank.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Co Signed car loan and need to have the other signer relinquish claim to ownership?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

When can you use existing real estate as collateral to buy more?,"You put 20 down and already owe the 80 or 80k, so you dont have the ability to borrow 100k or even 20k for that matter.

Can I contribute to an IRA from investment income?,"Your contributions must come from ""compensation"". Quoting IRS Publication 590 on IRAs, ""Generally, compensation is what you earn from working."" So it is unlikely that your stock sale proceeds, if theyre your sole source of income, can be used to fund your IRA.

"How should I be contributing to my 401k, traditional or Roth?","Im of the opinion that it doesnt matter much unless something in your life changes in retirement. And since many retirement planners assume a default income target of 80 percent of preretirement income, I figure many peoples tax bracket isnt moving much. The most interesting reason I know to Go Roth in a 401k is limits. You can only contribute like 17k, whether Roth or not. In a traditional contribution, some of the 17k you put in goes to taxes when taken out, but in a Roth contribution you pay taxes up front. So if you have more than 17k to invest, Roth lets you sneak some more into the system.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Loan to son  how to get it back,"I started a business a few years ago. At one point it wasnt going so well and my father ""loaned"" me an amount not too dissimilar to what youve done. From a personal perspective, the moment I took that loan there was a strain the relationship. Especially when I was sometimes late on the interest payments... Unfortunately thoughts like ""he doesnt need this right now, but if I dont pay the car loan then that is taken away"" came up a few times and paying the interest fell to the bottom of the monthly bill payment stack. At some point my wife and I finally took a hard look at my finances and goals. We got rid of things that simply werent necessary car payment, cable tv, etc and focused on the things we needed to. Doing the same with the business helped out as well, as it helped focus me to to turn things around. Things are now going great. That said, two of my siblings ran into their own financial trouble that our parents helped them on. When this happened my father called us together and basically forgave everyones debt by an equal amount which covered everything plus wrote a check to the one that was doing fine. This ""cleared the air"" with regards to future inheritance, questions about how much one sibling was being helped vs another, etc. Honestly, it made family gatherings more enjoyable as all that underlying tension was now gone. Ive since helped one of my children. Although I went about it an entirely different way. Rather than loan them money, I gave it to them. We also had a few discussions on how I think they ought to manage their finances and a set of goals to work towards which we codeveloped.

Why do DealersBrokers hold Inventory in Stocks?,"The difficulty is that you are thinking of a day as a natural unit of time. For some securities the inventory decisions are less than a minute, for others, it can be months. You could ask a similar question of ""why would a dealer hold cash?"" They are profit maximizing firms and, subject to a chosen risk level, will accept deals that are sufficiently profitable. Consider a stock that averages 1,000 shares per day, but for which there is an order for 10,000 shares. At a sufficient discount, the dealer would be crazy not to carry the order. You are also assuming all orders are idiosyncratic. Dividend reinvestment plans DRIP trigger planned purchases on a fixed day, usually by averaging them over a period such as 10 days. The dealer slowly accumulates a position leading up to the date whenever it appears a good discount is available and fills the DRIP orders out of their own account. The dealer tries to be careful not to disturb the market leading up to the date and allows the volume request to shift prices upward and then fills them.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do DealersBrokers hold Inventory in Stocks?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What are the marks of poor investment advice?,"1 I think the phrase ""Variable Annuity"" is a glowing red flag. A corollary to that is that any strategy that uses insurance for a purpose e.g. tax avoidance other than protecting against loss rates at least a yellow flag. 2 The other really obvious indicator is a return that is completely out of whack with the level of risk they are saying the investment has. For example, if someone promises a 10 annual return that is ""Completely Safe"" or ""Very low risk"", Run. 3 If it is advertised on tvradio, or all your friends are talking about it at parties. Stay away. Example Investing in Gold Coins or the hot Tech IPO. 4 The whole sales pitch relies on past returns as proof that the investment will do well without any real discussion of other reasons it will continue to to well. Beware the gamblers fallacy. 5 Finally, be very wary of anyone who has some sort of great investment plan that they will teach you if you just pay X or go to their seminar.

Official Bank Check,"The legal department at the Bank left me a message telling me that the bank check was paid  the recipient got the funds. Call up the bank and find out who the recipient was. Generally it can only be cashed by the person whose name is on it  the original business partner to whom it was intended. It is unlikely to be cashed by the attorney, unless he misrepresented the facts to the bank and got the funds. My question is how could he have cashed it without the original bank check? The other possibility is your mom lost this check, went to the bank and requested them to cancel this and reissue a fresh bankers check and give it to the business partner  in which case the check you had was worthless.

Retirement  asset allocation of 30K for 30 year old single guy,"IMHO bonds are not a good investment at this present time, nor generally. Appreciate for a moment that the yield of an investment is DIRECTLY related to the facetrading value. If a thing bondstock trades for 100 and yields 3, it pays 3. In the case of a bond, the bond doesnt pay a  amount, it pays a  amount. Meaning it pays 3. SO, for the yield to rise, what has to happen to the trading price? It has to decrease. As of 201314 bonds are trading at historically LOW yields. The logical implication of this is if a bond pays a fixed  amount, the trading price of the bond has to have increased. So if you buy bonds now, you will see a decrease in its face value over the long term.

Is Amazons offer of a 50 gift card a scam?,"No. Amazon is a reputable company. Many stores have their own credit card. Additionally they have several cards available, through Visa and Discover.

Its the only way they stay in business. I would read the terms and conditions, but as is, it is not a scam. But a free 50 seems to good to be true. Nothing is free.

World Indexes  Variance between representation of a countrys stocks and the countrys proportion of world GDP,"Stock market indexes are generally based on market capitalization, which is not the same as GDP. GDP includes the value of all goods and services produced in a country this includes a large amount of smallscale production which may not be reflected in stock market capitalizations. Thus the ratio between countries GDPs may not be the same as the ratio of their total market capitalization. For instance, US GDP is approximately 3.8 times as much as Japans see here, but US total market cap is about 5.5 as much as Japans see here. The discrepancy can be even more severe when comparing ""developed"" economies like the US to ""developing"" or ""lessdeveloped"" economies in which there is less participation in largescale financial systems like stock markets. For instance, US GDP is roughly 10 times that of Brazil, but US total market cap is roughly 36 times that of Brazil. Switzerland has a total market cap nearly double that of Brazil despite its total GDP being less than half of Brazils. Since the allworld index includes all investable economies, it will include many economies whose share of market cap is disproportionately lower than their share of GDP. In addition, according to the fact sheet you linked to, that index tracks only large and midcap stocks. This will further skew the weighting to developed economies and to the US in particular, since the US has a disproportionate share of the largest companies. Obviously one would need to take a more detailed look at all the weights to determine if these factors account precisely for the level of discrepancy you see in this particular index. But hopefully that explanation gives an idea of why the US might be weighted more heavily in a stock index than it is in raw GDP.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: World Indexes  Variance between representation of a countrys stocks and the countrys proportion of world GDP?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"What exactly is a bad, standard, or good annual raise? If I am told a hard percentage and dont get it, should I look elsewhere?","There are many variables to this answer. One is, how close are you to the average salary range in the industry you are working in. If you are making more than average it would make sense that you are not getting a big raise from the employers perspective. You have to be a top performer if you are looking for the top salary range. Big raises come from promotions or new jobs, generally speaking. The short and personal answer is, I worked at a big company bank and now know that companies do not give large raises to people as a rule. Honestly the only way to make good  is to leave, all employers have all kinds of excuses as to why they are not giving you significant raises. Large raises and bonuses are reserved for ""management"". The bigger the company, the less likely it is that they will give you raises just because, esp. above 35. At the same time, the market sets the rate, and if you are not getting passively recruited, it may mean that you need to work on getting a broader skill set if you are looking to make more  somewhere else. The bottom line is, you have to think of yourself as a free agent at all times. You also need to make yourself more attractive as a potential hire elsewhere.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What exactly is a bad, standard, or good annual raise?

How can a school club collect money using credit cards?,"You should check with the Office of Student Affairs or equivalent at your University to see if you can accept Credit Cards.

If you are set on using credit cards, set up a PayPal account and just use it to reimburse the person who fronts the money cover the markup. Everyone will have to have a PayPal account set up, linked to their credit card. You can avoid fees by using a bank account.

Nasdaq vs Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility,"You can infer some of the answers to your questions from the BATS exchanges market data page and its associated help page. Im pretty sure a page like this exists on each stock exchanges website BATS just happens to be the one Im used to looking at. The Matched Volume section refers to all trades on a given date that took place on ""lit"" exchanges that is, where a public protected US stock exchanges matching engine helped a buyer and a seller find each other. Because there are exactly 11 such exchanges in existence, its easy to show 100 of the matched volume broken down into 11 rows. The FINRA  TRF Volume section refers to all trades on a given date that took place on ""nonlit"" exchanges. These types of trades include dark pool volume and any other trade that is not required to take place in public but is required to be reported the R in TRF to FINRA. There are three venues via which these trades may be reported to FINRA  NASDAQs, NYSEs, and FINRAs own ADF. Theyre all operated under the purview of FINRA, so the fact that theyre ""located at"" NASDAQ or NYSE is a red herring. For example, from the volume data its clear that the NASDAQ facility does not only handle NASDAQlisted Tape C securities, nor does the NYSE facility only handle NYSElisted Tape A securities or anything like that. The number of institutions reporting to each of the TRFs is large  many more than the 11 public exchanges  so the TRF data is not broken down further. Also I think the whole point of the TRFs is to report in secret. I dont know enough details to say why the NASDTRF has always handled more reporting volume than the other two facilities. Of course, since we cant see inside the TRF reporting anyway, its sort of a moot point.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Nasdaq vs Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How expensive is it to keep minimal cash at a brokerage?,"Youre trying to mitigate the risk of having your investments wiped out by fraud committed by your broker by using margin loans to buy stock secured by other, noncash assets in your account.

How to know if I can have NOL U.S. tax?,"Individuals most definitely can have NOL. This is covered in the IRS publication 536. What is the difference between NOL and capital loss? NOL is Net Operating Loss. I.e. a situation where your allowable expenses and deductions exceed your gross income. Basically it means that you have negative income for that year, for tax purposes. Capital loss occurs when the total amount of your capital gains reported on Schedule D is negative. What are their relations then? Not all expenses and deductions that you usually put on your tax return are allowed for NOL calculation. For example, capital loss is not allowed. I.e. if you earned 2000 and you lost in stocks 3000  you do not get a 1K NOL. Capital losses are excluded from NOL calculation and in this scenario you still have nonnegative income for NOL purposes even though it is offset in full by capital loss deduction and your ""taxable income"" line is negative. The 1K that was not allowed  gets carried forward to the next year using the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet in the instructions to Schedule D. You calculate your NOL using form 1045 schedule A. You can use the form 1045 to apply the NOL to prior 2 years, or you can elect to apply it only to future years up to 20 years. In what cases, capital loss can be NOL?

Business day and due date for bills,"You definitely have an argument for getting them to reverse the late fee, especially if it hasnt happened very often. If you are late every month they may be less likely to forgive. As for why this happens, its not actually about business days, but instead its based on when they know that you paid. In general, there are 2 ways for a company to mark a bill as paid Late Fees Some systems automatically assign late fees at the start of the day after the due date if money has not been received. In your case, if your bill was due on the 24th, the late fee was probably assessed at midnight of the 25th, and the payment arrived after that during the day of the 25th. You may have been able to initiate the payment on the companys website at 1159pm on the 24th and not have received a late fee or whatever their cutoff time is. Suggestion as a rule of thumb, for utility bills whose due date and amount can vary slightly from month to month, youre usually better off setting up your payments on the company website to pull from your bank account, instead of setting up your bank account to push the payment to the company. This will ensure that you always get the bill paid on time and for the correct amount. If you still would rather push the payment from your bank account, then consider setting up the payment to arrive about 5 days early, to account for holidays and weekends.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Business day and due date for bills?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"What exactly is a bad, standard, or good annual raise? If I am told a hard percentage and dont get it, should I look elsewhere?","You are not actually entitled to any raise at all, unless you had something contractually legally binding which made that so. Im answering this from the UK, but it has been common practice for people over the last 10 years or so to receive no yearly raise, in some sectors. This is what I would consider a bad raise  if wages are not kept in line with inflation, you are effectively earning less every year. In this regard I would not work for any employer who did not offer an annual raise that was at the very least covering the rate of inflation these rates are easy to find in your country by Googling it. In terms of a standard raise, I would argue there is no such thing. This depends on the industrysector you work in, your employers opinion of your performance note Ive used the word opinion because sometimes you may think the effort you put in is different to what they think  be prepared to give evidence of what youve achieved for them, with things to back it up. A good raise is anything which is way above a standard raise. Since there is no concise definiton of a standard raise, this is also hard to quantify. As others have mentioned do not stay in a role where you are not being given a raise that covers inflation, because it means every year you have less purchasing power, which is akin to your salary going down. Its very easy to justify to an employer youre leaving  and indeed one youre going to  why youre making the move under these conditions.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What exactly is a bad, standard, or good annual raise?

Why does Charles Schwab have a Mandatory Settlement Period after selling stocks?,"TLDR Why cant banks give me my money? We dont have your money. Who has my money? About half a dozen different people all over the world. And we need to coordinate with them and their banks to get you your money. I love how everyone seems to think that the securities industry has super powers. Believe me, even with T3, you wont believe how many trades fail to settle properly. Yes, your trade is pretty simple.

Your sell order will have been pushed onto an algorithmic platform, aggregated with other sell order, and crossed with internal buy orders.

Each bank is looking to square off all the different trades between all their counter parties over a single day. Thousands of transactionsfills may have to be processed just for a single name.

Why is cheque cashing a legitimate business?,"This answer is based on my understanding of the US banking system. We have check cashing businesses here too, which are just like what you describe, except for the spelling  Lets consider what ""cash it for free at the bank"" really means, and why it might not be an option for everyone. One key issue is ""which bank?"" As an example, suppose that I have an account at ABC Bank. I take out my checkbook for that account and write you a check for 500. Terminology In this case, I am the drawer or maker of the check, ABC Bank is the drawee bank, and you, user54609, are the payee. Disclaimer ""You"" here is meant as a generic pronoun and I do not mean to insinuate that anything here actually applies to you personally. There are two common things you might do with the check If you have an account at some bank, say XYZ Bank, you might take the check to XYZ Bank and deposit it in your account. You might be able to do this through an ATM, mobile app, or by mail, instead of in person. XYZ Bank does not have a way to verify with certainty that the check is valid e.g. they dont know what my signature looks like, nor whether I actually have 500 in my account at ABC, so they send it to ABC Bank, which verifies the check and transfers 500 to XYZ. This is usually done through a central clearinghouse, such as the Federal Reserve in the US, and in some cases an image of the check may be sent electronically, instead of the physical check. This process takes some time, so XYZ may not make the 500 available to you right away  there may be a hold period before you can withdraw that 500 from your account. You could take the check to ABC Bank, in person. They will verify on the spot that the check is valid and that you are in fact user54609. If everything looks good, they will hand you 500 in cash perhaps subtracting a fee of a few dollars. Now we can see some possible problems with each of these approaches. For 1 Maybe you dont have a bank account at all. There are many possible reasons You dont have enough money to meet the minimum balance that a bank account would require. You used to have an account, but you overdrew or otherwise misused an account, so the bank closed it. They then entered you in a registry such as ChexSystems which ensures that other banks know about this, and so no other bank will open a new account for you. You immigrated to the country illegally and cannot get the documents drivers license, social security number, etc that a bank normally requires to open an account. You simply dont like the idea of keeping your money in a bank. Maybe you do have an account at XYZ Bank, but its in another town. You need the cash today, so you cant use mail or a mobile app, and thirdparty ATMs usually dont accept deposits. Maybe you need to spend the money today, and XYZ Bank would place a hold. For 2 ABC Bank may not have a branch you can conveniently visit. Maybe the nearest one is a long way away, in another city or across the country. Or maybe ABC is an online bank with no physical branches at all. Maybe its in the same city, but you dont have transportation to get you there. Or maybe its simply less convenient than the checkcashing business on the corner. Maybe it is after usual banking hours, or a weekend, and ABC Bank is closed, but you need cash now. In any of these situations, ""cash it at the bank"" might not be a viable option, and so you might reasonably turn to a check cashing business instead. As you say, you will pay a much higher fee there, but maybe it is worth it to you, or you just dont have any choice. Another possibility, of course, is that you are poorly educated about the banking system, and you dont really understand that 1 and 2 are options, or how to go about them. But theres this storefront on the corner that says ""Check Cashing"", so this seems like a lowstress, uncomplicated way to exchange this piece of paper for money. As such, there certainly are people who legitimately might want to cash a valid check at a checkcashing business. Check cashing business do of course take some risk of fraud, since they cant necessarily verify the check. There are sometimes steps they can take to minimize this risk. Sometimes they can call ABC Bank and check that I have sufficient money in my account. Maybe theyll only accept certain kinds of checks, such as payroll checks from wellknown companies for which you can produce a matching pay stub. And they can demand identification from you perhaps allowing more flexible options than a bank, which helps ensure that you are the payee, and would make you easier to track down if you did commit fraud. But they will probably lose some money this way, so they will have to make their fees high enough to cover those losses.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is cheque cashing a legitimate business?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Invest in say, index funds vs spending all money on home?","The short answer is that it depends on the taxation laws in your country. The long answer is that there are usually tax avoidance mechanisms that you can use which may make it more economically feasible for you to go one way or the other. Consider the following The long term average growth rate of the stock market in Australia is around 7. The average interest on a mortgage is 4.75. Assuming you have money left over from a 20 deposit, you have a few options. You could 1 Put that money into an index fund for the long term, understanding that the market may not move for a decade, or even move downwards 2 Dump that money straight into the mortgage 3 Put that money in an offset account Option 1 will get you over the course of 3040 years around 7 return. If and when that profit is realised it will be taxed at a minimum of half your marginal tax rate probably around 20, netting you around 5.25 Option 2 will effectively earn you 4.75 pa tax free Option 3 will effectively earn you 4.75 pa tax free with the added bonus that the money is ready for you to draw upon on short notice. Of the three options, until you have a good 3 months of living expenses covered, Id go with the offset account every single time. Once you have a few months worth of living expenses covered, I would the adopt a policy of spreading your risk. In Australia, that would mean extra contributions to my Super 401k in the US and possibly purchasing an investment property as well once I had the capital to positively gear it. Of course, you should find out more about the tax laws in your country and do your own maths.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Invest in say, index funds vs spending all money on home?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Get a loan with low interest rate on small business,"I am going to assume your location is the US. From what I am seeing it is unlikely you will get a loan other than some government backed thing. You are a poor risk. At 7kmonth, you have above average household income. The fact that all of your income ""is being washed off somewhere"" is a behavior problem, not a mathematical one. For example, why do you have a car payment? You should purchase a car for cash. Failing that, given reasonable rent 1100, reasonable car payment 400, insurances 300, other expenses 1000, you should clear at least 4000 per month in cash flow. Where is that money going? Here tracking spending and budgeting is your friend. Figure out the leaks in your budget and fix them. By cutting back, and perhaps working a second job or somehow earning more you could have a down payment for a home in as little as 10 months. That is not a very long time. Similarly we can discuss the grocery store. Had you prepared for this moment three years ago you could have bought the store for cash. This would have eliminated a bunch of risk and increase the likelihood of this ventures success. If you had started this one year ago, you could have gone in with a significant down payment. The bank would see this as a good risk if you wanted to borrow the remainder. Instead the bank sees you as a person as a poor risk. You spend every dime you make without much concern for the future or possible negative events by implication of your question. If you cannot handle the cash flows of regular employment well, how can you handle the cash flows of a grocery business? It is far more complex, and there is far less room for error.

Why does it look like my 401k loan default was not paid by my 401k account balance?,"When you leave an employer, 401k loans are immediately due or within 30 days or 60 days. So maybe they are waiting to see if you will pay off your loan. If you wanted to transfer the loan as well, you need to talk to your new 401k plan administrator to find out if this even possible. If they say No and you dont pay off the loan, it will count as a premature distribution from your old 401k plan and possibly be subject to excise tax in addition to income tax.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

What is the purpose of the wash sale rule?,"Note that ""to keep an investor from lowering their tax bill"" is not an explanation. Well, yes it is. In fact it is the only explanation. The rule plainly exists to prevent someone from realizing a loss when their economic situation remains unchanged beforeafter a sale. Now, you might say but I have suffered a loss, even if it is unrealized! But, would you want to pay tax on unrealized gains? The tax system still caters to reducing the tax impact of investments, particularly capital investments. Part and parcel with the system of taxing gains only when realized, is that you can recognize losses only when realized. Are there other ways to artificially reduce taxable income? Yes. But the goal of a good tax system should be to reduce those opportunities. Whether you agree that it is fair for the government to prevent this taxsaving opportunity, when others exist, is another question. But that is why the rule exists.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is the purpose of the wash sale rule?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is inflation?,"Inflation is basically this Over time, prices go up! I will now address the 3 points you have listed. Suppose over a period of 10 years, prices have doubled. Now suppose 10 years ago I earned 100 and bought a nice pair of shoes. Now today because prices have doubled I would have to earn 200 in order to afford the same pair of shoes. Thus if I want to compare my earnings this year to 10 years ago, I will need to adjust for the price of goods going up. That is, I could say that my 100 earnings 10 years ago is the same as having earned 200 today, or alternatively I could say that my earnings of 200 today is equivalent to having earned 100 10 years ago. This is a difficult question because a car is a depreciating asset, which means the real value of the car will go down in value over time. Let us suppose that inflation doesnt exist and the car you bought for 100 today will depreciate to 90 after 1 year a 10 depreciation. But because inflation does exist, and all prices will be 0.5 higher in 1 years time, we can calculate the true selling price of the car 1 in year as follows 0.5 of 90  0.00590  0.45 Therefore the car will be 90  0.45  90.45 in 1 years time. If inflation is low, then the repayments do not get much easier to pay back over time because wages have not risen by as much. Similarly the value of your underlying asset will not increase in value by as much. However as compensation, the interest rates on loans are usually lower when inflation is lower. Therefore generally it is better to get a loan in times of high inflation rather than low inflation, however it really depends on how the much the interest rates are relative to the inflation rate.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is inflation?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Considerations for holding shortterm reserves?,"It is a dangerous policy not to have a balance across the terms of assets. Short term reserves should remain in short term investments because they are most likely needed in the short term. The amount can be shaved according to the probability of their respective needs, but long term asset variance usually exceed the probability of needing to use reserves. For example, replacing one month bonds paying essentially nothing with stocks that should be expected to return 9 will expose oneself to a possible sudden 50 loss. If cash is indeed so abundant that reserves can be doubled, this policy can be expected to be stable however, cash is normally scarce. It is a risky policy to place reserves that have a 20 chance of being 100 liquidated into investments that have a 20 chance of declining by approximately 50 just for a chance of an extra 9 annual return. Financial stability should always be of primary concern with rate of return secondary only after stability has been reasonably assured.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Considerations for holding shortterm reserves?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How can a person protect his savings against a country default?,"These have the potential to become ""endoftheworld"" scenarios, so Ill keep this very clear. If you start to feel that any particular investment may suddenly become worthless then it is wise to liquidate that asset and transfer your wealth somewhere else. If your wealth happens to be invested in cash then transferring that wealth into something else is still valid. Digging a hole in the ground isnt useful and running for the border probably wont be necessary. Consider countries that have suffered actual currency collapse and debt default. Take Zimbabwe, for example. Even as inflation went into the millions of percent, the Zimbabwe stock exchange soared as investors were prepared to spend evermore of their devaluing currency to buy stable stocks in a small number of locally listed companies. Even if the Euro were to suffer a critical fall, European companies would probably be ok. If you didnt panic and dig caches in the back garden over the fall of dotcom, there is no need to panic over the decline of certain currencies. Just diversify your risk and buy noncash or euro assets. Update A few ideas re diversification The problem for Greece isnt really a euro problem it is local. Local property, local companies ... these can be affected by default because noone believes in the entirety of the Greek economy, not just the currency it happens to be using  so diversification really means buying things that are outside Greece.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can a person protect his savings against a country default?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Keeping our current home second property as a rental. Will it interfere with purchasing a third home?,"Theres a couple issues to consider When you sell your primary home, the IRS gives you a 500k exemption married, filing jointly on gain. If you decide not to sell your current house now, and you subsequently fall outside the ownershipuse tests, then you may owe taxes on any gains when you sell the house. Rather than being concerned about your net debt, you should be concerned about your monthly debt payments. Generally speaking, you cannot have debt payments of more than 36 of your monthly income. If you can secure a renter for your current property, then you may be able to reach this ratio for your next third property. Also, only 75 of your expected monthly rental income is considered for calculating your 36 number. This is not an exhaustive list of risks you expose yourself to. The largest risk is if you or your spouse find yourself without income e.g. lost job, accidentinjury, no renter, then you may be hurting to make your monthly debt payments. You will need to be confident that you can pay all your debts. A good rule that I hear is having the ability to pay 6 months worth of debt. This may not necessarily mean having 6 months worth of cash on hand, but access to that money through personal lines of credit, borrowing against assets, selling stocksinvestments, etc. You also want to make sure that your insurance policies fully cover you in the event that a tenant sues you, damages property, etc. You also dont want to face a situation where you are sued because of discrimination.

"Why does the share price tend to fall if a companys profits decrease, yet remain positive?","The companys value which should be reflected in the share price is not how much money it has in the bank, but something along the lines of how much money will it make between now and the end of times adjusted for time value of money and risk. So when you purchase a share of a company that has, say, little money in the bank, but expects to make 1M profit this year, 2M for the following 3 years, and say, nothing after, you are going to pay your fraction of 7M minus some discount because of the risk involved. If now they announce that their profits were only 750k, then people may think that the 2M are more likely to be 1.5M, so the companys value would go to  5M. And with that, the market may perceive the company as more risky, because its profits deviated from what was expected, which in turn may reduce the companys value even further.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why does the share price tend to fall if a companys profits decrease, yet remain positive?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Stock trading models that use fundamental analysis, e.g. PEG ratios?","Maria, there are a few questions I think you must consider when considering this problem. Do fundamental or technical strategies provide meaningful information? Are the signals they produce actionable? In my experience, and many quantitative traders will probably say similar things, technical analysis is unlikely to provide anything meaningful. Of course you may find phenomena when looking back on data and a particular indicator, but this is often after the fact. One cannot actionably trade these observations. On the other hand, it does seem that fundamentals can play a crucial role in the overall typically long run dynamics of stock movement. Here are two examples, Technical suppose we follow stock X and buy every time the price crosses above the 30 day moving average. There is one obvious issue with this strategy  why does this signal have significance? If the method is designed arbitrarily then the answer is that it does not have significance. Moreover, much of the research supports that stocks move close to a geometric brownian motion with jumps. This supports the implication that the system is meaningless  if the probability of up or down is always close to 5050 then why would an average based on the price be predictive? Fundamental Suppose we buy stocks with the best PE ratios defined by some cutoff. This makes sense from a logical perspective and may have some long run merit. However, there is always a chance that an internal blowup or some macro event creates a large loss. A blended approach for sake of balance perhaps we consider fundamentals as a good longterm indication of growth what quants might call drift. We then restrict ourselves to equities in a particular index  say the SP500. We compare the growth of these stocks vs. their PE ratios and possibly do some regression. A natural strategy would be to sell those which have exceeded the expected return given the PE ratio and buy those which have underperformed. Since all equities we are considering are in the same index, they are most likely somewhat correlated especially when traded in baskets. If we sell 10 equities that are deemed ""too high"" and buy 10 which are ""too low"" we will be taking a neutral position and betting on convergence of the spread to the market average growth. We have this constructed a hedged position using a fundamental metric and some helpful statistics. This method can be categorized as a type of index arbitrage and is done roughly in a similar fashion. If you dig through some data yahoo finance is great over the past 5 years on just the SP500 Im sure youll find plenty of signals and perhaps profitable if you calibrate with specific numbers. Sorry for the long and rambling style but I wanted to hit a few key points and show a clever methods of using fundamentals.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Stock trading models that use fundamental analysis, e.g. PEG ratios?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Opening offshore account from UK ,"I think your best bet here would be HSBC. They will provide the required currencies, creditdebit cards, and very easy to use online banking transfers. This includes an online ""Global Account View"" which features all of your accounts on a single screen and allows you to ""drag and drop"" money between accounts. Regarding fees, I suspect you will need to be a ""Premier Account"" holder in order to avoid any fees imposed on transactions such as money transfers and exchanging money between currencies. In my experience HSBC offers extremely good exchange rates when exchanging ""large"" amounts of money  greater than 10,000  GBP 5,000 . Exchanging small amounts will carry a larger spread but still much better than most banks offer. In my experience, exchanging GBP 5000 will have a spread of about 0.50to0.75 percent, while exchanging more than GBP10,000 will have a spread of as little as 0.10to0.20 percent. In order to qualify for a ""Premier Account"", if my memory of HSBC UK serves me correctly, you will need to have at least GBP 50,000 net across all of your HSBC managed accounts, including stockbroking and other investment accounts. In order to open a banking Swiss account, you will need to travel to Switzerland and apply in person. You cannot open a foreign bank account remotely. With a foreign investment account, I believe you can open accounts remotely.

How do I get a Tax Exemption Certificate for export from the US if I am in another country?,"Assuming you are being charged sales tax, it all depends on where you take possession of the shipment.

If the former, if the address is in a state in which your supplier has a physical location they will have to charge sales tax. That said, your freight forwarder should be able to furnish your supplier with a letter stating that the goods have been exported with a copy of the relevant Bill of Lading which will allow your supplier to refund you the taxes a company I was at before would allow refunds up to two years past the date of sale per various tax regulations. Alternatively, you could see if just a letter of intent from your freight forwarder is enough to not charge you in the first place, but thats technically not proof of exportation.

What does HMRC the UK tax agency view as valid expenses for travel?,"Food is almost never a valid expense. Reason for it is simple  if you were not conducting business you would have to eat too. Ad 1. I dont see why travel in that case would not be a valid expense, as the only reason for you to travel there is for business reasons. Ad 2. Unlikely as there is a duality of purpose. So while part of it may be business, you are also getting personal benefit from the visit coffeecakes etc so that generally is a no. Ad 3. No, while you can claim for entertainment of employees to sensible extends, that doesnt work when entertaining clients. Ad 4. If any part of the trip is for leisure then you cannot claim it as business expense, sorry! If there is any duality of use then its not a business expense.

Why do companies award stock as opposed to cash?,"There are a few reasons, dependent on the location of the company. The first, as you mentioned is that it means that the employee is invested in the companies success  in theory this should motivate the employee to work hard in order to increase the value of their holdings. Sometimes these have a vestment period which requires that they hold the stock for a certain amount of time before they are able to sell, and that they continue working at the company for a certain amount of time. The second, is that unlike cash, providing stocks doesnt come out of the companies liquid cash. While it is still an expense and does devalue the shares of other shareholders, it doesnt effect the daily working capital which is important to maintain to ensure business continuity. And the third, and this is for the employee, is tax reasons. In particular for substantial amounts. Of course this is dependent on jurisdiction but you can often achieve lower tax rates on receiving shares vs a cash equivalent sum, as you can draw out the money over time lowering your tax obligation each year, or other methods which arent possible to look into now.

What is the best way to invest in gold as a hedge against inflation without having to hold physical gold?,"Since GLD is priced as 110 oz of gold, Id call it the preferred way to buy if thats your desire. I believe gold is entering classic bubble territory. Caveat emptor. A comment brought me back to this question. My answer still applies, the ETF the best way to buy gold at the lowest transaction cost. The day I posted and expressed my bubble concern, gold was 1746. Today, nearly 5 years later, its 1350, a drop of 23, plus an additional 2 of accumulated expenses. Note, GLD has a .4 annual expense. On the other hand, the SP is up 80 from that time. In other words, 10K invested that day would be worth less than 7,700 had it been invested in gold, and 18,000 in stock.

Repaying Debt and Saving  Difficult Situation,"Your mother has a problem that is typical for a woman with children. She is trying to help her children have a good life, by sacrificing to get them to a point where they can live comfortably on their own. Though she has a difficult situation now, much of the problems come from a very few choices by her and her children, and her situation can be fixed. Let me point out a few of the reasons why she has come to this point My mother is a single mom... she is turning 50 this summer... she has about 60k in school loans from the college I attended... she has payments of 500month 10k to my sisters college... she lives on her own in a 2 bedroom apartment... Mothers current income statement, Income Essentials total 3131, 71, too high, goal 2200 Lifestyle total 150, low, she should have 500900 to live her life Financial total 1350, 31 Some observations and suggestions Even though the 1625 rents seems high, your mom might enjoy her apartment and consider part of her rent 300 a lifestyle choice spending money for time, and the higher rent may make sense. But the rent is high for her income. Your mom should be spending more on food, and budget 200month. Your mom should be saving money for investments and retirement. She should be putting 10 into savings 440, plus any IRA401K pretax savings. Your sister should be paying for her own college. She should take her own student loans, so that her mother can save for retirement. And since she only has 10K left, an alternative would be that you could loan her the money, and she could repay you when she graduates you have money, as you loaned your mother 8K. You should be repaying the 500month on the 60K student loan your mother took to help you get through college. You have benefited from the education, and the increased opportunity the college education has given you. Now is the time to accept responsibility and pay your debts. You could at least agree to split the expense with her, and were you paying even 300month leaving 200 for her, that would still fix her budget. Your mom should get a car that is paid for and reduce her transportation expenses, until the 350month debt is resolved. She should resolve to spend no more than 300month for a car, and with 100month for insurance be under 10 for her vehicle. Since your mother lives in the US NJ she could avoid the 350month debt payment though BK. But since there are other solutions she could exercise to resolve her problems, this is probably not needed. You mom could consider sharing her apartment to share expenses. Paying 1625 for an apartment for one person seems extravagant. She might enjoy sharing her apartment with a roommate. That is about it. Once her children take responsibility for their lives, your mom will have a manageable budget, and less stress in her life. Mothers revised income statement, Income Essentials total 2721, 62, high, need to reduce by 500 Lifestyle total 450, 10, low Financial total 990, 23 While you and your sister have these changes, Summary of changes Some rent is lifestyle, reduced car loan by 200, sister pays her college 500, you pay your college 300, mom saves 10 of her income. Once your sister graduates and starts to repay you for your help with her college, you can take over paying the remainder of your loans, saving your mom an additional 200month.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."

As even these ""Baby Berks"" rose in price to pass US4500 per share, the stock split 50 to 1, and now trade in the US90s. So, the current ratio is 1500 to 1.

Why would people sell a stock below the current price?,"Firstly, if a stock costs 50 this second, the bidask would have to be 4950. If the bidask were 4951, the stock would cost 51 this second. What youre likely referring to is the last trade, not the cost. The last trading price is history and doesnt apply to future transactions. To make it simple, lets define a simple order book. Say there is a bid to buy 100 at 49, 200 at 48, 500 at 47. If you place a market order to sell 100 shares, it should all get filled at 49. If you had placed a market order to sell 200 shares instead, half should get filled at 49 and half at 48. This is, of course, assuming no one else places an order before you get yours submitted. If someone beats you to the 100 share lot, then your order could get filled at lower than what you thought youd get. If your internet connection is slow or there is a lot of latency in the data from the exchange, then things like this could happen. Also, there are many ECNs in addition to the exchanges which may have different order books.

Is 0 credit card utilization worse than 120 credit card utilization for any reason other than pure statistics?,"This question has been absolutely perplexing to me. It has spawned a few heated debates amongst fellow colleagues and friends. My laymen understanding has provided me with what I believe to be a simple answer to the originators question. Im trying to use common sense here so be gentle. FICO scores, while very complex and mysterious, are speculatively calculated from data derived from things like length of credit history, utilization, types of credit, payment history, etc. Only a select few know the actual algorithms closely guarded secrets?. Are these really secrets? I dont know but its the word on the street so Im going with it! Creditors report data to these agencies on certain dates weekly, monthly or annually. These dates may be ascertained by simply calling the respective creditor and asking. Making sure that revolving credit accounts are paid in full during the creditors ""data dump"" may or may not have a positive impact on ones FICO score. A zero balance reported every time on a certain account may appear to be inactive depending on how the algorithm has been written and vice versa utilization and payment history may outweigh the negativity that a constantly zero balance could imply. Oh Lord, did that last sentence just come out of my head? I reread it four times just make sure it makes sense. My personal experience with revolving credit and FICO I was professionally advised to Without any other life changing credit instances just using the credit card in this fashion my FICO score increased by 44 points. I did end up paying a little in interest but it was well worth it. Top tier feels great! In conclusion I would say that the answer to this question is not cut and dry as so many would imply.

What is the minimum age for early retirement,"You can withdraw from CPP as early as 60. However, by doing so, you will permanently reduce the payments. The reduction is calculated based on average life expectancies. If you live for an average amount of time, that means youll receive approximately the same total amount after inflation adjustments whether you start pulling from CPP at 60, 65, or even delay your pension later. People may have pensions through systems other than CPP. This is often true for big business or government work. They may work differently. People who retire at 55 with a pension are not getting their pension through CPP. A person retiring at 55 would need to wait at least five years to draw from the CPP, and ten years before he or she was eligible for a full pension through CPP. Canada also offers Old Age Security OAS. This is only available once you are 65 years old or older, though this is changing. Starting in 2023, this will gradually change to 67 years or older.

"File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options?","If your parents can afford to shell out 1,250 a month for 5 years, they would pretty much have the debt paid off, provided the credit card companies dont start playing games with rates. If that payment is too high, maybe you could kick in 5k every few months to knock the principal down. If they think the business can keep puttering along without losing more money, that may be the way to go. Five years is long enough that the business or property may have recovered some value. Another option, depending on the value of the home, could be a reverse mortgage. I dont know how the economy has affected those programs, but that might be a good option to get the debt cleared away. My grandfather was in a similar position back in the 70s. He owned taverns in NYC that catered to an industrial clientele... the place was booming in the 60s and my grandfather and his brother owned 4 locations at one point. But the death of his brother, postVietnam malaise, suburban exodus and shutting of industry really hurt the business, and he ended up selling out his last tavern in 1979  which was a dark hour in NYC history and real estate values. A few years later, that building sold for a tremendous amount of money... I believe 10x more. I dont know whether there was a way for his business to survive for another 57 years, as I was too young to remember. But I do remember my grandfather and my father to this day being melancholy about the whole affair. Its hard to have to work parttime in your 60s and be constantly reminded that your family business  and to some degree a part of your life  ended in failure.

Does selling mixedterm stocks with a LIFO tax strategy make sense?,"Your question is missing too much to be answered directly. Instead  here are some points to consider. Short term gains taxed at your marginal rates, whereas long term gains have preferable capital gains rates up to 20 tax rate, instead of your marginal rate. So if youre selling at gain, you might want to consider to sell FIFO and pay lower capital gains tax rate instead of the short term marginal rate. If youre selling at loss and have other short term gains, you would probably be better selling LIFO, so that the loss could offset other short term gains that you might have. If youre selling at loss and dont have short term gains to offset, you can still offset your long term gains with short term losses, but the tax benefit will be lower. In this case  FIFO might be a better choice again. If youre selling at loss, beware of the wash sale rules, as you might not be able to deduct the loss if you buysell within too short a window.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Does selling mixedterm stocks with a LIFO tax strategy make sense?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How secure is my 403b? Can its assets be raided?,"The simple answer is that with the defined contribution plan 401k, 403b, 457 and the US government TSP the employer doesnt hold on to the funds. When they take your money from your paycheck there is a period of a few days or at the most a few weeks before they must turn the money over to the trustee running the program. If they are matching your contributions they must do the same with those funds. The risk is in that window of time between payday and deposit day. If the business folds, or enters bankruptcy protection, or decides to slash what they will contribute to the match in the future anything already sent to the trustee is out of their clutches. In the other hand a defined a benefit plan or pension plan where you get X percent of your highest salary times the number of years you worked is not protected from the company. These plans work by the company putting aide money each year based on a formula. The formula is complex because they know from history some employees never stick around long enough to get the pension. The money in a pension is invested outside the company but it is not out of the control of the company. Generally with a well run company they invest wisely but safely because if the value goes up due to interest or a rising stock market, the next year their required contribution is smaller. The formula also expects that they will not go out of business. The problems occur when they dont have the money to afford to make the contribution. Even governments have looked for relief in this area by skipping a deposit or delaying a deposit. There is some good news in this area because a pension program has to pay an annual insurance premium to The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation a quaigovernment agency of the federal government. If the business folds the PBGC steps in to protect the rights of the employees. They dont get all they were promised, but they do get a lot of it. None of those pension issues relate to the 401K like program.

Is there a good rule of thumb for how much I should have set aside as emergency cash?,"We aim to keep 6 months of expenses. The rationale is that its enough time to recover from most serious illnesses that you can recover from or a redundancy or pay for a large unexpected problem not covered by the insurance e.g. the boiler dying. It also gives us enough time to reorganise finances if needed. For example we could get out of contracts like mobile phones, sky TV, sell the car, and maybe even find a cheaper house if needed in that time. It will take a good chunk of time to build up that amount and its worth considering how many commitments you have kids, wife, mortgage, car... as the fewer you have the less you need. If you have fewer commitments you can be comfortable with much less contingency.

"Why does the share price tend to fall if a companys profits decrease, yet remain positive?","It has got to do with market perceptions and expectation and the perceived future prospects of the company. Usually the expectation of a companys results are already priced into the share price, so if the results deviate from these expectations, the share price can move up or down respectfully. For example, many times a companys share price may be beaten down for increasing profits by 20 above the previous year when the expectation was that it would increase profits by 30. Other times a companys share price may rise sharply for making a 20 loss when the expectation was that it would make a 30 loss. Then there is also a companys prospects for future growth and performance. A company may be heading into trouble, so even though they made a 100M profit this year, the outlook for the company may be bleak. This could cause the share price to drop accordingly. Conversely, a company may have made a loss of 100M but its is turning a corner after reducing costs and restructuring. This can be seen as a positive for the future causing the share price to rise. Also, a company making 100M in profits would not put that all into the bank. It may pay dividends with some, it may put some more towards growing the business, and it might keep some cash available in case cashflows fluctuate during the year.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why does the share price tend to fall if a companys profits decrease, yet remain positive?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why are big companies like Apple or Google not included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA index?,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is a Priceweighted index. That means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant, the ""Dow divisor"". The value of the Dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the roster. This has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price. That is, if a stock costing 100 per share goes up by 1, that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing 10 per share goes up by the same 1. Now look at the price of Google. Its currently trading at just a whisker under 700 per share. Most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between 30 and 150, so if Google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index. That means that relatively small blips in Googles price would completely dominate the index on any given day. Until June of 2014, Apple was in the same boat, with its stock trading at about 700 per share. At that time, Apple split its stock 71, and after that its stock price was a little under 100 per share. So, postsplit Apple might be a candidate to be included in the Dow the next time they change up the components of the index. Since the Dow is fixed at 30 stocks, and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors, this probably wouldnt happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason. Correction Apple is in the DJIA and has been for a little over a year now. Mea culpa. The Dows priceweighting is unusual as stock indices go. Most indices are weighted by market capitalization. That means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value. This causes large companies like Apple to have a lot of influence on those indices, but since market capitalization isnt as arbitrary as stock price, most people see that as ok. Also, notice that I said ""company"" and not ""stock"". When a company has multiple classes of share as Google does, marketcapweighted indices include all of the share classes, while the Dow has no provision for such situations, which is another, albeit less important, reason why Google isnt in the Dow. Keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the SP 500. The answer is currently 505! Finally, you might be wondering why the Dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations. The answer is that the Dow averages go back to 1896, when Charles Dow used to calculate the averages by hand. If your only tools are a pencil and paper, then a priceweighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a marketcapweighted index with hundreds of constituents.

How To Report Cryptocurrency Earnings?,"As cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets, there hasnt been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation, but in 2014 the IRS announced that it published guidance in Notice 201421. Im not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that, though it wouldnt surprise me if treatments changed over time. In that notice, the answer to the first question describes the general treatment For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. Your specific questions about what constitutes a ""business"", and when youre considered to be ""selling"" the cryptoproperty are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the IRS. As the amounts involved here are so small relatively speaking, my recommendation would be to read through what the IRS has published carefully, make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what youre doing, and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations. And when in doubt, erring on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them. Of course, Im not a lawyer or tax advisor, Im a stranger on the Internet, so for ""real"" advice you should contact somebody qualified. I doubt youd be faulted too much for not doing so given the amounts involved. You could also attempt contacting a local IRS office or calling them with your specific questions, and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you, though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later.

Is a total stock market index fund diverse enough alone?,"Youre missing the concept of systemic risk, which is the risk of the entire market or an entire asset class. Diversification is about achieving a balance between risk and return thats appropriate for you. Your investment in Vanguards fund, although diversified between many public companies, is still restricted to one asset class in one country. Yes, you lower your risk by investing in all of these companies, but you dont erase it entirely. Clearly, there is still risk, despite your diversification. You may decide that you want other investments or a different asset allocation that reduce the overall risk of your portfolio. Over the long run, you may earn a high level of return, but never forget that there is still risk involved. bonds seem pretty worthless, at least until I retire According to your profile, youre about my age. Our cohort will probably begin retiring sometime around 2050 or later, and no one knows what the bond market will look like over the next 40 years. We may have forecasts for the next few years, but not for almost four decades. Writing off an entire asset class for almost four decades doesnt seem like a good idea. Also, bonds are like equity, and all other asset classes, in that there are different levels of risk within the asset class too. When calculating the overall riskreturn profile of my portfolio, I certainly dont consider Treasuries as the same risk level as corporate bonds or highyield or junk bonds from abroad. Depending on your risk preferences, you may find that an asset allocation that includes US andor international bondsfixedincome, international equities, realestate, and cash to make rebalancing your asset allocation easier reduces your risk to levels youre willing to tolerate, while still allowing you to achieve returns during periods where one asset class, e.g. equities, is losing value or performing below your expectations.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is a total stock market index fund diverse enough alone?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

That way, if the original Put is successful, at max B is lost, and if it is unsuccessful, the loss on A is covered by a gain on B.

Why charge gross receipts taxes to the customer?,"It sounds like ""gross receipt tax"" is essentially the same thing most states call ""sales tax"", which is always handled this way  prices displayed are pretax, tax is added when the final price is calculated. One reason for doing it that way is that most prices result in taxes that involve fractions of pennies, and calculating from the total produces a more accurate result than calculating tax on each item individually. It is theoretically possible to set prices so the numbers come out evenly when tax is added. But that requires that the prices be in fractional cents, potentially to many decimal places. And in fact in some places it is illegal to display only the withtax price. Otherwise Im sure some stores and restaurants would be willing to deal with the mils and micros, purely on principle or as a marketing gimmick.

Is buying a home a good idea?,"It certainly seems like you are focusing on the emotional factors. Thats your blind spot, and its the surest path to a situation where your husband gets to say ""I told you so"". I recommend you steer straight into that blind spot, and focus your studies on the business aspects of buying and owning homes. You should be able to do spreadsheets 6 ways from Sunday, be able to recite every tax deduction youll get as a homeowner, know the resale impacts of 1 bathroom vs 2, tell a dirty house from a broken house, etc. Everybodys got their favorites, mine are a bit dated but I like Robert Irwin and Robert Allens books. For instance a philosophy of Allens that I really like never sell. This avoids several problems, like the considerable costs of money, time and nerves of actually selling a house, stress about house prices, mistaking your houses equity for an ATM machine, and byzantine rules for capital gains tax mainly if you rent out the house, which vary dramatically by nation. In fact the whole area of taxes needs careful study. Theres another side to the business of home ownership, and thats renting to others. Theres a whole set of economics there  and that is a factor in what you buy. Now AirBNB adds a new wrinkle because theres some real money there.

"Can anybody explain the terms levered beta riders, equity longshort and the quant process driven discipline for me, please?","Leverage here is referring to ""financial leverage"". This is the practice of ""levering"" [ie increasing, like the use of a lever to increase the amount of weight you can lift] the value of your investment by taking on debt. For example if you have 100k in cash, you can buy a 100k rental property. Assume the property makes 10k a year, net of expenses [10]. Now assume the bank will also give you a 100k mortgage, at 3. You could take the mortgage, plus your cash, and buy a 200k rental property. This would earn you 20k from the rental property, less 3k a year in interest costs [the 3]. Your total income would be 17k, and since you only used 100k of your own money, your rate of return would now be 17 instead of 10. This is financial leveraging. Note that this increases your risk, because if your investment fails not only have you lost your own money, you now need to pay back the bank. ""Beta riders"" appears to be negative commentary on investors who use Beta to calculate the value of a particular stock, without regard to other quantitative factors. Therefore ""leveraged beta riders"" are those who take on additional risk [by taking on debt to invest], and invest in a manner that the author would perhaps considered ""blindly"" following Beta. However, I have never seen this term before, and it appears tainted by the authors views on Quants. A ""quant process driven discipline"" appears to be positive commentary on investors who use detailed quantitative analysis to develop rules which they rigorously follow to invest.

How does Portfolio Turnover affect my investment?,"may result in more taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account.

What does Capital Surplus mean?,"I think its easiest to illustrate it with an example... if youve already read any of the definitions out there, then you know what it means, but just dont understand what it means. So, we have an ice cream shop. We started it as partners, and now you and I each own 50 of the company. Its doing so well that we decide to take it public. That means that we will be giving up some of our ownership in return for a chance to own a smaller portion of a bigger thing. With the money that we raise from selling stocks, were going to open up two more stores. So, without getting into too much of the nitty gritty accounting that would turn this into a valuation question, lets say we are going to put 30 of the company up for sale with these stocks, leaving you and me with 35 each. We file with the SEC saying were splitting up the company ownership with 100,000 shares, and so you and I each have 35,000 shares and we sell 30,000 to investors. Then, and this depends on the state in the US where youre registering your publicly traded corporation, those shares must be assigned a par value that a shareholder can redeem the shares at. Many corporations will use 1 or 10 cents or something nominal. And we go and find investors who will actually pay us 5 per share for our ice cream shop business. We receive 150,000 in new capital. But when we record that in our accounting, 5 in total capital per share was contributed by investors to the business and is recorded as shareholders equity. 1 per share totalling 30,000 goes towards actual shares outstanding, and 4 per share totalling 120,000 goes towards capital surplus. These amounts will not change unless we issue new stocks. The share prices on the open market can fluctuate, but we rarely would adjust these. Edit I couldnt see the table before. DumbCoder has already pointed out the equation Capital Surplus  [Stock Par Value  Premium Per Share]  Number of Shares Based on my example, its easy to deduce what happened in the case youve given in the table. In 2009 your company XYZ had outstanding Common Stock issued for 4,652. Thats probably a in thousands, and b at a par value of 1 per share. On those assumptions we can say that the company has 4,652,000 shares outstanding for Year End 2009. Then, if we guess thats the outstanding shares, we can also calculate the implicit average premium per share 90,946,000  4,652,000  19.52. Note that this is the average premium per share, because we dont know when the different stocks were issued at, and it may be that the premiums that investors paid were different. Frankly, we dont care. So clearly since ""Common Stock"" in 2010 is up to 9,303 it means that the company released more stock. Someone else can chime in on whether that means it was specifically a stock split or some other mechanism... it doesnt matter. For understanding this you just need to know that the company put more stock into the marketplace... 9,303  4,652  4,651,000 more shares to be exact. With the mechanics of rounding to the thousands, I would guess this was a stock split. Now. What you can also see is that the Capital Surplus also increased. 232,801  90,946  141,855. The 4,651,000 shares were issued into the market at an average premium of 141,855  4,651  30.50. So investors probably paid or were given by the company an average of 31.50 at this split. Then, in 2011 the company had another small adjustment to its shares outstanding. The Common Stock went up. And there was a corresponding increase in its Capital Surplus. Without details around the actual stock volumes, its hard to get more exact. Youre also only giving us a portion of the Balance Sheet for your company, so its hard to go into too much more detail.

How does a limit order work for a credit spread?,"As you probably know, a credit spread involves buying a call or put at one strike and selling another call or put at another with the same maturity, so youre dealing with two orders. Your broker will likely have to fill this order themselves, meaning that theyll have to look at the existing bidasks for the different strikes and wait until the difference matches or exceeds your limit order. Obviously they cant place limit orders on the legs individually since they cant guarantee that they will both be executed. They also dont care what the individual prices are they just care what the difference is. Its possible that they have computer systems that examine existing bids and asks that would fill your order, but its still done by the broker, not the exchange.

Without them, a great many more Americans would die in poverty. What is the actual figure? The 5000 figure is accurate but irrelevant that median includes people who are thirty years from retirement and people who are two days from retirement. The more relevant statistics are those restricted to people at or close to retirement age, and they can be found lower down in the article you cite, or in numerous other studies. Heres one from the GAO for example httpwww.gao.govproductsGAO15419 The figures here are, unfortunately, no less terrifying Now 104K is a lot better than 5K, but its still not much to retire on. Why we believe that it is reasonable to throw out all the zeros before taking the median, I do not know. That seems like bad math to me. UPDATE There is some discussion of this point in the comments all Im saying here is that this is a clumsy and possibly misleading way to characterize the situation. The linked report has the actual data, but lets try to summarize it here in a more meaningful way. Lets suppose that we make buckets for how dependent on SS is a retirementage household to avoid starving to death, being homeless, and so on? Maybe these buckets are not ideal, and we could move them around a bit. The takeaways here are that the ratios of nothinginadequatebarely adequatecomfortable is about 40302010. That only the top decile of retirementage households can fund a comfortable retirement without help illustrates just how dependent on SS American households are. how do 50 of old Americans survive in their old age? Social Security and Medicare. As the cited GAO report indicates ""Social Security provides most of the income for about half of households age 65 and older."" Do most old Americans rely on their children for financial support? One day I met a woman at a party and we were making small talk about her kids. She had a couple already and one more was on the way. ""I want to have lots of children to support me in my old age"", she said. ""Do you support your parents?"" I asked, which frankly seemed like an entirely reasonable question. ""Of course not! I cant afford it. Ive got a baby on the way and two more kids at home!""

Shorting versus selling to hedge risk,"The point of shortselling as a separate instrument is that you can you do it when you cant sell the underlying asset... usually because you dont actually own any of it and in fact believe that it will go down. Shorting allows you to profit from a falling price. Another nonspeculative possibility is that you dont have the underlying asset right now and thus cant sell it but will get it at a certain point in the future, e.g. because its bonds that youve used to guarantee a loan... or grain thats still growing on your fields.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Shorting versus selling to hedge risk?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

However, you dont pay payroll tax Social Security  Medicare on the withdrawals. You pay no tax until you withdraw. When you invest 18,000 in a Roth 401k, you pay income tax on the 18,000 in the year its invested, but you pay nothing after that. When you invest 18,000 in a taxable investment account, you pay income tax on that 18,000 in the year its invested, you pay tax on dividends even if theyre reinvested, and then you pay capital gains tax when you withdraw.

Should I buy a home or rent in my situation?,"You said 2 things that made me think you are one of the rare young couples barely making it but should attempt to buy rather than rent anyway.... Around my area, renting a place is about equivalent to just paying a monthly mortgage of a 30yr 3.5 APR of a home priced at around 250,500. and... Our ideal price range would be 100,000160,000 with a 2530yr mortgage at 3.5  5.4 The other answers suggesting that you should rent and the reasons given were excellent ones but because of those 2 points you made, this tells me that you would be willing to live in a much much more basic house if you owned rather than rented. Many renters rent rather than buy because they want a really nice place for their money and are willing to spend what it takes to get a nice place, but not you. If you buy, you would be willing to take a place worth half or even less than half what you would get if you rented. That tells me you might accept a place that needs a little work. Perhaps you andor your fiance have some skills needed to do a little of the work yourself. I hope you decide to buy rather than rent if you can swing it, and instead of taking a 2nd job, spend all your spare time working on your little investment. Its possible that by the time youre done fixing that house up some, through your own creative efforts or through the help you might get from your friends, you could end up with a 250,000 house, own it, and reap all the great benefits of owning rather than renting...or...better yet, sell that place for a nice profit, then turn around and buy the next one already fixed up with your newly acquired great credit to help you with the new mortgage, and ready for you to move in and enjoy. Its how my wife and I got started only we didnt have the benefit of historically low interest rates and if we can do it, I believe you can too. Here are a couple tips that might help out....1 Dont spend a lot of money to fix the place...try to find the time to do the simpler tasks yourself. If you dont have the skills, you can learn them on youtube or by picking the brains of all the great willing people working at your local discount home project superstore. 2 Cosmetics go a long way towards increasing the value of a house. a needs paint and b needs carpet but not a major structural damage and b needs roof. Regarding some of your other points... HOA, hopefully if you buy in a formal community, the HOA should be less than 200. If its more than that, it might be harder to do as I suggest. Closing Costs, probably more like 4  5 Taxes, monthly if included in mortgage, normally quarterly or semiannually if not Utilities...youre budgeting quite high for that. Depending on your area, you might only spend an average of 200month, maybe even less. Insurance...see answer for taxes Regular maintenance, 1K a year might be about right but we better include irregular also, which comes up more often than you might think when owning, lets say 2  3 a year.

How does order matching happen in stock exchanges?,"To answer your question in its entirety theres more information we need exchange, session, traded security, order type, etc.. Most exchanges support partial fills, that is your order will be partially executed and modified. In your example, youd get an execution of 10 shares at 100, and your order ticket will be modified to 100 for 990 shares. Like John Bensin explained, there are ways to prevent partial filling through order modifiers e.g. FillorKill. My addition here is, there are also ways to prevent the other bit, i.e. do the partial fill but dont keep a modified order in the system. Youd have to mark the order ImmediateorCancel IoC. In your case youd be partially filled 10 100 and thats it.

The percentage of losing accounts climbed from 67 percent in the first and second quarters to 68 percent in the third quarter and 70 percent in the fourth quarter. Side note The Swiss National Bank abandoned the cap on the currencys value against the euro in midJanuary 2015. But above paragraph provides data on FXCMs retail clients in 2014. It could consequently be concluded that, even without ""freak events"" such as Switzerland removing the franc cap, it is more likely for an investor to NOT make a profit on the FOREX market.

How do annual risks translate into longterm risks?,"The short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years. For independent, identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally. So for any number of monthly returns T, setting the annualization factor m  12 annualises the volatility. It should be the same for all time scales. However, note the discussion here httpsquant.stackexchange.coma74967178 Scaling volatility [like this] only is mathematically correct when the underlying price model is driven by Geometric Brownian motion which implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are normally distributed. Particularly the comment ""its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such ""longterm"" volatility."" Now, a demonstration. I have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean  3 and standard deviation  2, so the annualised volatility should be Sqrt12  2  6.9282. Calculating annualised volatility for return sequences of various lengths 3, 6, 12, 60 months etc. reveals an inaccuracy for shorter sequences. The fiveyear sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure 6.9282, and, as the commenter noted ""volatility is [slightly] overestimated when scaled over long periods of time"". Annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths Edit re. comment Reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much. For instance, comparing some data I have handy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns CR versus Net Returns NR. The return differences are somewhat smoothed, 0.1 each month, 0.25 every third month. More erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How do annual risks translate into longterm risks?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

18 year old making 60k a year how should I invest? Traditional or Roth IRA?,"In asnwer to your questions As joetaxpayer said, you really should look into a Solo 401k. In 2017, this allows you to contribute up to 18kyear and your employer the LLC to contribute more, up to 54kyear total subject to IRS rules. 401k usually have ROTH and traditional sides, just like IRA. I believe the employercontributed funds also see less tax burden for both you and your LLC that if that same money had become salary payroll taxes, etc.. You might start at irs.govretirementplansoneparticipant401kplans and go from there. ROTH vs. pretax You can mix and match within years and between years. Figure out what income you want to have when you retire. Any year you expect to pay lower taxes low income, kids, deductions, etc., make ROTH contributions. Any year you expect high taxes bonus, high wage, taxable capital gains, etc., make pretax payments. I have had a uniformly bad experience with target date funds across multiple 401k plans from multiple plan adminstrators. They just dont perform well a common problem with almost any actively managed fund. You probably dont want to deal with individual stocks in your retirement accounts, so rather pick passively managed index funds that track various markets segments you care about and just sit on them. For example, your highrisk money might be in fastgrowing but volatile industries e.g. tech, aerospace, medical, your mediumrisk money might go in ""total market"" or SP 500 index funds, and your lowrisk money might go in treasury notes and bonds. The breakdown is up to you, but as an 18 year old you have a 50 year horizon and so can afford to wait out anything short of another Great Depression and maybe even that.

Ballpark salary equivalent today of healthcare benefits in the US?,"Many answers here have given what look to be useful perspectives on your question. I want to point out an interesting technical issue. If an employer contracts with an insurer, it agrees to cover all employees or all that fill some prespecified definition and no one else, and to offer only a limited range of options. If you buy insurance directly, you obviously have a huge range of choices, including the technically illegal one of no insurance at all. Your first thought is probably, ""Hey, thats great! More options, more chances to pick the plan thats right for me."" Sorry, no. Yes, you have more options, but so does everyone else. If you are working for some large company, you get insurance, period. If you suspect you have an expensive health condition, you cannot buy more insurance if you believe yourself to be healthy as a horse, you cannot get skimpier insurance and pocket the difference. Healthy people and sick people are all in the same predictable pool. If you buy insurance freely, the insurer knows that the sicker you are, the more likely you are buy insurance, a phenomenon called adverse selection. As a result, the premiums fees a person buying his own insurance pays are much higher, because most of his fellow policyholders are sickly  even if he himself is just riskaverse. On the other hand, if you are riskneutral, if you can survive a 10,000 bill if it happens to arise, you can save big by finding the skimpiest imaginable insurance, where all your fellow policyholders will be hale and healthy people like yourself.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Ballpark salary equivalent today of healthcare benefits in the US?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

It really says nothing anyone would not already know. Everyone knows that your total return equals the sum of the income return plus capital gains.

So he used the dividend growth rate as a proxy for the earnings growth rate or capital gains rate. You cannot use inflationremoved estimates of equity rates of return because those returns do not change with inflation. If anything they move in opposite directions.

Now, you say you want to take the 750 and pay down the card. If you wait a year at 20 youll owe 900, but have access to borrow a full 1000, at a low rate, 4 or so. The payment is less than 19mo for 5 years. So long as one is comfortable juggling their debt a bit, the impact of a fully matched 401k cannot be beat. Keep in mind, this is a different story than those who just say ""dont take a 401k loan."" Here, its the loan that offers you the chance to fund the account. If you are let go, and withdraw the money, even at the 25 rate, you net 1500 less the 200 penalty, or 1300 compared to the 750 you are out of pocket. If you dont want to take the loan, youre still ahead so long as you are able to pay the cards over a reasonable time. Ill admit, a 20 card paid over 10 years can still trash a 100 return. This is why I add the 401k loan to the mix. The question for you  jldugger  is how tight is the budget? And how much is the match?

Can a car company refuse to give me a copy of my contract or balance details?,"No, they cannot refuse to provide you with the current balance or a balance history. The other answers point you to resources that are available to help you put pressure on the dealership.

You should now use that information and demand a better response in writing. If they have to give you a response in writing, they cant deny the answer they gave in a court of law later on.

Buying shares in employers company during IPO,"Rather than take anyones word for it including and especially mine you need to do think very carefully about your company you know it far better than almost anyone else. Do you feel that the company values its employees? If it values you and your immediate colleagues then its likely that it not only values its other employees but also its customers which is a sign that it will do well. Does the company have a good relationship with its customers? Since you are a software engineer using a web stack I assume that it is either a web consultancy or has an ecommerce side to it so you will have some exposure to what the customers complain about, either in terms of bugs or UX difficulties. You probably even get bug reports that tell you what customer pain points are. Are customers concerns valid, serious and damaging? If they are then you should think twice about taking up the offer, if not then you may well be fine. Also bear in mind how much profit is made on each item of product and how many you can possibly sell  you need to be able to sell items that have been produced. Those factors indicate how the future of the company looks currently, next you need to think about why the IPO is needed. IPOs and other share offerings are generally done to raise capital for the firm so is your company raising money to invest for the future or to cover losses and cashflow shortfalls? Are you being paid on time and without issues? Do you get all of the equipment and hiring positions that you want or is money always a limiting factor? As an insider you have a better chance to analyse these things than outsiders as they effect your daytoday work. Remember that anything in the prospectus is just marketing spiel expecting a 4.5  5.3 div yield is not the same as actually paying it or guaranteeing it. Do you think that they could afford to pay it? The company is trying to sell these shares for the maximum price they can get, dont fall for the hyped up sales pitch. If you feel that all of these factors are positive then you should buy as much as you can, hopefully far more than the minimum, as it seems like the company is a strong, growing concern. If you have any concerns from thinking about these factors then you probably shouldnt buy any unless you are getting a discount but thats a different set of considerations as your money would be better utilized elsewhere.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Buying shares in employers company during IPO?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Evidence for timing market in the short run?,"The study of technical analysis is generally used sometimes successfully to time the markets. There are many aspects to technical analysis, but the simplest form is to look for uptrends and downtrends in the charts. Generally higher highs and higher lows is considered an uptrend. And lower lows and lower highs is considered a downtrend. A trend follower would go with the trend, for example see a dip to the trendline and buy on the rebound. Whilst a bottom fisher would wait until a break in the downtrend line and buy after confirmation of a higher high as this could be the start of a new uptrend.

Why are interest rates on saving accounts so low in USA and Europe?,"Banks in general will keep saving rates as low as possible especially if there is a surplus of funds or alternative access for funding as in the case of the Fed in the USA. Generally speaking, why would bank pay you a high interest rate when they cannot generate any income from your money? Usually we will expect to see a drop in the loan interest rate when their is a surplus of funds so as to encourage investment. But if the market is volatile then no banks will allow easy access to money through loans. The old traditional policy of lending money without proper security and no control from the central bank has created serious problems for savings account holders when some of these banks went into bankruptcy. It is for this reason most countries has modified their Financial Act to offer more protection to account holders. At the moment banks must follow rigid guidelines before a loan can be approved to a customer. In my country Guyana we have seen the collapse of a few banks which sent a shock wave across the county for those that have savings held at those bank. We have also seen unsecured loans having to be written off thus putting serious pressure of those banks. So government stepped in a few years ago and amended the act to make it mandatory to have commercial banks follow certain strict guidelines before approving a loan.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why are interest rates on saving accounts so low in USA and Europe?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why does short selling require borrowing?,"This can be best explained with an example.

Bob immediately sells the shares to Charlie for 25, it is fair, it is the current market price. A week goes by, and the price does fall to 20. Bob buys a share from David at 20. This is fair, it is the current market value. Then Bob gives the share back to Alice to settle what he borrowed from her, one share. Now, in reality, there is interest charged be Alice on the borrowed value, but to keep it simple, well say she was a friend and it was a zero interest loan. So then Bob was able to sell something he didnt own for 25 and return it spending 20 to buy it, settling his loan and making 5 in the transaction. It is the selling to Charlie and buying from David or even Charlie later, if he decided to dump the shares, without having invested any of your own money that earns the profit.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why does short selling require borrowing?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Do Banks Cause Inflation? What are other possible causes?,"There are several causes of inflation. One is called cost push  that is, if the price of e.g. oil goes up sharply as it did in the 1970s, it creates inflation by making everything cost more. Another is called demand pull if labor unions bargain for higher wages as they did in the 1960s, their wage costs push up prices, especially after they start buying. The kind of inflation that the banks cause is monetary inflation. That is, for every dollar of deposits, they can make 5 or 10 of loans. So even though they dont ""print"" money the Fed does its as if they did.

Why did gold dip in 2011 ,"The cause of the increase in 20062011 was the financial crisis, where, if you recall, the global banking system came close to collapse for reasons that are well documented. Rightly or wrongly, gold is seen as a safe haven asset in times of crisis. The price of gold began to decline in 2011 when the markets decided that the risk of a global banking system collapse had passed without further incident. In the period leading up to 2006, the price of gold was in a flattodown trend because there was little net buying interest in gold and large gold sales had been executed by various central banks around the world who felt that gold no longer had a place in central bank reserves. In modern economies gold is seen as a ""fringe"" asset. It has no role to play. The recent financial crisis may have dented that perception, but those dents are now being forgotten and the price of gold is returning to its longterm downward trend. When the next financialbanking crisis is upon us, the price of gold will again probably rally. The extent of the rally will depend on the extent of the crisis.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why did gold dip in 2011?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Buy or sell futures contracts,"Futures contracts are a member of a larger class of financial assets called derivatives. Derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets financial or real. Other kinds of derivatives are call options, put options. Fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds, puttable bonds etc. A futures contract is a contract that specifies the following Just like with any other contract, there are two parties involved. One party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price. The other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset. There is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract. The language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract. The agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract. So answer your question, buying on June 1 a futures contract at the futures price of 100, with a maturity date on August 1 means you commit to paying 100 for the underlying asset on August 1.

Is it bad etiquette to use a credit or debit card to pay for single figure amounts at the POS,"Until the CARD act, credit card rules required that merchants had no minimum purchase requirement to use a card.

Index ETF or Index mutual fund  standard brokerage account,"The main difference between a mutual fund and an ETF are how they are bought and sold from the investors perspective. An ETF is transacted on the open market. This means you normally cant buy partial shares with your initial investment. Having to transact on the open market also means you pay a market price. The market price is always a little bit different from the Net Asset Value NAV of the fund. During market hours, the ETF will trade at a premiumdiscount to the NAV calculated on the previous day. Morningstars fund analysis will show a graph of the premiumdiscount to NAV for an ETF. With a mutual fund on the other hand, your investment goes to a fund company, which then grants you shares while under the hood buying the underlying investments. You pay the NAV price and are allowed to buy partial shares. Usually an ETF has a lower expense ratio, but if thats equal and any initial feescommissions are equal, I would prefer the mutual fund in order to buy partial shares so your initial investment will be fully invested and so you dont have to worry about paying premium to NAV",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Index ETF or Index mutual fund  standard brokerage account?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What would be the signs of a bubble in silver?,"The problem with commodities is that they dont produce income. With a stock or bond, even if you never sold it to anyone or it wasnt publicly traded, you know you can collect the money the company makes or collect interest. Thats a quantifiable income from the security. By computing the present value of that income cf. httpblog.ometer.com20070826moneymath you can have at least a rough sense of the value of the stock or bond investment. Commodities, on the other hand, eat income insurance and storage. Their value comes from their practical uses e.g. in manufacturing which eventually results in income for someone and from psychological factors. The psychological factors are inherently unpredictable. Demand due to practical uses should keep up with inflation, since in principle the prices on whatever products you make from the commodity would keep up with inflation. But even here theres a danger, because it may be that over time some popular uses for a given commodity become obsolete. For example this commodity used to be a bigger deal than now, I guess httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFrankincense. The reverse is also possible, that new uses for a commodity drive up demand and prices. To the extent that metals such as silver and gold bounce around wildly much more so than inflation, I find it hard to believe the bouncing is mostly due to changes in uses of the metals. It seems far more likely that its due to psychological factors and momentum traders. To me this makes metals a speculative investment, and identifying a bubble in metals is even harder than identifying one in incomeproducing assets that can more easily be valued. To identify a bubble you have to figure out what will go on in the minds of a horde of other people, and when. It seems safest for individual investors to just assume commodities are always in a bubble and stay away. The one arguable reason to own commodities is to treat them as a random bouncing number, which may enhance returns as long as you rebalance even if on average commodities dont make money over inflation. This is what people are saying when they suggest owning a small slice of commodities as part of an asset allocation. If you do this you have to be careful not to expect to make money on the commodities themselves, i.e. they are just something to sell some of rebalance out of whenever theyve happened to go up a lot.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What would be the signs of a bubble in silver?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

why is the money withdrawn from traditional IRA taxed at the ordinary income tax rate?,"You are missing something very significant. The money in a traditional IRA specifically, a deductible traditional IRA there is not really any reason to keep a nondeductible traditional IRA anymore is pretax. That means when you pay tax on it when you take it out, you are paying tax on it for the first time. If you take ordinary money to invest it in stocks, and then pay capital gains tax on it when you take it out, that is posttax money to begin with  meaning that you have already paid income tax on it once. Then you have to pay tax again on the timevalue growth of that money i.e. that growth is earned from money that is already taxed. That means you are effectively paying tax twice on part of that money. If that doesnt make sense to you, and you think that interest, capital gains, etc. is the first time youre paying tax on the money because its growth, then you have a very simplistic view of money. Theres something called time value of money, which means that a certain amount of money is equivalent to a greater amount of money in the future. If you invest 100 now and end up with 150 in the future, that 150 in the future is effectively the same money as the 100 now. Lets consider a few examples. Lets say you have 1000 of pretax income you want to invest and withdraw a certain period of time later in retirement. Lets say you have an investment that grows 100 over this period of time. And lets say that your tax rate now and in the future is 25 and for simplicity, assume that all income is taxed at that rate instead of the tax bracket system. And capital gains tax is 15. You see a few things Traditional IRA and Roth IRA are equivalent if the tax rates are the same. This is because, in both cases, you pay tax one time on the money the only difference between paying tax now and later is the tax rate. It doesnt matter that youre paying tax only on the principal for the Roth and on the principal plus earnings for Traditional, because the principal now is equivalent to the principal plus earnings in the future. And you also see that investing money outside fares worse than both of them. That is because you are paying tax on the money once plus some more. When you compare it against the Roth IRA, the disadvantage is obvious  in both cases you pay income tax on the principal, but for Roth IRA you pay nothing on the earnings, whereas for the outside stock, you pay some tax on the earnings. What may be less obvious is it is equally disadvantageous compared to a Traditional IRA Traditional and Roth IRA are equivalent in this comparison. 401ks and IRAs have a fundamental tax benefit compared to normal money investment, because they allow money to be taxed only one time. No matter how low the capital gains tax rate it, it is still worse because it is a tax on timevalue growth from money that is already taxed.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: why is the money withdrawn from traditional IRA taxed at the ordinary income tax rate?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How should I invest my money as a young graduate in Europe?,"Before starting with investing, you should make sure you are saving enough. Living in a welfare country France does not exempt you from potentially needing to save large amounts of money. You state that you do not need much of an emergency day fund, but this is not true. Being dismissed unjustly from your job is not the only way to become unemployed and not all roads lead to unemployment pay. Being fired for cause or leaving your job voluntarily are two work related causes that will leave you without an income source. Unexpected major expenses are another reason you might need to dip into your emergency fund. If your emergency fund is in order, the next thing to investigate is your pension and saving for retirement. In a country with a strong pension system, you need to check how comfortable you are with its sustainability Greece anyone? and also whether it will adequately meet your needs. If not, there are no 401ks or IRAs in France, but there is a relatively new personal supplementary pension plan PERP that you might investigate contributing to. If youre comfortable with your emergency fund and your retirement savings, then preparing for buying a house is likely your next savings goal. A quick search shows that to get a mortgage to buy a house in France, banks will commonly require a downpayment of 20 plus various closing costs. See for example here. This is 40,000 euro for a 200k euro house, which will take you several years at the rate of 500 euro  month.

"In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive?","Im kind of shocked that no formal behavioral modeling has been proposed as an explanation yet. One such model would be steep hyperbolic, quasihyperbolic discounting. Consumers would rather pay for popcorn later than for an expensive movie ticket now. For instance, consumers might when purchasing the ticket see a low value of popcorn and view the ticket price as the whole price because they do not predict purchasing popcorn. Then when entering the theater, the present value of popcorn is very high and they purchase it. There might therefore be a market for a commitment device such as a popcornless theater to make the appropriate decision exante. Another commitment device that seems to be practiced is when individuals sneak their own popcorn into the theater. They may not actually want the popcorn, but by bringing their own they ensure they do not purchase the theaters.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it easier for brokers to find shares to short in premarket?,"I dont think that the trading volume would impact a brokers ability to find shares to short. You might think that a lot more people are trying to short a stock during regular trading hours than in the premarket, and thats probably true. But whats also true is that a lot more people are covering their shorts during regular trading hours than in the premarket. For stocks that have difficulty in finding shares to short, any time someone covers a short is an opportunity for you to enter a short. If you want to short a stock and your broker is rejecting your order because they cant find shares to short, then I would recommend that you continue placing that order throughout the day. You might get lucky and submit one of those orders right after someone else has covered their short and before anyone else can enter a short.

To rebalance or not to rebalance,"Buy and Hold Is Still a Winner An investor who used index funds and stayed the course could have earned satisfactory returns even during the first decade of the 21st century. by By Burton G. Malkiel in The Wall Street Journal on November 18, 2010 ""The other useful technique is ""rebalancing,"" keeping the portfolio asset allocation consistent with the investors risk tolerance. For example, suppose an investor was most comfortable choosing an initial allocation of 60 equities, 40 bonds. As stock and bond prices change, these proportions will change as well. Rebalancing involves selling some of the asset class whose share is above the desired allocation and putting the money into the other asset class. From 1996 through 1999, annually rebalancing such a portfolio improved its return by 1 and 13 percentage points per year versus a strategy of making no changes.""

I, for example, receive email notifications from my brokerage firm each time theres another IPO that they have access to, and I can ask the brokerage to buy stocks from the IPO on my behalf. When that happens  they dont buy the stocks themselves and then sell to me. No, what happens is that I buy a stock, through them, and they charge me a commission for the service. Usually IPO participation commissions are higher than regular trading commissions. Most of the time those who purchase stocks at IPO are institutional investors  i.e. mutual funds, pension plans, investment banks for their managed accounts, etc. Retail investors would probably not participate in the IPO because of the costs, limited access not all the brokerage firms have access to all the IPOs, and the uncertainty, and rather purchase the stocks later on a secondary market.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What does investment bank risk during IPO?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Do altcoin trades count as likekind exchanges? Deferred capital gains tax,"Likekind of exchanges have a list of requirements. The IRS has not issued formal guidance in the matter. I recommend to be aggressive and claim the exchange, while justifying it with a good analogy to prove good faith and persuade the IRS official reading it the risk of losing in tax court would be to high. Worst case the IRS will attempt to reject the exchange, at which point you could still pony up to get rid of the problem, interest being the only real risk. For example Past tax court rulings have stated that collectable gold coins are not like kind to gold bars, and unlike silver coins, but investment grade gold coins are like kind to gold bars. So you could use a justification like this I hold Bitcoin to be likekind to Litecoin, because they use the same fundamental technology with just a tweak in the math, as if exchanging different grades of gold bars, which has been approved by tax court ruling xxxxx. Note that it doesnt matter whether any of this actually makes sense, it just has be reasonable enough for you to believe, and look like it is not worth pursuing to an overworked IRS official glancing at it.

Interest on Amount Exceeding CC Balance?,"The best answer to this is Read the fine print on your credit card agreement. What is common, at least in the US, is that you can make any charges you want during a time window. When the date comes around that your statement balance is calculated, you will owe interest on any amount that is showing up as outstanding in your account. Example... To revise the example you gave, lets say Jan 1. your account balance was 0. Jan. 3rd you went out and spent 1,000. Your account statement will be prepared every XX days... usually 30. So if your last statement was Dec. 27th, you can expect your next statement to be prepared Jan.24 or Jan. 27. To be safe, i.e. not accrue any interest charges you will want to make sure that your balance shows 0 when your statement is next prepared. So back to the example you gaveif your balance showed 1,000... and you paid it off, but then charged 2,000 to it... so that there was now a new set of 2,000 charges in your account, then the bank would begin charging you interest when your next statement was prepared. Note that there are some cards that give you a certain number of days to pay off charges before accruing interest... it just goes back to my saying ""the best answer is read the fine print on your card agreement.""",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Interest on Amount Exceeding CC Balance?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why would anyone want to pay off their debts in a way other than highest interest first?,"This is a slightly different reason to any other answer I have seen here about irrationality and how being rationally aware of ones irrationality in the future or in different circumstances can lead you to make decisions which on the face of it seem wrong. First of all, why do people sometimes maintain balances on highinterest debt when they have savings? Standard advice on many moneymanagement sites and forums is to withdraw the savings to pay down the debt. However, I think there is a problem with this. Suppose you have 5,000 in a savings account, and a 2,000 credit card balance. You are paying more interest on the credit card than you get from the savings account, and it seems that you should withdraw some money from the savings account, and pay off the cc. However, the difference between the two scenarios, other than the interest you lose by keeping the cc balance, is your motivation for saving. If you have a credit card balance of 2,000, you might be obliged to pay a minimum payment of 100 each month. If you have any extra money, you will be rewarded if you pay more in to the credit card, by seeing the balance go down and understanding that you will soon be free from receiving this awful bill each month. To maintain your savings goal, its enough to agree with yourself that you wont do any new spending on the cc, or withdraw any savings. Now suppose that you decide to pay off the cc with the savings. There is now nothing forcing you to save 100 each month. When you get to the end of the month, you have to motivate yourself that you will be adding spare cash to your 3,000 savings balance, rather than that you have to pay down your cc. Yes, if you spend the spare cash instead of saving it, you get something in return for it. But it is possible that spending 140 on smallscale discretionary spending things you dont need actually gets you less for your money than paying the credit card company 40 interest and saving 100? You might even be tempted to start spending on your credit card again, knowing that you have a 0 balance, and that you can always pay it off out of savings. Its easy to analogize this to a situation with two types of debt. Suppose that you have a 2,000 debt to your parents with no interest and a 2,000 loan at high interest, and you get a 2,000 windfall. Lets assume that your parents dont need the money in a hurry and arent hassling you to pay them otherwise you could consider the guilt or the hassle as a form of emotional interest rate. Might it not be better to pay your parents off? If you do, you are likely to keep paying off your loan out of necessity of making the regular payments. In 20 paychecks or whatever you might be debt free. If you pay off your loan, you lose the incentive to save. After 20 months you still owe your parents 2,000. I am not saying that this is always what makes sense. Just that it could make sense. Note that this is an opposite to the Debt Snowball method. That method says that its better to pay off small debts, because that way you have more free cash flow to pay off the larger debts. The above argues that this is a bad idea, because you might spend the increased cash flow on junk. It would be better to keep around as many things as possible which have minimum payments, because it restricts you to paying things rather than gives you the choice of whether to save or spend.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."

When does it make sense for the money paid for equity to go to the corporation?,"If the check is written as a check to BigCo, it is less clear how Jack can compensate himself for the equity sale. It is as if the equity was owned by the corporation, not by Jack. This is correct. If the check is written to BigCo, then it is BigCo issuing new shares. Jack doesnt compensate himself for the equity sale, as he didnt sell anything. The company traded shares for money which it uses for expansion. In the long term, the capital gain from expansion may exceed the value of a 200,000 nointerest loan to the company. If the value of the company before investing 250,000 is 1 million, then the value after investing is 1.25 million. So 250,000 is 20 of the value of the company. BigCo should not give the buyer 25 of BigCo but only 20 in that example. If it does give 25, the buyer is getting a 312,500 stake for only 250,000. With the other example, Jack sells 25 of the company for 250,000 from his personal shares. This doesnt change the assessed value of the company, just Jacks stake. Jack then loans the company 200,000. This also doesnt change the assessed value of the company at least in theory. It gains 200,000 but has an offsetting debt of 200,000. In net, thats no change. Assets and liabilities balance the same. So if you know that the assessed value of the company is 1 million and that the buyer is paying 250,000 for a 25 stake at that same valuation, then you know that the check is being written to Jack. If the check is written to BigCo, then one or more of those numbers is incorrect. The buyer could be getting a 20 stake. The new value of the company after the investment is 1.25 million. Or paying 333,333.33. The new value of the company after the investment is 1,333,333.33. Or BigCo could only be worth 750,000 before the investment. The new value of the company after the investment is 1 million. Or Jack is getting screwed, selling 312,500 in stock 25 for only 250,000. Jacks shares drop from being worth 1 million to only 937,500.

How can IV give an indication of the markets opinion about a stock when theres no such thing as IV for a stock?,"Since nearterm atthemoney ATM options are generally the most liquid, the listed implied vol for a stock is usually pretty close to the nearest ATM volatility, but theres not a set convention that Im aware of.

Not exactly. Its an annualized standard deviation of the anticipated movements over the time period of the option that its implied from. Implied vol for nearterm options can be higher or lower than longerterm options, depending on if the market believes that there will be more uncertainty in the shortterm. Also, its the bounds of the expected movement in that time period. so if a stock is at 100 with an implied vol of 30 for 1year term options, then the market thinks that the stock will be somewhere between 70 and 130 after 1 year. If you look at the implied vol for a 6month term option, half of that vol is the range of expected movement in 6 months.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can IV give an indication of the markets opinion about a stock when theres no such thing as IV for a stock?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it possible to block previously authorized ACH access?,"I had a similar situation a while ago, and heres what I learned What are our options here to ensure that this company cant retry to take our money again via ACH? Close existing account and create a new one that has different account number? Yes. As a temporary solution keep 0 balance in the account so that their request for 840 cant be fulfilled? However, would our bank incur any fees because of insufficient funds each time the other company tries to charge us again? Bad idea. You may incur penalties for returned payment, or the bank may honor the payment and charge you overdraft fees. Provide to our bank the service termination notice that proves that we are not in business with the other company anymore and effectively block them. However, termination notice has only our signature Bank doesnt care. ACH withdrawal is akin to a check. The assumption is that the other side has entitlement. You can put stop payment once its processed and try to reverse it claiming fraud, but the end result will be 1 youll end up getting a new account set up, while they try to recover the money.

Beginner dividend investor  first steps,"How do I start? What broker do I use? We dont make specific recommendations because in a few years that might not be the best recommendation any more. You are willing to do your own research, so here are some things to look for when choosing a broker What criticism do you have for my plan? Seeking dividend paying stock is a sensible way to generate income, but share prices can still be very volatile for a conservative investor. A good strategy might be to invest in several broad market index and bond funds in a specific allocation for example you might choose 50 stocks and 50 bonds. Then as the market moves, your stocks might increase by 15 one year while bonds stay relatively flat, so at the beginning of the next year you can sell some of your stocks and buy bonds so that you are back to a 5050 allocation. The next year there might be a stock market correction, so you sell some of your bonds and buy stock until you are back to a 5050 allocation. This is called rebalancing, and it doesnt require you to look at the market daily, just on a regular interval every 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year, whatever interval you are comfortable with. Rebalancing will give you greater gains than a static portfolio, and it can insulate you from losses when the stock market panics occasionally if you choose a conservative allocation.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Beginner dividend investor  first steps?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"700 guaranteed to not be touched for 15 years, should I put it anywhere other than a savings account?","Since you used the dollar sign without any qualification, I assume youre in the United States and talking about US dollars. You have a few options here. I wont make a specific recommendation, but will present some options and hopefully useful information. Heres the short story To buy individual stocks, you need to go through a broker. These brokers charge a fee for every transaction, usually in the neighborhood of 7. Since you probably wont want to just buy and hold a single stock for 15 years, the fees are probably unreasonable for you. If you want the educational experience of picking stocks and managing a portfolio, I suggest not using real money. Most mutual funds have minimum investments on the order of a few thousand dollars. If you shop around, there are mutual funds that may work for you. In general, look for a fund that An example of a fund that meets these requirements is SWPPX from Charles Schwabb, which tracks the SP 500. Buy the product directly from the mutual fund company if you go through a broker or financial manager theyll try to rip you off. The main advantage of such a mutual fund is that it will probably make your daughter significantly more money over the next 15 years than the safer options. The tradeoff is that you have to be prepared to accept the volatility of the stock market and the possibility that your daughter might lose money. Your daughter can buy savings bonds through the US Treasurys TreasuryDirect website. There are two relevant varieties You and your daughter seem to be the intended customers of these products they are available in low denominations and they guarantee a rate for up to 30 years. The Series I bonds are the only product I know of thats guaranteed to keep pace with inflation until redeemed at an unknown time many years in the future. It is probably not a big concern for your daughter in these amounts, but the interest on these bonds is exempt from state taxes in all cases, and is exempt from Federal taxes if you use them for education expenses. The main weakness of these bonds is probably that theyre too safe. You can get better returns by taking some risk, and some risk is probably acceptable in your situation. Savings accounts, including socalled ""money market accounts"" from banks are a possibility. They are very convenient, but you might have to shop around for one that I dont have any particular insight into whether these are likely to outperform or be outperformed by treasury bonds. Remember, however, that the interest rates are not guaranteed over the long run, and that money lost to inflation is significant over 15 years. Certificates of deposit are what a bank wants you to do in your situation you hand your money to the bank, and they guarantee a rate for some number of months or years. You pay a penalty if you want the money sooner. The longest terms Ive typically seen are 5 years, but there may be longer terms available if you shop around. You can probably get better rates on CDs than you can through a savings account. The rates are not guaranteed in the long run, since the terms wont last 15 years and youll have to get new CDs as your old ones mature. Again, I dont have any particular insight on whether these are likely to keep up with inflation or how performance will compare to treasury bonds. Watch out for the same things that affect savings accounts, in particular fees and reduced rates for balances of your size.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: 700 guaranteed to not be touched for 15 years, should I put it anywhere other than a savings account?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

How could USA defaulting on its public debt influence the stockbond market?,"This is a speculative question and theres no ""correct"" answer, but there are definitely some highly likely outcomes. Lets assume that the United States defaults on its debt. It can be guaranteed that it will lose its AAA rating. Although we dont know what it will drop to, we know it WILL be AA or lower. A tripleA rating implies that the issuer will never default, so it can offer lower rates since there is a guarantee of safety there.People will demand a higher yield for the lower perceived security, so treasury yield will go up. The US dollar, or at least forex rates, will almost certainly fall. Since US treasuries will no longer be a safe haven, the dollar will no longer be the safe currency it once was, and so the dollar will fall. The US stock market and international markets will also have a strong fall because so many institutions, financial or otherwise, invest in treasuries so when treasuries tumble and the US loses tripleA, investments will be hurt and the tendency is for investors to overreact so it is almost guaranteed that the market will drop sharply. Financial stocks and companies that invest in treasuries will be hurt the most. A notable exception is nations themselves. For example, China holds over 1 trillion in treasuries and a US default will hurt their value, but the Yuan will also appreciate with respect to the dollar. Thus, other nations will benefit and be hurt from a US default. Now many people expect a doubledip recession  worse than the 0809 crisis  if the US defaults. I count myself a member of this crowd. Nonetheless, we cannot say with certainty whether or not there will be another recession or even a depression  we can only say that a recession is a strong possibility. So basically, lets pray that Washington gets its act together and raises the ceiling, or else were in for bad times. And lastly, a funny quote  I could end the deficit in 5 minutes.

Many brokers are aware of this problem and will assist by buying these securities from you at a nominal price ETrade, for example, for 0.01, ScotTrade for 0.00, and providing a proper trade confirmation. This is a bona fide sale, so if the stock does regain value  it will be a profit for the broker. In this case  you just report it as a sale at loss.

Unfortunately if it were that simple everyone would be making money hand over fist in the market.

They intentionally choose not to learn about how to read a companys financial report and they intentionally choose not to learn how to compare one stock to another. They also dont consider the fact that most of their data is 15 or more min old because of the shady rules brokers have worked into the system.

How do I calculate ownership percentage for shared home ownership?,"Once your sister and you make your first payments, youve paid 20,645, and your sister has paid 1400.

Unless Im misunderstanding what the term means, 2045 is an absurdly high amount for a monthly escrow payment. So your sister now has made a net capital contribution of ... negative 645. So youre giving your sister a gift of 7740 each year, and are the sole equity owner of the house. Theres a 14000year gift tax exclusion, and I think that both you and your husband can claim it separately, so every year you could declare your sister to have 20260 added to her capital contribution, or more if youre willing to pay gift tax. But as it stands, if there are any losses from the property, they will be borne exclusively by you therefore, any profits should be enjoyed exclusively by you. Any other arrangement is you giving a gift to your sister.

Can one use dollar cost averaging to make money with something highly volatile?,"if you know when and by how much something will fluctuate, you can always make money. Buy it when its cheaper and sell it when its more expensive. If you just know that it fluctuated a lot recently, then you dont know what it will do next. Most securities that go to zero or go much higher bounce all over the place for a while first. But you dont know when theyll move decisively lower or higher. So how could you figure out if youll make money  you cant know. DCA will on average make you better off, unless the extra commissions are too high relative to your purchase sizes. But it will in retrospect make you worse off in many particular cases. This is true of many investment disciplines, such as rebalancing. They are all based on averages. If the volatility is random then on average you can buy more shares when the price is lower using DCA. But when the lowest price turns out to have been on a certain day, youd have been better off with a single lump sum put in on that day. No way to know in advance. Degree of volatility shouldnt matter any fluctuation is enough for DCA or rebalancing to get you ahead, though its true they get you ahead farther if the fluctuations are larger, since theres then more difference between DCA and a lump purchase. I think the real reason to do DCA and rebalancing is risk control. They reduce the risk of putting a whole lump sum in on exactly the wrong day. And they can help keep a portfolio growing even if the market is stagnant.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can one use dollar cost averaging to make money with something highly volatile?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Can you step up your cost basis indefinitely via the 0 capital gains rate?,"Your real question, ""why is this not discussed more?"" is intriguing. I think the media are doing a better job bringing these things into the topics they like to ponder, just not enough, yet. You actually produced the answer to How are longterm capital gains taxed if the gain pushes income into a new tax bracket? so you understand how it works. I am a fan of bracket topping. e.g. A young couple should try to top off their 15 bracket by staying with Roth but then using pretax IRA401k to not creep into 25 bracket. For this discussion, 2013 numbers, a blank return i.e. no schedule A, no other income shows a couple with a gross 92,500 being at the 1525 line. It happens that 20K is exactly the sum of their standard deduction, and 2 exemptions. The last clean Distribution of Income Data is from 2006, but since wages havent exploded and inflation has been low, its fair to say that from the 92,000 representing the top 20 of earners, it wont have many more than top 25 today. So, yes, this is a great opportunity for most people. Any married couple with under that 92,500 figure can use this strategy to exploit your observation, and step up their basis each year. To littleadv objection  I imagine an older couple grossing 75K, by selling stock with 10K in LT gains just getting rid of the potential 15 bill at retirement. No trading cost if a mutual fund, just 20 or so if stocks. The more important point, not yet mentioned  even in a low cost 401k, a lifetime of savings results in all gains being turned in ordinary income. And the case is strong for deposit to the match but no no more as this strategy would let 23 of us pay zero on those gains. To try to address the rest of your questions a bit  the strategy applies to a small sliver of people. 25 have income too high, the bottom 50 or so, have virtually no savings. Much of the 25 that remain have savings in tax sheltered accounts. With the 2013 401k limit of 17,500, a 40 year old couple can save 35,000.

Either way, if they do take the car away from you, theyll be doing you a service you have a 6,000 car that you owe 12,000 on. Let them, and walk away and buy another car for 6,000. Second, Im not sure they would be allowed to in any event. See the Illinois DMV page on correcting titles in the case of a deceased owner Illinois I believe is a joint tenancy state, meaning that once one owner dies, the other just gets the car and the loan, though the loan documents would cover that. Unless you had an explicit agreement with your grandfather, anyway. From that page Joint Ownership A title in the names of two or more persons is considered to be in joint tenancy. Upon the death of one of them, the surviving joint tenants becomes the owners of the vehicle by law. Third, your grandfather can fix all of this fairly easily by mentioning the disposition of the car and loan in his will, if hes still mentally competent and wishes to do so. If he transfers his ownership of the car to you in the will, it seems like that would be that though again, its not clear that the ownership wouldnt just be yours anyway.

Is there a debit card that earns miles 1 mile per 1 spent and doesnt have an annual fee?,"I dont know of any that are comparable to credit cards. Theres a reason for that. Debit cards, being newer, have a much lower interchange rate. Since collecting on debt is risky and less predictable, rewards  miles are paid from those interchange fees. This means with a debit card theres less money to pay you with. So what can you do? Assuming your credit isnt terrible, you can just open a credit card account and pay in full for purchases by the grace period. I dont know how all cards work, but my grace period allows me to pay in full by the billing date roughly a month from purchase and incur no finance charges. In effect, I get a small 30 day loan with no interest, and a cash back incentive I dislike miles.

Renters Liability in Case of Liability Claims for Property Damage or Fire,"According to US News, renters insurance does cover liability as well as your own belongings.

Those were the first three working links for ""what does renters insurance cover"" on Google. In short, while it is possible that you currently have a different kind of coverage, this is not a limitation of renters insurance per se. It could be a limitation in your current coverage. You may be able to simply change your coverage with your current provider. Or switch providers. Or you may already be covered. Note that renters insurance does not cover the building against general damage, e.g. tornado or a fire spreading from an adjacent building. It is specific to covering things that you caused. This may be the cause of the confusion, as some sources say that it doesnt cover anything in the building. Thats generally not true.

Can a stock exchange company actually go bust?,"Technically, of course. Almost any company can go bankrupt. One small note a company goes bankrupt, not its stock. Its stock may become worthless in bankruptcy, but a stock disappearing or being delisted doesnt necessarily mean the company went bankrupt. Bankruptcy has implications for a companys debt as well, so it applies to more than just its stock. I dont know of any historical instances where this has happened, but presumably, the warning signs of bankruptcy would be evident enough that a few things could happen. Another company, e.g. another exchange, holding firm, etc. could buy out the exchange thats facing financial difficulty, and the companies traded on it would transfer to the new company thats formed. If another exchange bought out the struggling exchange, the shares of the latter could transfer to the former. This is an attractive option because exchanges possess a great deal of infrastructure already in place. Depending on the country, this could face regulatory scrutiny however. Other firms or governments could bail out the exchange if no one presented a buyout offer. The likelihood of this occurring depends on several factors, e.g. political will, the governments in question, etc. For a smaller exchange, the exchange could close all open positions at a set price. This is exactly what happened with the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange HKMex that MSalters mentioned. When the exchange collapsed in May 2013, it closed all open positions for their price on the Thursday before the shutdown date. I dont know if a stock exchange would simply close all open positions at a set price, since equity technically exists in perpetuity regardless of the shutdown of an exchange, while many derivatives have an expiration date. Furthermore, this might not be a feasible option for a large exchange. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange lists thousands of products and manages hundreds of millions of transactions, so closing all open positions could be a significant undertaking. If none of the above options were available, I presume companies listed on the exchange would actively move to other, more financially stable exchanges. These companies wouldnt simply go bankrupt. Contracts can always be listed on other exchanges as well. Considering the high level of mergers and acquisitions, both unsuccessful and successful, in the market for exchanges in recent years, I would assume that option 1 would be the most likely see the NYSE EuronextDeutsche Brse merger talks and the NYSE EuronextICE merger thats currently in progress, but for smaller exchanges, there is the recent historical precedent of the HKMex that speaks to 3. Also, the above answer really only applies to publicly traded stock exchanges, and not all stock exchanges are publiclyheld entities. For example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is a quasigovernmental organization, so I presume option 2 would apply because it already receives government backing. Its bankruptcy would mean something occurred for the government to withdraw its backing or that it became public, and a discussion of those events occurring in the future is pure speculation.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can a stock exchange company actually go bust?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Investment strategy for 401k when rolling over soon,"You will be rolling over the proceeds, since you can only deposit cash into an IRA. However, this should probably not affect your considerations much since the prerollover sale is nontaxable within the 401k and the period of rollover itself when the cash is uninvested is relatively short. So, whatever investments you choose in your 401k, youll just sell them and then buy them or similar investments back after the rollover to the IRA. If youre worrying about a flash crash right on the day when you want to cash out  that can definitely happen, but it is not really something you can prepare for. You can consider moving to money market several weeks before the potential date of your withdrawal, if you think it will make you feel safer, otherwise I dont think it really matters.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Why is property investment good if properties devaluate over time?,"There are many different reasons to buy property and its important to make a distinction between commercial and residential property. Historically owning property has been part of the American dream, for multiple reasons. But to answer your questions, value is not based on the age of the building however it can be in a historic district. In addition the price of something and its value may or may not be directly related for each individual buyerowner because that becomes subjective. Some buildings can lose there value as time passes, but the depends on multiple factors area, condition of the building, overall economy, etc. so its not that easy to give a specific answer to a general question. Before you buy property amongst many things its important to determine why you want to buy this property what will be its principal use for you. That will help you determine if you should buy an old or new property, but that pales in comparison to if the property will maintain and gain in value. Also if your looking for an investment look into REIT Real Estate Investment Trust. These can be great. Why? Because you dont actually have to carry the mortgage. Which makes that ideal for people who want to own property but not have to deal with the everyday insandouts of the responsibility of ownership....like rising cost.

"If one owns 75 of company shares, does that mean that he would have to take upon himself 75 of the companys expenses?","Another way to decide would be to do a fair valuation of the company agreeable to both the partners. Lets assume when you started the company it was worth 10,000 and to acquire 75, you must have put 7,500 worth of money and effort. Similarly, the other partner must have put 2,500 worth of time and money. Now say after 2 years, you both agree that company is worth 50,000. And say now the company needs 10,000 worth of investment. Whoever invests that money should get 20 10k50k of the company. Or each 1,000 will buy 2 in the company. Post this investment the equity division would be First investor you 75 of 80  60  Second investor your partner 25 of 80  20 Third new investor  20 Now, if you alone decide to put all the money you stake will be 60  20  80 and your partner will be reduced to 20. If you guys want to maintain equity as it was 7525, you need to put money in the same ratio 7500 and 2500. If you do that First investor 60  15 for 7,500  75 Second investor 20  5 for 2,500  25.

Why do people buy new cars they can not afford? ,"I would answer your question very simply marketing works.

How can this be enough to fund a scholarship in perpetuity?,"The Trinity study looked at safe withdrawal rates from retirement portfolios. They found it was safe to withdraw 4 of a portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds. I cannot immediately find exactly what specific investment allocations they used, but note that they found a portfolio consisting largely of stocks would allow for the withdrawal of 3  4 and still keep up with inflation. In this case, if you are able to fund 30,000, the study claims it would be safe to withdraw 900  1200 a year that is, pay out as scholarships while allowing the scholarship to grow sufficiently to cover inflation, and that this should work in perpetuity. My guess is that they invest such scholarship funds in a fairly aggressive portfolio. Most likely, they choose something along these lines 70  80 stocks and 20  30 bonds. This is probably more risky than youd want to take, but should give higher returns than a more conservative portfolio of perhaps 50  60 stocks, 40  50 bonds, over the long term. Just a regular, interestbearing savings account isnt going to be enough. They almost never even keep up with inflation. Yes, if the stock market or the bond market takes a hit, the investment will suffer. But over the long term, it should more than recover the lost capital. Such scholarships care far more about the very long term and can weather a few years of bad returns. This is roughly similar to retirement planning. If you expect to be retired for, say, 10 years, you wont worry too much about pulling out your retirement funds. But its quite possible to retire early say, at 40 and plan for an infinite retirement. You just need a lot more money to do so. 3 million, invested appropriately, should allow you to pull out approximately 90,000 a year adjusted upward for inflation forever. I leave the specifics of how to come up with 3 million as an exercise for the reader.  As an aside, theres a Memorial and Traffic Safety Fund which kindly and gently solicited a 10,000 donation after my wife was killed in a motor vehicle accident. That would have provided annual donations in her name, in perpetuity. This shows you dont need 30,000 to set up a scholarship or a fund. I chose to go another way, but it was an option I seriously considered. Edit The Trinity study actually only looked at a 30 year withdrawal period. So long as the investment wasnt exhausted within 30 years, it was considered a success. The Trinity study has also been criticised when it comes to retirement. Nevertheless, theres some withdrawal rate at which point your investment is expected to last forever.

"Buying a house, how much should my down payment be?","Mortgage qualification is typically done based on pretax income. To keep the math easy, lets assume 10Kmonth gross. A well written loan allows 28 or 2800 to be used for the mortgage and property tax. Property tax varies, but 1 is the average of the 2 states mentioned. This results in 7500yr property or 625mo tax leaving 2175mo. Note here  OP stated 750K house. 2175 will finance 450K at 430 years. 2175 will finance 300K at 3.5 15years. Let me pause here.

Why will the bank only loan us 80 of the value of our fully paid for home?,"I am going to add just one more item to what are some very well thought out answers. The element of ""Cash Out"" If you are taking out 80 of the value of the home that you already own free and clear the bank considers this a ""Cash Out"" transaction  meaning you would effectively walk away from closing with a check for 80 of your homes value. So in a hypothetical situation you have a 200,000 home value  you would be handed a check for 160,000 with which you could do anything that you wanted. Granted, you are likely going to do something responsible with it and purchase another home  BUT big BUT the bank cant control what you do with it and that is the part they dont like  and therefore they treat these types of transactions with a higher degree of scrutiny. It is all about control  if the property you are downsizing to fits their rules for lending they may actually loan you a higher loan to value on that purchase than they would on your ""cash out"" refinance transaction on your current home. With the purchase loan the money you get goes immediately to the purchase of a new home. In the ""cash out"" transaction it goes to a check with which you could do anything you want . . . and then not pay the loan back . . . I know no one here would do that  but there are some folks that would . . . and this is one of the reasons ""Cash Out"" loans are not nearly as easy as they once were to get. httpwww.justice.govusaoazmortgagefraud.html",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why will the bank only loan us 80 of the value of our fully paid for home?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

You also dont seem to be a fan of buy and hold as you dont know what your investments will be worth when you need the funds. How about a combination of the two, sometimes called trend trading or active investing. With this type of tradinginvesting you may hold a stock from a couple of months to many years. Once you buy a stock that is uptrending or starting to uptrend you hold onto it until it stops uptrending.

Shared groceries expenses between roommates to be divided as per specific consumption ratio and attendance,"I asked how often grocery purchases are made in a comment, but Im going to assume weekly for simplicity. If a roommate is present during the week following a grocery purchase, then they owe a share according to their preferences as you outlined them above. You will have to track the grocery cost by category for that week and calculate the balance owed by the person for that week. If there is a partial week where most expect to leave for a holiday or otherwise, then fewer groceries should be purchased for that week, and the cost of shares will decrease accordingly. One need only indicate preferences once, and weekly attendance thereafter. The only issue remaining is to determine how to record shares. If a normal person consumes 3 shares of milk, and .5 shares of butter, and so on, you simply add up all of the milk shares for the week and divide the milk bill by those shares. Same with the butter. The downside of this method is that you have to predict consumption in advance, so you may instead calculate by consumption after the fact with a deposit paid by all to create the initial grocery supply which will be refunded when that person leaves the grocery purchase coop, and shares are calculated by who participated in the week prior to the grocery purchase. This also allows for a midweek refresh if any commodity incurs higher than expected consumption, with the midweek bill being added to the end of week refresh trip.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Shared groceries expenses between roommates to be divided as per specific consumption ratio and attendance?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

incorrect printed information on check stock,"Probably a bad assumption, but Im assuming your in the United States. Keep in mind, that the check number is printed in 2 places on the front of each check. First, in the upper right corner, and also along the bottom edge on of the check. Since the check number is scanned by the bank from the bottom edge of the check, covering or otherwise modifying the check number on the upper left corner will have no effect on the check number that is recorded when the check is processed. And, you cant modify or cover the numbers or place any marks in the area of the numbers along the bottom of the check as this will likely interfere with processing of checks. So, modifying the check numbers will not work. Your choices are basically to The check numbers are not used in any way in clearing the check, the numbers are only for your convenience, so processing checks with duplicate numbers wont matter. The check numbers are recorded when processed at your bank so they can be shown on your printed and online statements. The only time the check number might be important is if you had to ""stop payment"" on a particular check, or otherwise inquire about a particular check. But this should not really be an issue because by the time you have used up the first batch of checks, and start using the checks with duplicate numbers, the first use of the early duplicate numbered checks will be sufficiently long ago that there should not be any chance of processing checks with duplicate numbers at the same time.

Townhouse or standalone house for a first home?,"First, some general advice that I think you should consider A good rule of thumb on home buying is to wait to buy until you expect to live in the same place for at least 5 years. This period of time is meant to reduce the impact of closing costs, which can be 15 of your total buying  selling price. If you bought and sold in the same year, for example, then you might need to pay over 5 of the value of your home to realtors  lawyers! This means that for many people, it is unwise to buy a home expecting it to be your starter home, if you already are thinking about what your next presumably bigger home will look like. If you buy a townhouse expecting to sell it in 3 years to buy a house, you are partially gambling on the chance that increases in your townhomes value will offset the closing costs  mortgage interest paid. Increases in home value are not a sure thing. In many areas, the total costs of home ownership are about equivalent to the total costs of renting, when you factor in maintenance. I notice you dont even mention renting as an option  make sure you at least consider it, before deciding to buy! Also, dont buy a house expecting your life situation to make up the difference in your budget. If youre expecting your girlfriend to move in with you in a year, that implies that you arent living together now, and maybe havent talked about it. Even if she says now that she would move in within a year, theres no guarantee that things work out that way. Taking on a mortgage is a commitment that you need to take on yourself no one else will be liable for the payments. As for whether a townhouse or a detached house helps you meet your needs better, dont get caught up in terminology. There are few differences between houses  townhomes that are universal. Stereotypically townhomes are cheaper, smaller, noisier, and have condo associations with monthly fees to pay for maintenance on joint property. But that is something that differs on a casebycase basis. Dont get tricked into buying a 1,100 sq ft house with a restrictive HOA, instead of a 1,400 sq ft freehold townhouse, just because townhouses have a certain reputation. The only true difference between a house and a townhouse is that 1 or both of your walls are shared with a neighbor.

Stock misreporting the dividend on the preferred stock for the common stock, which has not paid a dividend thanks Brick for pointing this out!

Common stock holders can vote to alter the board of directors, and are the epitome of the typical ""I own a trivial fraction of the company"" model that most people think of when owning stocks.

Explain 3 annual cost of renting is less than the 9 annual cost of owning,"The house that sells for 200,000 might rent for a range of monthly numbers. 3 would be 6000yr or 500mo. This is absurdly low, and favors renting, not buying. 9 is 1500mo in which case buying the house to live in or rent out as a landlord is the better choice. At this level ""paying rent"" should be avoided. Im simply explaining the authors view, not advocating it. A quote from the article  annual rent  purchase price  3 means do not buy, prices are too high annual rent  purchase price  6 means borderline annual rent  purchase price  9 means ok to buy, prices are reasonable Edit to respond to Chucks comment  Mortgage rates for qualified applicants are pretty tight from low to high, the 30 year is about 4.4 and the 15, 3.45. Of course, a number of factors might mean paying more, but this is the average rate. And it changes over time. But the rent and purchase price in a given area will be different. Very different based on location. See what youd pay for 2000 sq feet in Manhattan vs a nice town in the MidWest. One can imagine a heat map, when an area might show an 800 rent on a house selling for 40,000 as a ""4.16"" The home price divided by annual rent and another area as a ""20"", where the 200K house might rent for 1667mo. Its not homogeneous through the US. As I said, Im not taking a position, just discussing how the author formulated his approach. The author makes some assertions that can be debatable, e.g. that low rates are a bad time to buy because they already pushed the price too high. In my opinion, the US has had the crash, but the rates are still low. Buying is a personal decision, and the ownrent ratios are only one tool to be added to a list of factors in making the decision. Of course the article, as written, does the math based on the rates at time of publication 430years. And the ratio of income to mortgage one can afford is tied to the current rate. The 60K couple, at 4, can afford just over a 260K mortgage, but at 6, 208K, and 8, 170K. The struggle isnt with the payment, but the downpayment. The analysis isnt too different for a purchase to invest.

If you are awarded options, then you can purchase the stock to start the clock on longterm capital gains, but you will not incur any tax liability through the initial purchase. If the company is sold privately and you have held the stock for over 1 year, then yes, it will be taxed as a longterm capital gain.

I need a car for 2 years. Buy or lease or something else?,"Your shortterm time frame makes buying used the best option, but it seems you already are aware of that. Look into a certified preowned model if you are concerned about lemons. You will usually get some sort of warranty. However, be aware that any car can be a headache with repairs. I would not recommend a lease because basically you are still paying for the depreciation on the car plus interest. Generally, this is the most expensive way to drive a car. You may find the numbers look good for a lease but beware of the gotchas in the terms that can put you way over budget over mileage, wear and tear, etc.. My best recommendation is to buy gently used with cash. This gives you the most flexibility and best resale value. If you finance a latemodel vehicle, be aware that depreciation can leave you upsidedown on your loan. That would put you in the position of having to shell out cash just to get rid of the car.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: I need a car for 2 years.

How does one value Facebook stock as a potential investment?,"To know if a stock is undervalued is not something that can be easily assessed else, everybody would know which stock is undervalued and everybody will buy it until it reaches its ""true"" value. But there are methods to assess the value of a company, I think that the 3 most known methods are If the assets of the company were to be sold right now and that all its debts were to be paid back right now, how much will be left? This remaining amount would be the fundamental value of your company. That method could work well on real estate company whose value is more or less the buildings that they own minus of much they borrowed to acquire them. Its not really usefull in the case of Facebook, as most of its business is immaterial. I know the value of several companies of the same sector, so if I want to assess the value of another company of this sector I just have to compare it to the others. For example, you find out that simiral internet companies are being traded at a price that is 15 times their projected dividends its called a Price Earning Ratio. Then, if you see that Facebook, all else being equal, is trading at 10 times its projected dividends, you could say that buying it would be at a discount. A company is worth as much as the cash flow that it will give me in the future If you think that facebook will give some dividends for a certain period of time, then you compute their present value this means finding how much you should put in a bank account today to have the same amount in the future, this can be done by dividing the amount by some interest rates. So, if you think that holding a share of a Facebook for a long period of time would give you at present value 100 and that the share of the Facebook is being traded at 70, then buy it. There is another well known method, a more quantitative one, this is the Capital Asset Pricing Model. I wont go into the details of this one, but its about looking at how a company should be priced relatively to a benchmark of other companies. Also there are a lots of factor that could affect the price of a company and make it strays away from its fundamental value crisis, interest rates, regulation, price of oil, bad management, ..... And even by applying the previous methods, the fundemantal value itself will remain speculative and you can never be sure of it. And saying that you are buying at a discount will remain an opinion.

At the money options, a necessary requirement for a straddle, have a delta of .5 There is an options strategy that uses in the money calls and puts with a delta closer to 1.0 to create an in the money strangle.

"If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?","Its important to remember what a share is. Its a tiny portion of ownership of a company. Lets pretend were talking about shares in a manufacturing company. The company has one million shares on its register. You own one thousand of them. That means that you own 11000th of the company. These shares are valued by the market at 10 per share. The company has machinery and land worth 1M. That means that for every dollar of the company you own, 10c of that value is backed by the physical assets of the company. If the company closed shop tomorrow, you could, in theory at least, get 1 back per share. The other 9 of the share value is value based on speculation about the future and current ability of the company to grow and earn income. The company is using its 1M in assets and land to produce goods which cost the company 1M in ongoing costs wages, marketing, raw cost of goods etc... to produce and make 2M per year in sales. That means the company is making a profit of 1M per annum lets assume for the sake of simplicity that this profit is after tax. Now what can the company do with its 1M profit? It can hand it out to the owners of the company which means you would get a 1 dividend each year for each share that you own or it can reinvest that money into additional equipment, product lines or something which will grow the business. The dividend would be nice, but if the owners bought 500k worth of new machinery and land and spent another 500k on ongoing costs and next year we would end up with a profit of 1.5M. So in ten years time, if the company paid out everything in dividends, you would have doubled your money, but they would have machines which are ten years older and would not have grown in value for that entire time. However, if they reinvested their profits, the compounding growth will have resulted in a company many times larger than it started. Eventually in practice there is a limit to the growth of most companies and it is at this limit where dividends should be being paid out. But in most cases you dont want a company to pay a dividend. Remember that dividends are taxed, meaning that the government eats into your profits today instead of in the distant future where your money will have grown much higher. Dividends are bad for long term growth, despite the rather nice feeling they give when they hit your bank account this is a simplification but is generally true. TLDR  A company that holds and reinvests its profits can become larger and grow faster making more profit in the future to eventually pay out. Do you want a 1 dividend every year for the next 10 years or do you want a 10 dividend in 5 years time instead?","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

How can I improve my credit score if I am not paying bills or rent?,An activity which can help improve your credit score and actually make you money is stoozing. Its a little complicated but can be beneficial to do. Using either a credit card which allows fee free money withdrawals from cashpoints or building up debt using your credit card gives you access to your credit amount. You then use a long term 0 balance transfer card to transfer the debt which you pay off at the minimum rate. Its 0 so no costs are associated except for the initial fee paid for the balance transfer amount. The money that would have been used to pay off the credit amount or money withdrawn from a cashpoint can then be deposited in a savings account so you are now earning interest on the credit balance. Continuing to make monthly minimum payments via direct debit will help improve your credit rating and the savings money will earn interest. it is also available if you suddenly need to pay off the 0 card,What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can I improve my credit score if I am not paying bills or rent?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why would preferred shares have less potential for capital gain compared to common stock?,"I once bought both preferred and common shares in a bankrupt company. It is true that those preferred shares had less potential for appreciation than the common shares. The reason is because the preferred shares were trading around 50 and had a face value of 1000. This means that if the bankruptcy proceedings ended up finding enough assets to make the preferred shares whole, then the preferred shareholders would be paid 1000 per share and no more than that. So if you bought the preferred shares at 50 and received 1000 per share for them, then you made a 1900 gain. But if the bankruptcy proceedings found enough assets to pay not just the preferred shareholders but also the common shareholders, then the common shareholders had the potential for a greater gain than the preferred shareholders. The common stock was trading around 20 cents at the time, and if enough assets were found to pay 10 per share to the common shareholders, then that would have been a 4900 gain. The preferred shares were capped by their face value, but the common shares had no limit on how high they could go.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why would preferred shares have less potential for capital gain compared to common stock?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What happens to my stocks when broker goes bankrupt?,"Here is my perception of the situation, obtained from reading Degiros Client Agreement. If Degiro shuts down, it will notify you about the fact at least one month in advance, and you will have enough time to order a transfer of your positions to a different broker. If Degiro shuts down unexpectedly, your assets will remain to be held at SPV, a separate legal entity which Degiro uses to hold the financial instruments belonging to the clients. Since SPV does nothing else but holding the assets, it is very unlikely that something bad will happen with it on its own. With some help from Degiro andor the regulator AFM you should be able to transfer your assets from SPV to a different custodian and broker and thus regain control over them. If you have a nonCustody account, you have slightly higher chances of losing your assets, because Degiro can borrow your securities held at SPV. If both the client for whom Degiro borrowed a security and Degiro itself go bankrupt at the same time, the lent security will not be returned to SPV, there will arise a shortage, which will be proportionally distributed among the accounts of the clients holding this particular security. However, then the investor compensation scheme should kick in and help you recover up to 20000 EUR of your losses.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What happens to my stocks when broker goes bankrupt?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

1099 Misc for taking care of foreign exchange students,"In general, you are allowed to deduct up to 50month per student see page 4, but only if you arent reimbursed. In your case, since you are receiving a stipend, the full 2000 will be treated as taxable income. But the question of ""is it worth it"" really depends on how much you will actually spend and also what youll get from the experience. Suppose you actually spend 1000month to host them, and if your combined tax rate is 35, youll pay 700 in additional taxes each month, but youll still profit 300 each month. If your primary motivation for hosting students is to make a profit, you could consider creating a business out of it. If you do that you will be able to deduct all of your legitimate business expenses which, in the above example, would be 1000month. Keeping with that example, you would now pay taxes on 1000 instead of 2000, which would be 350, meaning your profit would now be 650month. Increasing your profit by 350month. You will only need to keep spending records if you plan to go the business route.

Selling on eBay without PayPal?,"Its been a short while since I sold on eBay, but I had a feedback rating of about 4,500 so Ive done a lot of transactions. The trump card is, and always will be, the buyers ability to contact their credit card company and reverse the charges. PayPal has no policy to stop this even though they claim to ""vigorously defend Sellers from chargebacks"" on their website. You will lose this case 100 of the time. I dont see how that will change if you have your own terminal. The Buyer can still reverse the charges. Since you know the card number maybe you can contact his credit card company but its probably not going to do much. Ive found PayPal is more Seller friendly in terms of PayPal claims. For example, the customer has a duty to pay postage to return the product and thats a cost for him. You also have things like online tracking which shows delivery and PayPal has an IP log to see where the payments are coming from. That helped me when a buyer claimed that someone else made the payment. Because people often break into someones house and make PayPal payments for them....heh. You really just need to use PayPal.

Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it?,"The government could actually do either one to expand the money supply as necessary to keep up with rising productivity  an increased labor supply.

If the money supply were left in their hands, we would end up with a shrinking money supply and rapid deflation.

I carelessly invested in a stock on a spike near the peak price.

Without a crystal ball, such worth may generally only be determined retrospectively, but even though its generally not possible to know the precise worth of a stock in time for such information to be useful, it has a level of worth which is absolute and notunlikely market priceis generally unaffected by people buying and selling the stock except insofar as activities in company stock affect a companys ability to do business. If a particular share of stock is worth 10 by the above measure, but Joe sells it to Larry for 8, that means Joe gives Larry 2. If Larry sells it to Fred 12, Fred gives Larry 2. The only way Fred can come out ahead is if he finds someone else to give him 2 or more. If Fred can sell it to Adam for 13, then Adam will give Fred 3, leaving Fred 1 better off than he would be if he hadnt bought the stock, but Adam will be 3 worse off. The key point is that if you sell something for less than its worth, or buy something for more that its worth, you give money away.

Should I finance a new home theater at 0 even though I have the cash for it?,"I think so. I am doing this with our furniture. It doesnt cost me any more money to pay right now than it will to pay over the course of 3 years, and I can earn interest on the money I didnt spend. But know this they arent offering 0, they are deferring interest for 3 years. If you pay it off before then great, if you dont you will owe all the accumulated interest. The key with these is that you always pay it, and on time. Miss a payment and you get hosed. If you dont pay on time you will owe the interest that is being deferred. They will also be financing this through a third party like a major bank and that company is now ""doing business with you"" which means in the US they can call you and solicit new services. I am willing to deal with those trade offs though, plus, as you say, you can always pay it off. WHY THEY DO IT what is in it for them... A friend of mine works for a major bank that often finances these deals here is how they work. Basically, banks do this to generate leads for their divisions that do cold calls. If you are a high credit, high income customer you go to a classic bank and request cash, if you are building credit or have bad credit, you go to a ""financial services"" branch.

"How is it possible that a preauth sticks to a credit card for 30 days, even though the goods have already been delivered?","This is not a normal occurrence, and you have every right to be annoyed, but the technical way it usually happens goes like this What can happen is when the merchant incorrectly completes the transaction without referencing the preauthorization transaction. The bank effectively doesnt ""know"" this is the same transaction, so they process it the same way they process any other purchase, and it has no effect on the preauthorization and related heldpending transaction. As far as the bank knows, you purchased a second set of blinds in the store for 200 and are still waiting on the first order to come in, they have no idea the store screwed up. The reason this is possible is the purpose of the preauth in the first place is that it is a contractual agreement between the bank credit card and the merchant that the funds are available, will be available except under rare special circumstances, and thus they can go ahead and process the order. This lets the merchant be secure in the knowledge that they can collect their payment, but you arent paying interest or monthly payments on something you havent even gotten yet! This system works reasonably well for everyone  right up until someone screws up and fails to properly release a hold, makes a second transaction instead of properly referencing the first one, or the bank screws up their system and fails to correctly match referenced preauthorization codes to purchases. The problem is that this should not be a normal occurrence, and the people you are speaking with to try to sort out the issue often do not have the authority or knowledge necessary to properly fix the issue, or its such a hassle for them that they hope you just go away and time fixes the issue on its own. The only surefire solution to this is make sure you have so much extra credit line that this doesnt effect you and you can safely let it time out on its own, or stop doing business with this combination of merchantpayment that creates the problem. Back when my credit limits were being pushed, I would never pay at gas pumps because their hold polices were so weird and unpredictable, and I would only prepay inside or with cash to avoid the holds.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How is it possible that a preauth sticks to a credit card for 30 days, even though the goods have already been delivered?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is compounding interest on investments a myth?,"The SP 500 index from 1974 to present certainly looks exponential to me 1974 is the earliest data Google has. If you read Jeremy Siegels book there are 200 year stock graphs and the exponential nature of returns on stocks is even more evident. This graph only shows the index value and does not include the dividends that the index has been paying all these years. There is no doubt stocks have grown exponentially aka have grown with compound interest for the past several decades and compounded returns is definitely not a ""myth"". The CAGR on the SP 500 index from 1974 to present has been 7.54 1,783  97.27  1  40  1 Here is another way to think about compounded investment growth when you use cash flow from investments dividends, capital gains to purchase more investments with a positive growth rate, the investment portfolio will grow exponentially. If you own a 100 stock that pays 10 dividends per year and spend the dividends every year without reinvesting them, then the investment portfolio will still be worth 100 after 40 years.

What is the tax levied against stock portion cashed out of 401k?,"Withdrawals from a traditional 401k plan are always treated as cash income and the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, even if the money was held in stocks within the 401k plan and the amount withdrawn is equal to whatever capital gains you made by selling the stock within the 401k plan. If your plan permits you to take the distribution as stock shares transferred to your taxable brokerage account, then, for tax purposes, it is treated as if you took a distribution of cash equal to the market price of the shares as of the day of the distribution and promptly bought the same number of shares in your brokerage account. And yes, if the 401k plan assets in your exemployers plan consists solely of pretax contributions and the earnings thereon, then the entire distribution is ordinary taxable income regardless of whether you sold the stock within the 401k plan or took a distribution of stock from the plan and promptly or after a few days sold it. The capital gains or losses if any from such a sale are, of course, outside the 401k plan and taxable accordingly. Finally, the 10 penalty for premature withdrawal from a traditional 401k will also apply if you are not 59.5 years of age or older or maybe 55 since you are separated from service, and it will be computed on the entire distribution.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

How do I calculate ownership percentage for shared home ownership?,"You and your husband are fronting all the money upfront. Im guessing this will cost you around 67,000 once closing costs and fees are included. So obviously you would be hundred percent owners at the beginning. Youll then pay 31 of the mortgage and have your sister pay the remaining 69. This puts your total investment at the end at 67k  74.4k  31 of interest accrued, and your sisters total investment at 165.6k69 of interest accrued. If you hold the full length of the mortgage, your sister will have invested much more than you assuming 30 year fixed rate, and 3.75, shed pay 116.6k in interest as opposed to your 49.6k She will have spent 282.2k and yall will have spent 191k. However if you sell early, your percentage could be much higher. These calculations dont take into account the opportunity cost of fronting all the cash. It could be earning you more in the stock market or in a different investment property. Liability also could be an issue in the case of her not being able to pay. The bank can still come after you for the whole amount. Lastly and most importantly, this also doesnt include the fact that she will be living there and yall will not. What kind of rent would she be paying to live in a similar home? If it is more than 1400, you will basically be subsidizing her living, as well as tying up funds, and increasing your risk exposure.

How does investment into a private company work?,"To me this sounds like a transaction, where E already owns a company worth 400k and can therefore pocket the money from D and give D 25 of the profits every year. There is nothing objective like a piece of paper that states the company is worth 400K. It is all about perceived value. Some investors may think it is worth something because of some knowledge they may have. Heck, the company could be worth nothing but the investor could have some sentimental value associated to it. So is it actually the case that Es company is worth 400k only AFTER the transaction? It is worth what someone pays for it when they pay for it. I repeat the 400K valuation is subjective. In return the investor is getting 25 ownership of the product or company. The idea is that when someone has ownership, they have a vested interest in it being successful. In that case, the investor will do whatever heshe can to improve the chances of success in addition to supplying the 100K capital. For instance, the investor will leverage their network or perhaps put more money into it in the future. Is the 100k added to the balance sheet as cash? Perhaps. It is an asset that may later be used to fund inventory for instance. ... and would the other 300k be listed as an IP asset? No. See what I said about the valuation just being perception.

The life cycle of money,"Ill answer but avoiding discussion of M1, M2 etc, too pedantic. I dont believe you are asking about the lifetime of either coins or paper money. I think you are referencing the fractional reserve system, and how a good portion of the total money supply is created by the banks lending out their deposits in effect creating money. My answer to you is that if all loans were simply paid off, no mortgages, no car loans, etc, the total money in the system would collapse to some reasonable fraction of what it is today, 10 or a bit less. This comes from the fact that the reserve requirement for most large banks is 10. Im referencing money, but not bills or coins. Think about what you make in a year. How much do you touch as paper money? For my wife and me, its no more than a few percent. Most goes from a direct deposit to online payments.

Is there such a thing as stock insurance?,"First off, the jargon you are looking for is a hedge. A hedge is ""an investment position intended to offset potential lossesgains that may be incurred by a companion investment"" httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiHedgefinance The other answers which point out that put options are frequently used as a hedge are correct. However there are other hedging instruments used by financial professionals to mitigate risk. For example, suppose you would really prefer that Foo Corporation not go bankrupt  perhaps because they own you money because youre a bondholder or perhaps because you own them because youre a stockholder, or maybe you have some other reason for wanting Foo Corp to do well. To mitigate the risk of loss due to bankruptcy of Foo Corp you can buy a Credit Default Swap httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCreditdefaultswap. A CDS is essentially a bet that pays off if Foo Corp goes bankrupt, just as insurance on your house is a bet that pays off if your house burns down. Finally, dont ever forget that all insurance is not just a bet that the bad thing youre insuring against is going to happen, it is also a bet that the insurer is going to pay you if that happens.

Comparison between buying a stock and selling a naked put,"Yes, of course there have been studies on this. This is no more than a question about whether the options are properly priced. If properly priced, then your strategy will not make money on average before transaction costs and will lose once transaction costs are included. If you could make money using your strategy, on average, then the market should  and generally will  make an adjustment in the option price to compensate. The most famous studies on this were conducted by Black and Scholes and then by Merton. This work won the Nobel Prize in 1995. Although the BlackScholes or BlackScholesMerton equation is so well known now that people may forget it, they didnt just sit down one day and write and equation that they thought was cool. They actually derived the equation based on market factors. Beyond this ""pioneering"" work, youve got at least two branches of study. Academics have continued to study option pricing, including but not limited to revisions to the original BlackScholes model, and hedge funds  large trading house have ""quants"" looking at this stuff all of the time. The former, you could look up if you want. The latter will never see the light of day because its proprietary.

These are common mantras for long term investment mentality. 58 years is plenty of time  Id call it ""mediumterm"". As you get closer to your goals 23 years out you should start slowly moving money out of your index fund and start dollar cost averaging out into cash or shortterm bonds but thats another question. Keep putting money in, wait, and sell high. If its not high, wait another year or two to buy the house.

Equation to determine if a stock is oversold and by how much?,"To my knowledge, theres no universal equation, so this could vary by individualcompany. The equation I use outside of sentiment measurement is the below  which carries its own risks This equations assumes two key points Anything over 1.2 is considered oversold if those two conditions apply. The reason for the bear market is that thats the time stocks generally go on ""sale"" and if a company has a solid balance sheet, even in a downturn, while their profit may decrease some, a value over 1.2 could indicate the company is oversold. An example of this is Warren Buffetts investment in Wells Fargo in 2009 around March when WFC hit approximately 79 a share. Although the banking world was experiencing a crisis, Buffett saw that WFC still had a solid balance sheet, even with a decrease in profit. The missing logic with many investors was a decrease in profits  if you look at the per capita income figures, Americans lost some income, but not near enough to justify the stock falling 50 from its high when evaluating its business and balance sheet. The market quickly caught this too  within two months, WFC was almost at 30 a share. As an interesting side note on this, WFC now pays 1.20 dividend a year. A person who bought it at 7 a share is receiving a yield of 17 on their 7 a share investment. Still, this equation is not without its risks. A company may have a solid balance sheet, but end up borrowing more money while losing a ton of profit, which the investor finds out about adhoc seen this happen several times. Suddenly, what ""appeared"" to be a good sale, turns into a person buying a penny with a dollar. This is why, to my knowledge, no universal equation applies, as if one did exist, every hedge fund, mutual fund, etc would be using it. One final note with robotraders becoming more common, Im not sure well see this type of opportunity again. 2009 offered some great deals, but a robotrader could easily be built with the above equation or a similar one, meaning that as soon as we had that type of environment, all stocks fitting that scenario would be bought, pushing up their PEs. Some companies might be willing to take an ""all risk"" if they assess that this equation works for more than n of companies especially if that n returns an m that outweighs the loss. The only advantage that a small investor might have is that these large companies with robotraders are overleveraged in bad investments and with a decline, they cant make the good investments until its too late. Remember, the equation ultimately assumes a personcompany has free cash to use it this was also a problem for many large investment firms in 2009  they were overleveraged in bad debt.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Equation to determine if a stock is oversold and by how much?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What are the risks of Dividendyielding stocks?,"Yep, there just is no free lunch. So called high dividend stocks are usually from companies that have stable cash flows but relatively little or moderate growth potential. Utility companies come to mind, lets take telecommunications as an example. Such stocks, usually, indeed are considered more conservative. In a bull market, they wont make high jumps, and in a bear market they shouldnt experience deep falls. I mean, just because the stock market fell by 10, youre not going to stop using your phone. The stock might suffer a bit but the divided is still yielding you the same. However, fundamental data can have a significant impact. Lets say a recession hits the country of the telco. People might not get the newest iPhone and lock in to an expensive contract anymore, they might use cheaper forms of communication, they might stop paying bills, go bankrupt etc. This will have a severe impact on the companys cash flow and thus hit the stock in a double whammy One, the dividend is gone. Two, the price will fall even further. There are basically two scenarios after that. Either the recession is temporary and your stock became a regular growth stock that at some point might bounce back and reestablish at the previous levels. Or the economy has contracted permanently but regained stability in which case you will again have a stock with a high dividend yield but based on a lower price.

"What exactly is a bad, standard, or good annual raise? If I am told a hard percentage and dont get it, should I look elsewhere?","Keep in mind that unless you have a contract that says you get a certain amount of raise every year, the employer is not required to give you any raise. The quality of a raise is too subjective for anyone to tell you how to judge it. You either get a raise you can live with, it makes you contenthappy, and you continue working there, or you get a raise that does not satisfy you, and you jump ship to get more money. Some most? employers know that raises can be the tipping point for employees deciding to leave. If you consistently receive raises greater than inflation rate, the message is that the employer values you. If the opposite, they value you enough to continue your employment, but are willing to replace you if you decide to leave. Key thing here is there are three ways of getting increased pay with your current employer. Cost of living or annual raise is the one that we are discussing. Merit based raises are a second way. If you think you deserve a raise, due to loyal consistent contribution, or contributing above your duty, or for whatever reason, then ask for a raise. The third way is to be promoted or transferred to a higher paying position. Often times, you should also make your case to your supervisor why you should have the new position, similar to asking for a merit raise.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What exactly is a bad, standard, or good annual raise?

Are ExchangeTraded Funds ETFs less safe than regular mutual funds?,"If anything, the price of an ETF is more tightly coupled to the underlying holdings or assets than a mutual fund, because of the independent creationdestruction mechanism. With a mutual fund, the price is generally set once at the end of each day, and the mutual fund manager has to deal with investments and redemptions at that price. By the time they get to buying or selling the underlying assets, the market may have moved or they may even move the market with those transactions. With an ETF, investment and redemption is handled by independent ""authorized participants"". They can create new units of the ETF by buying up the underlying assets and delivering them to the ETF manager, and vice versa they can cancel units by requesting the underlying assets from the ETF manager. ETFs trade intraday i.e. at any time during trading hours and any time the price diverges too far from the underlying assets, one of the authorized participants has an incentive to make a small profit by creating or destroying units of the ETF, also intraday.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are ExchangeTraded Funds ETFs less safe than regular mutual funds?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

At what point is it most advantageous to cease depositing into a 401k?,"The only time to stop saving money for retirement is when you have enough money to retire tomorrow. Not all of your ""retirement savings"" need to be in a 401k, it is just better if you can. Be sure to get as much as you can from the employer matching program. Unfortunately some employer matching programs discourage you from putting in too much. Ive been able to max out the 401k contribution a number of times, which helps. Remember you are likely to live to 100, so you better save enough to live that long. I dont trust social security to be there. I recommend saving so that you end up with ""enough to be comfortable""  this is usually about 25x your current income  PLUS inflation between now and when you plan to retire age 62 is a good target. It is worth knowing your ""retirement savings number"". If you are making 100K per year now, you need to target 2.5M  PLUS allowance for inflation between now and when you plan to retire. This usually means you need to also arrange to make more money as well as save as much as you can and to use passive investing.

US citizen transferring money to Indian fiance to buy property,"A. Kindly avoid taking dollars in form of cash to india unless and until it is an emergency. Once the dollar value is in excess of 10,000, you need to declare the same with Indian customs at the destination. Even though it is not a cumbersome procedure, why unnecessarily undergo all sort of documentation and most importantly at all security checks, you will be asked questions on dollars and you need to keep answering. Finally safety issue is always there during the journey. B.There is no Tax on the amount you declare. You can bring in any amount. All you need is to declare the same. C. It is always better to do a wire transfer. D. Any transfer in excess of 14,000 from US, will atract gift tax as per IRS guidelines. You need to declare the same while filing your Income Tax in US and pay the gift tax accordingly. E. Once your fiance receives the money , any amount in excess of Rs 50,000 would be treated as individual income and he has to show the same under Income from other sources while filing the taxes. Taxes will be as per the slab he falls under. F.Only for blood relatives , this limit of 50,000 does not apply. G. Reg the Loan option, suggest do not opt for the same. Incase you want to go ahead, then pl ensure that you fully comply with IRS rules on Loans made to a foreign person from a US citizen or resident. The person lending the money must report the interest payment as income on his or her yearly tax return provided the loan has interest element. No deduction is allowed if the proceeds are used for personal or nonbusiness purposes.In the case of nointerest loans, most people believe there is no taxable income because no interest is paid. The IRS views this seriously and the tax rules are astonishingly complex when it comes to nointerest loans. Even though no interest is paid to the lender, the IRS will treat the transaction as if the borrower paid interest at the applicable federal rate to the lender and the lender subsequently gifted the interest back to the borrower.The lender is taxed on the imaginary interest income and, depending on the amount, may also be liable for gift tax on the imaginary payment made back to the borrower.

US Bank placing a hold on funds from my paycheck deposit Why does that make sense?,"First, congratulations on the paycheck!  On the holds Is it possible that by allowing your account balance to go negative into overdraft that you triggered such treatment of your account? Perhaps the bank is being more cautious with your account since that happened. Just how long did you have their 150 on hold?  Or, perhaps its not you specifically but the bank is being more cautious due to credit conditions that have been prevalent these last years. Consider allowing you to cash a check immediately  when it technically hasnt cleared yet  is a form of credit. Maybe it isnt you they dont trust well enough yet, but the company that issued the check? Checks bounce, and not by fault of the depositor. I once had a new account, years ago, and discovered a 5 day hold on deposits. The irony was it was a check drawn on the same bank! I called my banker and asked about it  and suggested Id take my business back to my old bank. I was in the process of applying for a mortgage with the new bank. Holds were removed. But you may have some trouble with the ""Ill walk"" technique given the climate and your recent overdraft situation and no leverage  or if you do have some leverage, consider using it. But before you assume anything, I would, as JohnFx suggested, ask your bank about it. Pay your branch a visit in person and talk to the manager. Phone calls to customer service may be less successful. If its not a big issue and more a minor technical policy one, the bank may remove the holds. If they wont, the manager ought to tell you why, and what you can do to solve it eventually.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: US Bank placing a hold on funds from my paycheck deposit Why does that make sense?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Buying insurance extended warranty or guarantee on everyday goods  appliances?,"IMO its usually not worth it and heres why. Theres a statistical distribution of how likely a unit may fail depending on its age. Probability is high for a short period after the unit comes into use because there are parts that were not thoroughly tested and manufacturing defects. Then all those defective parts fail and get replaces and the unit likely functions without faults for years. Then it reaches it lifetime end and again probability becomes much higher  parts wear out and start failing one by one. Every unit comes with a manufacturer warranty of one to two years already and that warranty will likely cover any defect causes by materials and manufacturing defects  the period when fault probability is initially high. ""Extended warranty"" only covers the unit for twotofive years and most units have lifetime of about ten years. This means that the ""extended warranty"" is in effect when it is least useful.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Buying insurance extended warranty or guarantee on everyday goods  appliances?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Facebook buying WhatsApp for 19 Billion. How are existing shareholders affected?,"Its a dilution of the ownership the public used to own x of Facebook and now they own less than x of the bigger Facebook that incorporates Whatsapp assuming that Whatsapp was completely private before. Logically, the 15 billion is allocated proportionately between the existing stockholders x of it for the general public, y for Mark Zuckerberg, etc. However it doesnt really make sense to think of it that way unless Whatsapp is actually worthless. Whats important are the proportions. Suppose that the newly issued shares correspond to 25 of the previous share capital. Then previously the general public owned x out of 100, and now they own x out of 125, i.e. 0.8x of the new share capital. Whether the actual value of those stocks has changed depends entirely on the actual value that Whatsapp adds to the old Facebook. As Dheer says, only time will tell on that one. Apart from the financial consequences, dilution is sometimes considered important because it can mean a change in influence a significant shareholder would often be able to encourage the company to act in a certain way.

How to calculate cash loss over time?,"While it is a true loss, as youve determined, is not a cash cost, per se. A cash cost would be a decrease in cash holdings. Inflation does not take your cash balance it devalues it, so it is an accrued loss. Central banks are extremely lazy in determining inflation, so the highest resolution available at a public level is monthly. In the United States, there is a small project that tries to calculate daily inflation rates and seems to do a decent job, but unless if you are a customer of a particular financial institution, you will suffer a lag. The small project refuses to make the data public in real time or even allow outside analysis. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics is responsible for consumer inflation statistics. The methodology is not readily available, but considering the name, it is most likely an inferior Laspeyres index instead of the optimal Fisher index as it is in the US. To calculate the accrued cost due to inflation, simply multiply the amount of money held by the price index value at the beginning of the time held and divide by the price index value at the end of the time held. For example, to determine the amount of value lost since March 2014, multiply the money held by the price index value for March 2014 and divide by June 2014.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How to calculate cash loss over time?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Loan holder wants a check from the insurance company that I already cashed and used to repair my car,"What would happen if you was to cash a check, didnt realize it was to you and your finance company, take it to a local business that has a money center, they cash the check without even having you sign let alone having the finance companies endorsement on it . The money cleared my account like a couple months ago and it was just brought up now .. ? The reason why the check was made out the owner and the lender is to make sure the repairs were done on the car. The lender wants to make sure that their investment is protected. For example you get a six year loan on a new car. In the second year you get hit by another driver. The damage estimate is 1,000, and you decide it doesnt look that bad, so you decide to skip the repair and spend the money on paying off debts. What you dont know is that if they had done the repair they would have found hidden damage and the repair would have cost 3,000 and would have been covered by the other persons insurance. Jump ahead 2 years, the rust from the skipped repair causes other issues. Now it will cost 5,000 to fix. The insurance wont cover it, and now a car with an outstanding loan balance of 4,000 and a value of 10,000 if the damage didnt exist needs 5,000 to fix. The lender wants the repairs done. They would have not signed the check before seeing the proof the repairs were done to their satisfaction. But because the check was cashed without their involvement they will be looking for a detailed receipt showing that all the work was done. They may require that the repair be done at a certified repair shop with manufacturer parts.

Is it ever logical to not deposit to a matched 401k account?,"The original question was aimed at early payment on a student loan at 6. Lets look at some numbers. Note, the actual numbers were much lower, Ive increased the debt to a level thats more typical, as well as more likely to keep the borrower worried, and ""up at night."" On a 50K loan, we see 2 potential payoffs. A 6 year accelerated payoff which requires 273.54 extra per month, and the original payoff, with a payment of 555.10. Next, I show the 6 year balance on the original loan terms, 23,636.44 which we would need to exceed in the 401k to consider we made the right choice. The last section reflects the 401k balance with different rates of return. I purposely offer a wide range of returns. Even if we had another lost decade averaging 1yr, the 401k balance is more than 50 higher than the current loan debt. At a more reasonable 6 average, its double. Note The 273.54 deposit should really be adjusted, adding 33 if one is in the 25 bracket, or 17.6 if 15 bracket. That opens the can of worms at withdrawal. But let me add, I coerced my sister to deposit to the match, while married and a 25er. Divorced, and disabled, her withdrawals are penalty free, and 10K is tax free due to STD deduction and exemption. Note The chart and text above have been edited at the request of a member comment. What about an 18 credit card? Glad you asked  The same 50K debt. Its tough to imagine a worse situation. You budgeted and can afford 901, because thats the number for a 10 year payoff. Your spouse says she can grab a extra shift and add 239mo to the plan, because that the number to get to a 6 year payoff. The balance after 6 years if we stick to the 10 year plan? 30,669.82. The 401k balances at varying rates of return again appear above. A bit less dramatic, as that 18 is tough, but even at a negative return the 401k is still ahead. You are welcome to run the numbers, adjust deposits for your tax rate and same for withdrawals. Youll see 1 is still about breakeven. To be fair, there are a number of variables, debt owed, original time for loan to be paid, rate of loan, rate of return assumed on the 401k, amount of potential extra payment, and the 2 tax rates, going in, coming out. Combine a horrific loan rate the 18 with a longer payback 15 years and you can contrive a scenario where, in fact, even the matched funds have trouble keeping up. Im not judging, but I believe its fair to say that if one cant find a budget that allows them to pay their 18 debt over a 10 year period, they need more help that we can offer here. Im only offering the math that shows the power of the matched deposit. From a comment below, the one warning Id offer is regarding vesting. The matched funds may not be yours immediately. Companies are allowed to have a vesting schedule which means your right to this money may be tiered, at say, 20year from year 26, for example. Its a good idea to check how your plan handles this. On further reflection, the comments of David Wallace need to be understood. At zero return, the matched money will lag the 18 payment after 4 years. The reason my chart doesnt reflect that is the match from the deposits younger than 4 years is still making up for that potential loss. Id maintain my advice, to grab the match regardless, as there are other factors involved, the more likely return of 8, the tax differential should one lose their job, and the hope that one would get their act together and pay the debt off faster.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Why is volatility in a positive direction clubbed in the same risk category as volatility in a negative direction?,"Mostly, when an equitys price rises, its statistical and implied volatilities fall and vice versa. The reason why is a mathematical phenomenon mixed with the reality that a unceasingly falling asset price will soon not exist, skewing the results with survivorship bias. Since volatility is standard deviation of price indexes, a security that changes in price by the same amount every day will have lower volatility, so a rising price will have lower implied volatility because its mostly experiencing positive daily price change while a recently falling price will have higher volatility because factored together with the positive price changes, the negative price changes will widen the standard deviation of the securities price index. Quantitatively, any change, in or out of ones favor, is a risk because change is uncertain, and any uncertainty is a risk. This quantitative interpretation while valid runs almost totally counter to the value opinion, that a lower price relative to value is a lower risk than a higher price relative to value, but both have their place in time. Over long time periods, its best to use the value interpretation, quantitative for shorter.

Why exercise ISOQSO early?,"You are thinking about it this way ""The longer I wait to exericse, the more knowledge and information Ill have, thus the more confidence I can have that Ill be able to sell at a profit, minimizing risk. If I exercise early and still have to wait, there may never be a chance I can sell at a profit, and Ill have lost the money I paid to exercise and any tax I had to pay when I exercised."" All of that is true. But if you exercise early The fair market value of the stock will probably be lower, so you may pay less income tax when you exercise. This depends on your tax situation. Currently, ISO exercises affect your AMT. If the company goes through a phase where the value is unusually high, youll be able to sell and still get the tax benefits because you exercised earlier. You avoid the nightmare scenario where you leave the company voluntarily or not and cant afford to exercise your options because of the tax implications. In many realistic cases, exercising earlier means less risk. Imagine if youre working at a company that is privately held and you expect to be there for another year or so. You are very optimistic about the company, but not sure when it will IPO or get acquired and that may be several years off. The fair market value of the stock is low now, but may be much higher in a year. In this case, it makes a lot of sense to exercise now. The cost is low because the fair market value is low so it wont result in a huge tax bill. And then when you leave in a year, you wont have to choose between forfeiting your options or borrowing money to pay the much higher taxes due to exercise them then.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why exercise ISOQSO early?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How do top investors pull out 20 ROI?,"Its called leverage. Heres an example from real estate. The underlying appreciation on a house in certain parts of America is something like 7 a year. So if you bought the house ""all cash,"" your return would be something like 7 a year. Actually, a little more, because of the rent you would be collecting, or saving, if you were the ""renter."" Suppose you buy the same house, 20 down, 80 mortgage. The rent pays for your mortgage, taxes, insurance, etc. like it is supposed to. The house goes up the same 7 each year. But now your rate of return is 35, that is 720 your down payment. You get the whole appreciation but put up only 20 of the money.

How are they earning money in the movie Trading Places?,"They are not selling stocks. They are selling OJ futures contracts. Selling a futures contract at 142 gives the buyer the right to buy a fixed number of pounds of orange juice concentrate ""OJ"" on a future date at 142 cents per pound. The seller has an obligation to suppy that fixed number of pounds of OJ to the buyer on the future date for 142 cents per pound. When the seller turns around and buys future contracts at 29, the seller gets the right to buy OJ on a future date at 29. This ""zeros his position""  meaning hes guaranteed himself the ability to deliver the pounds of OJ he was obligated to supply when he sold futures contracts at 142. And since hell only have to pay 29 cents per pound, and hell be selling the OJ for 142 per pound, hell walk away with 113 cents of profit for every pound sold.

"If I have a home loan preapproval letter for x, can the seller know this without me explicitely telling them?","The seller has a legitimate desire to know of your preapproval. I have two current anecdotes on this issue. As a realtor helping a client buy a home, I worked closely with buyers bank, and got a preapproval for the amount we were offering. When there was a counteroffer, and we were going to raise the price, the bank upped the numbers on the preapproval letter. I have a property of my own I am trying to sell. I had a negotiated price, PS, but no preapproval from the buyer. The buyer of his home couldnt get a mortgage, and so far, the deal has fallen through. I agree with you, you dont want to signal you can afford more, nor show any emotion about how great that house is.

Is it beneficial to convert noninvestment real estate to rental if I need to make major repairs? USAMissouri,"I dont have a direct answer for you, but here are some other things you might consider to help you decide on a course of action in addition to Joes note about consulting a CPA... Get a couple contractors out to look the place over and give you some quotes on the work needed, most will do so for free, or a nominal fee. Everything about the extent and cost of repairs is complete guess work until you have some firm numbers. You might also consider getting an uptodate appraisal, particularly if you can find someone willing to give you an ""after improvements"" estimate as well. The housing market has fluctuated a bunch in the last couple years, your current value may have shifted significantly from where you think it is if you havent done one recently. You will definitely have to pay for this service, I would estimate around 500 based on one I got in St Louis a few months ago. You might also consider reaching out to a local property management company to find out where they think you would fall in the scope of the current rental market and what improvements they would recommend. You will probably want to be onsite to talk to any of the above people about the work they are proposing, and your intended goals, so figure some travel costs and time into your evaluation. As one of your noted concerns was the state of the roof, I can tell you that in St Louis County, and the spec sheet for most shingle manufacturers, you are limited to two layers of shingles, then the roof is supposed to be stripped and redone from the bare wood. Personally, I wont even do the second layer, I always go to bare wood and start over, if for no other reason than it gives me an opportunity to inspect the deck and deal with any minor problem areas before they become big problems. I dont know Greene County to know what the local code may be like, but odds are high that the shingle manufacture would not honor any warranty with this installation. Another potential gotcha that may be lurking out there is your ex may still have a lingering claim to the home if you go to sell it. I dont know the rules in Missouri off hand, but where I grew up with family in the real estate and title insurance businesses there was a law regarding homestead rights. If a spouse spent even one night in a property, they had an interest in it and an explicit waiver had to be signed to release said interest. Review your divorce settlement andor contact your attorney to confirm your status in this regard. Also consider the potential of refinancing your mortgage to either reduce the payment, or get funds for the improvementsrepairs. Final note, I understand wanting to help out a friend I have done similar things more times than I can count, but seriously look at the situation and see if you cant get the rent or other compensation up to the level of the mortgage at least. You mentioned that you have belongings still on the property, what would a storage unit for said items cost? In terms of juggling the numbers you could potentially use that value as justification to adjust the friends rent as a caretaker fee without any issue. Verify with your CPA Talk to the friend and see if there are other parts of the job they would be willing and able to take on as consideration for the reduced rent make sure you have at least a simple contract on any such agreement. Or if none of the above are sufficient to balance the numbers, see if they would be willing to take on an actual room mate to help make up the difference.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is it beneficial to convert noninvestment real estate to rental if I need to make major repairs?

Will I be able to purchase land?,"Here are some important things to think about. Alan and Denise Fields discuss them in more detail in Your New House. Permanent work. Where do you want to live? Are there suitable jobs nearby? How much do they pay? Emergency fund. Banks care that you have ""reserves"" andor an unsecured line of credit in case you have a run of bad luck. This also helps with float the large expenses when closing a loan. Personal line of credit. Who are you building for? If you are not married, then you should consider whether building a home makes that easier, or harder. If you hope to have kids, you should consider whether your home will make it easier to have kids, or harder. If you are married or seriously considering it, make sure that your spouse helps with the shopping, and is in agreement on the priorities and choices. If you are not married, then what will you do ifwhen you get married? Will you sell? expand? build another house on the same lot? rent the home out? Total budget. How much can the lot, utilities, permits, taxes, financing charges, building costs, and contingency allowance come to? Talk with a banker about how much you can afford. Talk with a buildonyourlot builder about how much house you can get for that budget. Consider a new mobile or manufactured home. But if you do choose one, ask your banker how that affects what you can borrow, and how it affects your rates and terms. Talk with a good real estate agent about how much the resale value might be. Finished lot budget. How much can you budget for the lot, utilities, permits required to get zoning approval, fees, interest, and taxes before you start construction? Down payment. It sounds like you have a plan for this. Loan underwriting. Talk with a good bank loan officer about what their expectations are. Ask about the ""frontend"" and ""backend"" DebtToIncome ratios. In Oregon, I recommend Washington Federal for lot loans and construction loans. They keep all of their loans, and service the loans themselves. They use appraisers who are specially trained in evaluating new home construction. Their appraisers tend to appraise a bit low, but not ridiculously low like the incompetent appraisers used by some other banks in the area. I know two banks with lots of Oregon branches that use an appraiser who ignores 40 of the finished, heated area of some tobebuilt homes. Avoid any institution including USAA and NavyFed that outsources their lending to PHH. Lot loan. In Oregon, Washington Federal offers lot loans with 30 down payments, 20year amortization, and one point, on approved credit. The interest rate can be a fixed rate, but is typically a few percentage points per year higher than for a mortgage secured by a permanent house. If you have the financial wherewithal to start building within two years, Washington Federal also offers shortterm lot loans. Ask about the costs of appraisals, points, and recording fees. Rent. How much will it cost to rent a place to live, between when you move back to Oregon, and when your new home is ready to move into? Commute. How much time will it take to get from your new home to work? How much will it cost? E.g., car ownership, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, taxes, fuel? If public transportation is an option, how much will it cost? Lot availability. How many are there to choose from? Can you talk a farmer into selling off a chunk of land? Can you homestead government land? How much does a lot cost? Is it worth getting a double lot or an extra large lot? Utilities. Do you want to live off the grid? Are you willing to make the choices needed to do that? E.g., well, generator, septic system, satellite TV and telephony, fuel storage If not, how much will it cost to connect to such systems? For practical purposes, subtract twice the value of these installation costs from the cost of a finished lot, when comparing lot deals. Easements. These provide access to your property, access for others through your property, and affect your rights. Utility companies often ask for far more rights than they need. Until you sign on the dotted line, you can negotiate them down to just what they need. Talk to a good real estate attorney. Zoning. How much will you be allowed to build? In terms of home square footage, garage square footage, roof area, and impermeable surfaces. How can the home be used? As a business, as a farm, how many unrelated people can live there, etc. What setbacks are required? How tall can the buildings be? Are there setbacks from streams, swamps, ponds, wetlands, or steep slopes? Choosing a builder. For construction loans, banks want builders who will build what is agreed upon, in a timely fashion. If you want to build your own house, talk to your loan officer about what the bank expects in a builder. Plansets and permits. The construction loan process. If you hire a general contractor, and if you have difficulties with the contractor, you might be forced to refuse to accept some work as being complete. A good bank will back you up. Ask about points, appraisal charges, and inspection fees. Insurance during construction. Some companies have good plans  if the construction takes 12 months or less. Some but not all auto insurance companies also offer good homeowners insurance for homes under construction. Choose your auto insurance company accordingly. Property taxes. Dont forget to include them in your postconstruction budget. Homeowners insurance. Avoid properties that need flood insurance. Apply a sanity check to flood maps  some of them are unrealistic. Strongly consider earthquake insurance. Dont forget to include these costs in your postconstruction budget. Energy costs. Some jurisdictions require you to calculate how large a heating system you need. Do not trust their design temperatures  they may not allow for enough heating during a cold snap, especially if you have a heat pump. Some heat pumps work at 10F  but most lose their effectiveness between 10F and 25F. You can use these calculations, in combination with the number of ""heating degree days"" and ""cooling degree days"" at your site, to accurately estimate your energy bills. If you choose a mobile or manufactured home, calculate how much extra its energy bills will be. Home design. Here are some good sources of ideas A Pattern Language, by Christopher Alexander. Alexander emphasizes building homes and neighborhoods that can grow, and that have niches within niches within niches. The NotSoBig House, by Sarah Susanka. This book applies many Alexanders design patterns to medium and large new houses. Before the Architect. The late Ralph Pressel emphasized the importance of plywood sheathing, flashing, pocket doors, wide hallways, wide stairways, attic trusses, and opentruss or Ijoist floor systems. Lots of outlets and incandescent lighting are good too. It is possible to have too much detail in a house plan, and too much room in a house. For examples, see any of his plans.

"Why do Americans have to file taxes, even if their only source of income is from a regular job?","I think the key point thats making the other commenters misunderstand each other here is the concept of ""deductions"". I can only speak for the UK, but thats only a concept that business owners would understand in this country. For things like child credits or low income tax credits, we dont get paid them at the end of the tax year, but into our bank accounts every couple of weeks all year round. Therefore, we have nothing to ""deduct"". If we work for a company and have business expenses, then the company pays for them. If we make interest on our savings, the bank pays it for us. We make money at our jobs, and the employer works out what taxes and national insurance we owe, based on a tax code that the government works out for us annually which we can challenge. To be fair, its not like were free from bureaucracy if we want to claim these benefits. There are often lots of forms if you want child benefit or disability allowances, for instance. We just apply as soon as were eligible, rather than waiting to get a lump sum rebate. So it appears to be a very different system, and neither is inherently better than the other though Im personally glad I dont usually have to fill in a big tax return myself, which I only did one year when I was self employed. Id be interested to know, since Google has let me down, which countries use the American system, and which the British or Czech.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do Americans have to file taxes, even if their only source of income is from a regular job?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is there a good rule of thumb for how much I should have set aside as emergency cash?,"I think this varies considerably depending on your situation. Ive heard people say 6 months living expenses, and I know Suze Orman recommended bumping that to 8 months in our current economy. My husband and I have no children, lots of student loan debts, but we pay off our credit cards in full each month and are working to save up for a house. Weve talked through a few different whatif scenarios. If one of us were to lose our job, we have savings to cover the difference between our reduced income and paying the bills for 6 or 8 months while the other person regained employment. If both of us were to lose our jobs simultaneously, our savings wouldnt hold us over for more than 3 or 4 months, but if that were to happen, we would likely take advantage of the opportunity to relocate closer to our families, and possibly even move in to my parents house for a short time. With no children and no mortgage, our commitments are few, so I dont feel the need to have a very large emergency cash fund, especially with student loans to pay off. Think through a few scenarios for your life and see what you would need. Take into consideration expenses to break a rental lease, cell phone contract, or other commitments. Then, start saving toward your goal.

Pay index fund expense ratios with cash instead of fund balance,"The mutual fund is legally its own company that youre investing in, with its own expenses. Mutual fund expense ratios are a calculated value, not a promise that youll pay a certain percentage on a particular day. That is to say, at the end of their fiscal year, a fund will total up how much it spent on administration and divide it by the total assets under management to calculate what the expense ratio is for that year, and publish it in the annual report. But you cant just ""pay the fee"" for any given year. In a ""regular"" account, you certainly could look at what expenses were paid for each fund by multiplying the expense ratio by your investment, and use it in some way to figure out how much additional you want to contribute to ""make it whole"" again. But it makes about as much sense as trying to pay the commission for buying a single stock out of one checking account while paying for the share price out of another. It may help you in some sort of mental accounting of expenses, but since its all your money, and the expenses are all part of what youre paying to be able to invest, its not really doing much good since money is fungible. In a retirement account with contribution limits, it still doesnt really make sense, since any contribution from outside funds to try to pay for expense ratios would be counted as contributions like any other. Again, I guess it could somehow help you account for how much money you wanted to contribute in a year, but Im not really sure it would help you much. Some funds or brokerages do have nonexpenseratiobased fees, and in some cases you can pay for those from outside the account. And there are a couple cases where for a retirement account this lets you keep your contributions invested while paying for fees from outside funds. This may be the kind of thing that your coworker was referring to, though its hard to tell exactly from your description. Usually its best just to have investments with as low fees as possible regardless, since theyre one of the biggest drags on returns, and Id be very wary of any brokeragebased fees when there are very cheap and free mutual fund brokerages out there.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Pay index fund expense ratios with cash instead of fund balance?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Proscons of borrowing money using a mortgage loan and investing it in a lowfee index fund?,"Risk is the problem, as others have pointed out. Your fixed mortgage interest rate is for a set period of time only. Lets say your 3 might be good for five years, because thats typical of fixedrate mortages in Canada. So, what happens in five years if your investment has dropped 50 due to a prolonged bear market, and interest rates have since moved up from 3 to 8? Your investment would be underwater, and you wouldnt have enough to pay off the loan and exit the failed strategy. Rather, you might just be stuck with renewing the mortage at a rate that makes the strategy far less attractive, being more likely to lose money in the long run than to earn any. Leverage, or borrowing to invest, amplifies your risk considerably. If you invest your own money in the market, you might lose what you started with, but if you borrow to invest, you might lose much more than you started with. Theres also one very specific issue with the example investment youve proposed You would be borrowing Canadian dollars but investing in an index fund of U.S.based companies that trade in U.S. dollars. Even if the index has positive returns in U.S. dollar terms, you might end up losing money if the Canadian dollar strengthens vs. the U.S. dollar. It has happened before, multiple times.

Dad paying for my new home in cash. How can I buy the house from him?,"There are quite some options, but without additional information, I can only provide examples. Last year I had the option to buy a house, but I decided against it because in my area it is getting harder and harder every year to sell it at a reasonable price. But if I had bought a house, my mother would have lent me the money, with me paying it back to her over the years on 3 interest. So it would have been some kind of a private loan. But my mom would never have taken ownership of the house, since it was not her intention to own it in any way. Does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you? If yes, and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying, then this is an option. The second option, the one we discarded because of the additional cost, is that I could have taken a loan, paying 4.5 interest to the bank, which would then pay under 1 to my mom, and keep the rest. Banks always want to make profit, and this profit has to come from somewhere  from the difference between the interest rates. If your dad has 230k on the bank, and you owe 230k to the bank, you are better off if you keep the bank out  at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money, and you are comfortable with owing him money. my gf would never borough money from her mother, because her mother would always play the ""you are in my debt"" card  on each and every visit, and whenever she needed help in any way... So the key is What does your dad feel comfy with  and what do you feel comfy with. If possible, keep the banks out, but set up a written contract between you and your dad.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Dad paying for my new home in cash.

Shares are they really only for the richinvestors?,"I think I have a better answer for this since I have been an investor in the stock markets since a decade and most of my money is either made through investing or trading the financial markets. Yes you can start investing with as low as 50 GBP or even less. If you are talking about stocks there is no restriction on the amount of shares you can purchase the price of which can be as low as a penny. I stared investing in stocks when I was 18. With the money saved from my pocket money which was not much. But I made investments on a regular period no matter how less I could but I would make regular investments on a long term. Remember one thing, never trade stock markets always invest in it on a long term. The stock markets will give you the best return on a long term as shown on the graph below and will also save you money on commission the broker charge on every transaction. The brokers to make money for themselves will ask you to trade stocks on short term but stock market were always made to invest on a long term as Warren Buffet rightly says. And if you want to trade try commodities or forex. Forex brokers will offer you accounts with as low as 25 USD with no commissions. The commission here are all inclusive in spreads. Is this true? Can the average Joe become involved? Yes anyone who wants has an interest in the financial markets can get involved. Knowledge is the key not money. Is it worth investing 50 here and there? Or is that a laughable idea? 50 GBP is a lot. I started with a few Indian Rupees. If people laugh let them laugh. Only morons who dont understand the true concept of financial markets laugh. There are feesrules involved, is it worth the effort if you just want to see? The problem with todays generation of people is that they fear a lot. Unless you crawl you dont walk. Unless you try something you dont learn. The only difference between a successful person and a not successful person is his ability to try, failfall, get back on feet, again try untill he succeeds. I know its not instant money, but Id like to get a few shares here and there, to follow the news and see how companies do. I hear that BRIC brasil, russia, india and china is a good share to invest in Brazil India the good thing is share prices are relatively low even the commissions. Mostly ROI return on investment on a long term would almost be the same. Can anyone share their experiences? maybe best for community wiki? Always up for sharing.

Why is it important to research a stock before buying it?,"The following is only an overview and does not contain all of the indepth reasons why you should look more deeply. When you look at a stocks financials in depth you are looking for warning signs. These may warn of many things but one important thing to look for is ratio and growth rate manipulation. Using several different accounting methods it is possible to make a final report reflect a PE ratio or any other ratio that is inconsistent with the realities of the companys position. Earnings manipulation in the way that Enron in particular manipulated them is more widespread than you might think as ""earnings smoothing"" is a common way of keeping earnings in line or smooth in a recession or a boom. The reason that PE ratio looks so good could well be because professional investors have avoided the stock as there appear to be ""interesting"" but legal accounting decisions that are of concern. Another issue that you dont consider is growth. earnings may look good in the current reporting period but may have been stagnant or falling when considered over multiple periods. The low price may indicate falling revenues, earnings and market share that you would not be aware of when taking only your criteria into account. Understanding a firm will also give you an insight into how future news might affect the company. If the company has a lot of debt and market interest rates rise or fall how will that effect their debt, if another company brings out a competing product next week how will it effect the company? How will it effect their bottom line? How much do they rely on a single product line? How likely is it that their flagship product will become obsolete? How would that effect the company? Looking deeply into a companys financial statements will allow you to see any issues in their accounting practices and give you a feel for how they are preforming over time, it will also let you look into their cost of capital and investment decisions. Looking deeply into their products, company structure and how news will effect them will give you an understanding of potential issues that could threaten your investment before they occur. When looking for value you shouldnt just look at part of the value of the company you wouldnt just look at sales of a single Tshirt range at Wallmart when deciding whether to invest in them. It is exactly the same argument for why you should look at the whole of the companys state when choosing to invest rather than a few small metrics.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is it important to research a stock before buying it?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

However, when you calculate what you need to sell to meet your current cash needs make sure to include in that analysis money to pay taxes on anything you sell for a gain, or keep some invested to account for the tax money you would save by selling things for a loss.

Direct Registration System vs Brokerage Firm,"Youll need to talk to your broker about registering positions you already hold. I would personally expect this will cost you a notinsignificant fee. And I dont think youll be able to do this on any shares held in a taxadvantaged account. That said, Id recommend you go to the Investors sections of the companys website in question. This will usually tell you who the registrar of the companys stock is, and if they offer any directpurchase, or DRIP, programs. You should find out from these contacts and program details how the direct program works and what its costs are. I suspect, but have no firsthand knowledge that this will be true, that youll end up with lower costs if you just sell the shares in your brokerage, take the cash out, send the cash to the registrar and repurchase shares that way. I say this only because I know, from inheritance situations, that deregistering stock cost me a 75 fee at my brokerage, whereas transactions at the registrar were 19.95.

Is it necessary to pay tax if someone lends me money to put into my mortgage?,"I cant vouch for Australian law, but in the US there is actually a recognized mechanism for ""infamily loans"" which ensures that its all fully documented for tax purposes, including filing it as an official second mortgage. Just did that recently in my own family, which is why Im aware of it. Were required to charge at least some interest theres a minimum set, currently around 0.3, and the interest is taxable income, and it is wise to get a lawyer to draw up the paperwork there are a few services which specialize in this, charging a flat fee of about US700 if the loan is standard enough that they can handle it as fillintheblank, but outside of that its pretty painless. This can also be used as a way of shifting gift limits from year to year  if you issue a loan, and then gift the recipient with the payments each year including the payments, youve effectively spread the immediate transfer of money over multiple years of taxes. Of course it does cost you the legal paperwork and the tax in the interest which theyre still ""paying"" out of your gift, but it can be a useful tool, and its one that wasnt well known until recently.

How to change a large quantity of U.S. dollars into Euros?,"To transfer US30,000 from the USA to Europe, ask your European banker for the SWIFT transfer instructions. Typically in the USA the sending bank needs a SWIFT code and an account number, the name and address of the recipient, and the amount to transfer. A change of currency can be made as part of the transfer. The typical fee to do this is under US100 and the time, under 2 days. But you should ask or have the sender ask the bank in the USA about the fees. In addition to the fee the bank may try to make a profit on the change of currency. This might be 12. If you were going to do this many times, one way to go about it is to open an account at Interactive Brokers, which does business in various countries. They have a foreign exchange facility whereby you can deposit various currencies into your account, and they stay in that currency. You can then trade the currencies at market rates when you wish. They are also a stock broker and you can also trade on the various exchanges in different countries. I would say, though, they they mostly want customers already experienced with trading. I do not know if they will allow someone other than you to pay money into your account. Trading companies based in the USA do not like to be in the position of collecting on cheques owed to you, that is more the business of banks. Large banks in the USA with physical locations charge monthly fees of 10mo or more that might be waived if you leave money on deposit. Online banks have significantly lower fees. All US banks are required to follow US antiterrorist and anticrime regulations and will tend to expect a USA address and identity documents to open an account with normal customers. A good international bank in Europe can also do many of these same sorts of things for you. Ive had an account with Fortis. They were ok, there were no monthly fees but there were fees for transactions. In some countries I understand the post even runs a bank. Paypal can be a possibility, but fees can be high 3 for transfers, and even higher commissions for currency change.

What are the possible metrics for evaluating annual performance of a portfolio?,"The Investopedia article you linked to is a good start. Its key takeaway is that you should always consider riskadjusted return when evaluating your portfolio. In general, investors seeking a higher level of return must face a higher likelihood of taking a loss risk. Different types of stocks large vs small international vs US different industry sectors have different levels of historical risk and return. Not to mention stocks vs bonds or other financial instruments... So, its key to make an applestoapples comparison against an appropriate benchmark. A benchmark will tell you how your portfolio is doing versus a comparable portfolio. An index, such as the SP 500, is often used, because it tells you how your portfolio is doing compared against simply passively investing in a diversified basket of securities. First, I would start with analyzing your portfolio to understand its asset allocation. You can use a tool like the Morningstar XRay to do this. You may be happy with the asset allocation, or this tool may inform you to adjust your portfolio to meet your longterm goals. The next step will be to choose a benchmark. Given that you are investing primarily in nonUS securities, you may want to pick a globally diversified index such as the Dow Jones Global Index. Depending on the region and stock characteristics you are investing in, you may want to pick a more specialized index, such as the ones listed here in this WSJ list. With your benchmark set, you can then see how your portfolios returns compare to the index over time. IRR and ROI are helpful metrics in general, especially for corporate finance, but the comparisonbased approach gives you a better picture of your portfolios performance. You can still calculate your personal IRR, and make sure to include factors such as tax treatment and investment expenses that may not be fully reflected by just looking at benchmarks. Also, you can calculate the metrics listed in the Investopedia article, such as the Sharpe ratio, to give you another view on the riskadjusted return.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are the possible metrics for evaluating annual performance of a portfolio?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why IV and stock price are inversely related,"people are willing to pay higher premiums for options when stocks go down. Obviously the time value and intrinsic value and interests rates of the option doesnt change because of this so the miscalculation remainder is priced into the implied volatility part of the formula. Basically, anything that suggests the stock price will get volatile sharp moves in either direction will increase the implied volatility of the option. For instance, around earnings reports, the IV in both calls and puts in the nearest expiration dates are very high. When stocks go down sharply, the volatility is high because some people are buying puts for protection and others are buying calls because they think there will be a rebound move in the other direction. People the ""sleepatnight"" investors, not the derivatives traders   tend to be calm when stocks are going up, and fearful when they are going down.

Exercising an option without paying for the underlying,"This is dependent on the broker according to The Options Industry Council.

Most likely they will conduct a probabilistic simulation to see whether exercising the contracts may result in margin deficit even after selling the delivered shares under extreme circumstances. In most cases, brokers tend to liquidate the option for you sell to close before expiry. Ive seen people complain about certain brokers forcing liquidation at terrible bidask spreads even though the options are still days to expiry. It is better for you to close the position on your own beforehand. The best brokers would allow margin deficit and let you deposit the required amount of money afterward.

Can you explain the mechanism of money inflation?,"I dont think this can be explained in too simple a manner, but Ill try to keep it simple, organized, and concise. We need to start with a basic understanding of inflation. Inflation is the devaluing of currency in this context over time. It is used to explain that a 1 today is worth more than a 1 tomorrow. Inflation is explained by straight forward Supply  Demand economics. The value of currency is set at the point where supply M1 in currency speak  demand actual spending. Increasing the supply of currency without increasing the demand will create a surplus of currency and in turn weaken the currency as there is more than is needed inflation. Now that we understand what inflation is we can understand how it is created. The US Central Bank has set a target of around 2 for inflation annually. Meaning they aim to introduce 2 of M1 into the economy per year. This is where the answer gets complicated. M1 currency has a far reaching effect on secondary M2 credit currency that can increase or decrease inflation just as much as M1 can... For example, if you were given 100 M1 in new money from the Fed you would then deposit that 100 in the bank. The bank would then store 10 the reserve ratio in the Fed and lend out 90 M2 to me on via a personal loan. I would then take that loan and buy a new car. The car dealer will deposit the 90 from my car loan into the bank who would then deposit 10 with The Fed and his bank would lend out 81... And the cycle will repeat... Any change to the amount of liquid currency be it M1 or M2 can cause inflation to increase or decrease. So if a nation decides to reduce its US Dollar Reserves that can inject new currency into the market although the currency has already been printed it wasnt in the market. The currency markets aim to profit on currency imbalances and in reality momentary inflationdeflation between currencies.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can you explain the mechanism of money inflation?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

At what point should I begin paying off student loans?,"Everyone has made some good points that I was going to mention but to put it in terms that might make it easier to decide. As stated by others, paying off debt and being free is always the goal and desirable. However, you must also consider the ""efficiency"" of what you do as well. For example, there are two common types of student loans there are others but lets focus on these and that is subsidized and unsubsidized. The main difference? Subsidized loans dont earn interest on your balance while you are in school, it only happens when you graduate and come out of repayment grace period. Unsubsidized loans begin accumulating interest the moment they are disbursed, but you are not required to make payments on them until you graduate. All student loans are deferred until you graduate and exhaust your grace period or other means of deferring your payment, say for example a postponement or forbearance. However, it is often recommended that on UNSUBSIDIZED loans, you pay down your principle while still in school to avoid that massive interest amount that will get added to it when you are officially in repayment. On the other hand, it is often if not always recommended that you hold off on paying SUBSIDIZED loans until you are done and go into repayment, as for all intents and purposes its not costing you anything extra to wait. Family and parent loans are considered and treated more like personal loans, so treat them as such. Hope that helps. Also, dont forget to take advantage of the income based repayment options, as they will make the payments manageable enough to avoid making them a burden while you are trying to get a job and go post education.

"For a mortgage downpayment, what percentage is sensible?","The typical downpayment was expected to be 20. The idea being that if one could not save 15 of the cost of a house, they were not responsible enough to ensure repayment of the loan. It is hard to say whether this is truly a relevant measure.

It typically requires a fair amount of time to amass that much money and it does demonstrate some restraint. e.g. it is easily the cost of a decent new car or some other shiny ""toy.""

You will incur additional outlays to gain possession of your property ownership in your rental. Now the game of Landlord vs Landlord is different. You cant pick up houses easily enough and even if you could, likely the expense of doing so could wipe out any would profits from having the house as a rental.

What drives the stock of bankrupt companies?,"What drives the stock of bankrupt companies? Such stock is typically considered ""distressed assets"". Technically, what drives it is what drives every stock  supply and demand. A more interesting question is of course, why would there be demand? First, who exerts the buying pressure on the stock? Typically, three types of entities The largest ones are financial institutions specializing in distressed assets frequently, alternatives specialists  hedge funds, private equity firms etc.... Usually, they invest in distressed debt or distressed preferred equity but sometimes distressed equity as well. Why? We will discuss their motivations separately in this answer. Second one are existing equity holders. Why? Short answer, behavioral psychology and behavioral economics. Many investors  especially nonprofessionals  insist on holding distressed stocks due to variety of investment fallacies sunk cost etc... usually constructing elaborate theories of why and how the company and the stock will recover Sometimes, people who buy into penny stock scams, pump and dump schemes etc... Why? ""Theres a sucker born every minute.""  P.T. Barnum Lets find out why an investment professional would invest in distressed equity? First, the general process is always the same. Companys assets are used to pay off its liabilities in accordance with applicable law. There are two ways this can be done  either through selling the company OR through bankruptcy process. The liabilities are paid according to seniority. The seniority priorities rules are covered by 11 U.S. Code  507  Priorities A company in bankruptcy can have one of 2 outcomes Buyout. Some buyer might decide that the companys assets are worth something to them as a whole and buy the whole enterprise rather than risk it being destroyed piecemeal in bankruptcy proceedings. In that case, the proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the liabilities as discussed above. This option is one of the possible reasons people might consider investing in distressed equity. For example, if the company is in bankruptcy because it cant get enough financing right now, but is likely to have good profits in the future. The chances are, some buyer will buy it for a premium that includes those future profits and that sale amount might possibly exceed the liabilities. Bankruptcy. The assets are sold and liabilities are covered according to priorities. In that case, the investors in distressed equity might be hoping that there are unobvious assets whose value would also put the total assets above claimed liabilities. Additional possible beneficial factor is that unsecured debtors must file with the court in order to be paid and the claim must be validated. Some might fail on either count so total amount of liabilities might lessen once the bankruptcy process goes through. Assets Now, heres where things get interesting. Of course, companies have usual assets. Real estate, inventory, plants, cash, etc... These are all able to be sold to cover liabilities, and at first glance are possibly not enough to cover liabilities, leaving equity holders with nothing and even thats not a certainty  bankruptcy is simply inability to service debt payments and while it correlates to assetsliquid assets, not full asset valuation. But some assets are less sure, and are thus rarely included in such calculations. These may include Chances of winning appeals if specific existing liabilities are results of litigation, e.g. tax appeals, court judgement appeals etc... Clawbacks and lawsuits against former executives, especially in cases where the companys financial distress resulted from executive malfeasance. I was personally involved in one such case as an equity holder, where the company assets were valued at X had liabilities of X2 but had a real possibility of winning about X3 in a lawsuit against former CEO accused of various malfeasance including fraud and insider trading. As such, the best case scenario was literally 100 profit on holding that distressed equity.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What drives the stock of bankrupt companies?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

A stop order wont be automatically fired in afterhours trading?,"Stop orders and stop limit orders typically do not execute during extended hours after the general market session has closed. Stop orders are market orders and market orders especially are not executed during extended hours. Although there are exceptions because a broker can say one thing and do another thing with the way order types are presented to customers vs what their programming actually does. The regulatory burden is a slap on the wrist, so you need to ask the broker what their practices are. Orders created during normal market hours do not execute in extended sessions, different orders would have to be made during the extended session. Your stop order should execute if the normal market hour price stays below your stop price.

Is 401k as good as it sounds given the way it is taxed?,"when you contribute to a 401k, you get to invest pretax money. that means part of it e.g. 25 is money you would otherwise have to pay in taxes deferred money and the rest e.g. 75 is money you could otherwise invest base money. growth in the 401k is essentially tax free because the taxes on the growth of the base money are paid for by the growth in the deferred portion. that is of course assuming the same marginal tax rate both now and when you withdraw the money. if your marginal tax rate is lower in retirement than it is now, you would save even more money using a traditional 401k or ira. an alternative is to invest in a roth account 401k or ira. in which case the money goes in after tax and the growth is untaxed. this would be advantageous if you expect to have a higher marginal tax rate during retirement. moreover, it reduces tax risk, which could give you peace of mind considering u.s. marginal tax rates were over 90 in the 1940s. a roth could also be advantageous if you hit the contribution limits since the contributions are aftertax and therefore more valuable. lastly, contributions to a roth account can be withdrawn at any time tax and penalty free. however, the growth in a roth account is basically stuck there until you turn 60. unlike a traditional ira401k where you can take early retirement with a SEPP plan. another alternative is to invest the money in a normal taxed account. the advantage of this approach is that the money is available to you whenever you need it rather than waiting until you retire. also, investment losses can be deducted from earned income e.g. 1525, while gains can be taxed at the long term capital gains rate e.g. 015. the upshot being that even if you make money over the course of several years, you can actually realize negative taxes by taking gains and losses in different tax years. finally, when you decide to retire you might end up paying 0 taxes on your long term capital gains if your income is low enough currently 50kyr for a single person. the biggest limitation of this strategy is that losses are limited to 3k per year. also, this strategy works best when you invest in individual stocks rather than mutual funds, increasing volatility aka risk. lastly, this makes filing your taxes more complicated since you need to report every purchase and sale and watch out for the ""wash sale"" rules. side note you should contribute enough to get all the 401k matching your employer offers. even if you cash out the whole account when you want the money, the matching typically 50200 should exceed the 10 early withdrawal penalty.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?,"Others have already explained why lotteries have negative expected value, so in that sense it is never wise to buy a lottery ticket. I will provide an alternative view, that it is not always unwise to buy a lottery ticket even though the expected value of the lottery ticket is lower than its cost i.e. a loss. The question is what you mean with ""wise"" A not completely unlikely scenario is one where your life financially suck, and even if you saved the cost of the ticket instead of buying it your life would still suck. Even if you saved the cost for a ticket every week for 10 years, your live would not be essentially better. You could maybe afford a TV, or a new car in 40 years, but if you were to quantify the happiness of your life it would still be essentially crappy. But winning the lottery would significantly improve your life and make you happy. So in this scenario there are two choices, either save the money for 0 chance of a happy life, or spend it on a ticket for a extremely small chance of a good life. Yes, the expected value of saving the money is higher than when buying the ticket, but ""expected happiness"" is higher when buying the ticket nonzero. This is clearly an extreme example, but variants of this might apply the essence is that your valuation of the money is nonlinear, 1 million will make you more than 1000 times as happy as 1000.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do US retirement funds typically have way more US assets than international assets?,"To expand a bit on MSalterss answer ... When I read your question title I assumed that by ""retirement funds"" you meant targetdate funds that are close to their target dates say, the 2015 target fund. When I saw that you were referring to all targetdate funds, it occurred to me that examining how such funds modify their portfolios over time would actually help answer your question. If you look at a nearterm target fund you can see that a smaller percent is invested internationally, the same way a smaller percent is invested in stocks. Its because of risk. Since its more likely that you will need some of the money soon, and since youll be cashing out said money in US Dollars, its risky to have too much invested in foreign currencies. If you need money thats currently invested in a foreign currency and that currency happens to be doing poorly against USD at the moment, then youll lose money simply because you need it now. This is the same rationale that goes into targetdate funds moving from stocks to bonds over time. Since the value of a stock portfolio has a lot more natural volatility than the value of a bond portfolio, if youre heavily invested in stocks when you need to withdraw money, theres a higher probability that youll need to cash out just when stocks happen to be doing relatively poorly. Being invested more in bonds around when youll need your money is less risky. Similarly, being more invested in US dollars than in foreign currencies around when youll need your money is also less risky.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do US retirement funds typically have way more US assets than international assets?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does the yield on my investments stack up against other investors?,"It can be pretty hard to compute the right number. What you need to know for your actual return is called the dollarweighted return. This is the Internal Rate of Return IRR httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInternalrateofreturn computed for your actual cash flows. So if you add 100 per month or whatever, that has to be factored in. If you have a separate account then hopefully your investment manager is computing this. If you just have mutual funds at a brokerage or fund company, computing it may be a bunch of manual labor, unless the brokerage does it for you. A site like Morningstar will show a couple of return numbers on say an SP500 index fund. The first is ""time weighted"" and is just the raw return if you invested all money at time A and took it all out at time B. They also show ""investor return"" which is the average dollarweighted return for everyone who invested in the fund so if people sold the fund during a market crash, that would lower the investor return. This investor return shows actual returns for the average person, which makes it more relevant in one way these were returns people actually received but less relevant in another the return is often lower because people are on average doing dumb stuff, such as selling at market bottoms. You could compare yourself to the timeweighted return to see how you did vs. if youd bought and held with a big lump sum. And you can compare yourself to the investor return to see how you did vs. actual irrational people. .02, it isnt clear that either comparison matters so much after all, the idea is to make adequate returns to meet your goals with minimum risk of not meeting your goals. You cant spend ""beating the market"" or ""matching the market"" or anything else benchmarked to the market in retirement, you can only spend cash. So beating a terrible market return wont make you feel better, and beating a great market return isnt necessary. I think its bad that many investment books and advisors frame things in terms of a market benchmark. Market benchmarks have their uses, such as exposing indexhugging active managers that arent earning their fees, but to me its easy to get mixed up and think the market benchmark is ""the point""  I feel ""the point"" is to achieve your financial goals.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does the yield on my investments stack up against other investors?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How is an ETFs NAV determined?,"An ETF manager will only allow certain financial organisations to create and redeem ETF shares. These are called Authorised Participants APs. The APs have the resources to bundled up packages of shares that they already own and hold in order to match the ETFs requirements. In the case of the EDEN ETF, this portfolio is the MSCI Denmark Index. Only APs transact business directly with the ETF manager. When ETF shares need to be created, the AP will bundle up the portfolio of shares and deliver them to the ETF manager. In return, the ETF manager will deliver to the AP the corresponding number of shares in the ETF. Note that no cash changes hands here. These ETF shares are now available for trading in the market via the AP. Note that investors do not transact business directly with the ETF manager. Similarly, when ETF shares need to be redeemed, the AP will deliver the ETF shares to the ETF manager. In return, the ETF manager will deliver to the AP the corresponding portfolio of shares. Again, no cash changes hands here. Normally, with an established and liquid ETF, investors like you and me will transact small purchases and sales of ETF shares with other small investors in the market. In the event that an AP needs to transact business with an investor, they will do so by either buying or selling the ETF shares. In the event that they have insufficient ETF shares to meet demand, they will bundle up a portfolio deliver them to the ETF provider in return for ETF shares, thus enabling them to meet demand. In the event that a lot of investors are selling and the AP ends up holding an excessive amount of ETF shares, they will deliver unwanted shares to the ETF manager in exchange for a portfolio of the underlying shares. According to this scheme, large liquidations of ETF holdings should not effect the share prices of the underlying portfolio. This is because the underlying shares are not sold in the market, rather they are simply returned to the AP in exchange for the ETF shares Recall that no cash is changing hands in this type of transaction. The corresponding trail of dividends and distributions to ETF share holders follows the same scheme.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How is an ETFs NAV determined?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How to get into real estate with a limited budget,"You are neglecting a few very important things around real estate transactions in Belgium So in the end a 300K building may cost you more than 340K, lets take some unexpected costs into account and use 350K for remainder of calculation. Even worse if its newly built which I doubt the first percentage is 21 VAT instead of 10. All these costs can be checked on the useful site www.hoeveelkostmijnhuis.be Now, aside from that most banks will and actually have to demand you pay part of all this yourself. So you cant do 560K or 570K now. Mostly banks will only finance up to about 90 of the value of the building, so 90 of 300K, which is 270K 554K, the other 80K 516K you have to pay yourselves. But it could be the bank goes as low as 80. Another part to complicate the loan is how much you can pay a month. Since the mortgage crisis theyre very strict on this. There are lots of banks that will not allow you to make monthly payments of more than 33 of your monthly income when you are going to live there. This is a nuisance even when buying one house, you want to buy 2. Odds seem low theyll accept high monthly payments because you either need an additional loan or need to pay rent, so dont count on a 5y deal. Now this is all based on a single loan, it will probably be a bit different with multiple loans. However, it is unlikely any bank will accept this, even if all loans are with the same bank. You need to consider the basics of a realestate loan A bank trusts you can pay it off and if not they can seize the realestate hoping to regain their initial investment. Its very hard to seize a complete asset if only one out of 5 loantakers defected. You could maybe do this with another less restrictivehigher risk type of loan but rates will be a lot higher think 56 instead of 1.5. And dont underestimate the running costs for that price and 5 rooms in that city youre likely looking at an older building. Expect lots of cost for maintenance and keeping the building according to code. Also expect costs for repairs you rent to students.... Youll also have to pay quite a bit of money on insurances and of course on real estate taxes which are average in Ghent. Also factor in that currently there is not a housing shortage for Ghent students so you might not always have a guaranteed occupation. Also take into account responsibility if a fire breaks out or the house collapses or a gas leak occurs, you might be sued. It doesnt matter if youre at fault, its costly and a big nuisance. Simply because you didnt think of any of this dont do this. Its better to invest in real estate funds. But if you still think you can do better then all the landlords Ghent is riddled with, dont do it as a personal investment.

"If I pay taxes on my earnings, would someone also pay taxes on the same earnings if I subcontract them and pay a share?","If you want to subcontract some of your excess work to somebody else, you better be in business! While some kinds of employees e.g. commissioned salespeople are permitted to deduct some expenses on their income tax, generally only a real business can deduct wages for additional employees, or the cost of services provided by subcontractors. Do you invoice your clients and charge HST GST? Or do you tell your clients each pay period how many hours you worked and they compensate you through their payroll system like everybody else that walks through the door? If youre not invoicing and charging HST GST assuming you exceed the threshold, and if you have too much work, you probably do!, then perhaps your clients are treating you as an employee  by default  and withholding taxes, CPP, and EI so they dont get in trouble? After all, Canada Revenue Agency is likely to consider any person providing a service to a company to be an employee unless there is sufficient evidence to the contrary, and when there isnt enough evidence, its the company paying for the services that would be on the hook for unpaid taxes, CPP, and EI. Carefully consider what form of business you are operating, or were intending to operate. Its essential for your business to be structured appropriately if you want to hire or subcontract. You ought to be either selfemployed as a sole proprietor, or perhaps incorporated if it makes more sense to your situation. Next, act accordingly. For instance, its likely that your business should be taking care of the source deductions, CPP, and EI. In fact, selfemployed individuals shouldnt even be paying into EI  an independent contractor wouldnt qualify to make an EI claim if they lost a contract. As an independent, one doesnt have a job, one has a business, and EI doesnt cover the business itself, only the employees that the business deals with at arms length. As a business owner, you would be considered nonarmslength, and exempt from EI. Growing your business in the way that you are suggesting is an important enough a step that you should seek professional advice in advance. Find a good accountant that deals with selfemployed individuals  small businesses and run all this by him. He should be able to guide you accordingly. Find a lawyer, too. A lawyer can guide you on how to properly subcontract others while protecting you and your business. Finally, be mindful of what it is you agreed to in your contract with your client Do they expect all services to be performed by you, personally?

Is it a gift or not?,"Part of consideration, I imagine, would be the obligation of either party to follow through on an agreement, not only fair market value.

If he left after 2 hours because he forgot about a family event and did not finish your move, would he be breaking a contractual obligation to you even if you gave him 150? It seems it can be considered a gift Update in all cases There was no agreement of what either party viewed as full consideration in a mutual exchange. To put it another way From your examples, there is no evidence that the performance of either party hinged on receiving mutual consideration from the other.

If you gifted your friend with 150week when they watched your kids every MondayWednesday, that would be different. You are establishing a pattern, and I would suggest you may be establishing mutual consideration. In that case, consult a professional if you are worried. Amounts Matter This is why the gift tax exemption was created. The IRS does not care about the amounts in question here. It is too much of a burden to track and account for transactions that are this questionable and this small. You gift your friend with a 20k car? Now you need to pay attention. Consult your CPA. You gift your friend 1k for helping build your new deck? The IRS does not care. Intent Matters Even in the first case, it is not necessarily true that your friend considers 150 to be mutual consideration for his services. Would he open a business where he offers that rate to the general public? I doubt it. He intends to gift you services out of his own free will, not because there will be an equitable exchange of value. The intent of both parties is to give a gift. There is no evidence that would suggest otherwise to the IRS, it seems, even if they cared in the first place.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is it a gift or not?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How to transfer money to yourself internationally? ,"It really depends on the amount of money  I currently have to pay my mortgage in the UK from the US until my house there is sold and my wife sends money from her US Paypal account to my UK Paypal account.

Where was the huge scandal in the Wells Fargo scandal? ,"The Wells Fargo scandal was and still is a big deal because Wells Fargo opened over 1.5 million unauthorized bank and credit card accounts. The credit card accounts were opened without authorization, which means peoples credit scores and reports were pulled without permission. That is considered fraud and identity theft. Other than the legal side of it, by opening more bank accounts without authorization, it was showing ""synthetic growth"", which resulted in an inflated number when quarterly and annual performance numbers were reported. This caused people to invest more in Wells Fargo stock, not knowing that the growth in stock was not organic. After the scandal was uncovered, stocks decreased. However, the root cause of this can be traced to the culture at Wells Fargo, where customer service reps i.e. bank tellers, and store operations employees were faced with the challenges of meeting quotas that could be considered a stretch. As a result, faced with pressure from upper management, they opened unauthorized accounts. In addition, these unauthorized accounts cost consumers money either because credit cards had balances, or bank accounts did not meet a minimum balance. It is not about ending ""up with 8 rows in their database instead of just 1 row"" as OP wrote. It is about stealing consumer money and committing fraud and stealing the consumers identity.

Deposit cash into US bank account,"Sure you can deposit cash. A few notes apply Does the source of cash need to be declared ? If you deposit more than 10,000 in cash or other negotiable instruments, youll be asked to complete a form called a Currency Transaction Report heres the US Governments guidance for consumers about this form. Theres some very important information in that guidance document about structuring, which is a fairly serious crime that you can commit if you break up your deposits to avoid reporting. Dont do this. The linked document gives examples. Also dont refuse to make your deposit and walk away when presented with a CTR form. In addition, you are also required to report to Customs and Border Protection when you bring more than 10,000 in or out of the country. If you are caught not doing so, the money may be seized and you could be prosecuted criminally. Many countries have similar requirements, often with different dollar amounts, so its important to make sure you comply with their laws as well. The information from this reporting goes to the government and is used to enforce finance and tax laws, but theres nothing wrong or illegal about depositing cash as long as you dont evade the reporting requirements. You will not need to declare precisely where the cash comes from, but they will want the information required on the forms. Is it taxable ? Simply depositing cash into your bank account is not taxable. Receiving some forms of income, whether as cash or a bank deposit, is taxable. If you seem to have a large amount of unexplained cash income, it is possible an IRS audit will want an explanation from you as to where it comes from and why it isnt taxable. In short, if the income was taxable, you should have paid taxes on it whether or not you deposit it in a bank account. What is the limit of the deposit ? There is no government limit.

How to find cheaper alternatives to a traditional home telephone line?,"Cheapest is one thing. You can absolutely shop in the market and find the lowest possible price. I can think of three places to shop, each with an up and downside. I would think that what you really mean is the best price for the service. Just like shopping for a car you have to decide what you need vs what is nice to have. Decide what features you need. Do you need long distance? Do you need caller id? Do you need to call technophobic friends and family? Find out what you have available to you through associations. Often schools, work or a club you belong to have deals for service discounts. Look at your insurance plan or AAA membership for the crazy discounts. Decide what kinds of service will meet your needs. Buy the cheapest service. DO NOT ENTER A CONTRACT. Even if the price is slightly lower. At least not at first. If you try out your service and love it, enter the contract if and only if the total price measured over length of the contract is less. With cell phones especially, it is absolutely possible to save money buying month to month vs a 2 year contract. Even when you buy equipment for full price up front. Ask for the bare minimum service from your local phone company. Because phone companies are often regulated monopolies, they might have a bare minimum level of service they are required to offer by the municipality. They probably dont advertise it or push it, but it might exist if you call and ask.

Pay off car loan entirely or leave 1 until the end of the loan period?,"what you aim to do is a great idea and it will work in your favor for a number of reasons. First, paying down your loan early will save you lots in interest, no brainer. Second, keeping the account open will improve your credit score by 1 increases the number of installment trade lines you have open, 2adds to your positive payment history and 3 varies your credit mix. If your paid your car off you will see a DROP in your credit score because now you have one less trade line. To address other issues as far as credit scoring, it does not mattermuch for your score if you have a 1000 car loan or a 100,000 car loan. what matters is whether or not you pay on time, and what your balance is compared to the original loan amount. So the quicker you pay DOWN the loans or mortgages the better. Pay them down, not off! As far how the extra payments will report, one of two things will happen. Either they will report every month paid as agreed most likely, or they wont report anything for a few years until your next payment is dueunlikely, this wont hurt you but wont help you either. Someone posted they would lower the amount you paid every month on your report and thus lower your score. This is not true. even if they reported you paid 1 month the scoring calculations do not care. All they care is whether or not youre on time, and in your case you would be months AHEAD of timeeven though your report cant reflect this fact either HOWEVER, if you are applying for a mortgage the lower monthly payment WOULD affect you in the sense that now you qualify for a BIGGER loan because now your debt to income ratio has improved. People will argue to just pay it off and be debt free, however being debt free does NOT help your credit. And being that you own a home and a car you see the benefits of good credit. You can have a million dollars in the bank but you will be denied a loan if you have NO or bad credit. Nothing wrong with living on cash, Ive done it for years, but good luck trying to rent a car, or getting the best insurance rates, and ANYTHING in life with poor credit. Yeah it sucks but you have to play the game. I would not pay down do 1 though because like someone else said they may just close the account.

Why does gold have value?,"It has semantic value because we culturally believe gold is valuable. There is a very important point here. Gold and many other coin metals.

What does it mean that stocks are memoryless?,"This is an interesting question that may actually be better suited to Quant.SE. First of all, stock prices are random variables, or, to be more precise, stochastic processes a timeordered string of random variables. The alternative to being stochastic is being deterministic, and I doubt you believe that stock prices are deterministic meaning, they are fully knowable in advance. The fact that real world events drive the randomness has no bearing on whether or not it is random. So, to start, I think you have confused the technical definition of random with a colloquial concept. Now, the heart of the question is whether stock prices are memoryless. Ultimately, this is an empirical question that has been addressed in many academic studies. The conclusion of most of this research is that stock prices are ""almost"" memoryless, in the sense that the distribution of future stock prices displays very little dependence upon past realizations, although a few persistent anomalies remain. One of the most robust deviations from memorylessness is the increase in the volatility of a stock following large declines. Another is persistence in volatility. In general, in fact, the volatility is far more predictable than the mean of stock price changes. Hence ""memorylessness"" is a far stronger assumption than the efficient markets hypothesis. The bottom line, however, is that the deviations from memorylessness are relatively small. As such, despite its limitations, it is a decent working assumption in some contexts.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What does it mean that stocks are memoryless?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"How do payday money stores fund their buy now, pay later loans? ","Payday loan companies basically are banks although they are incredibly terrible ones. Banks make money in two ways 1 They charge fees for services they provide bank account fees, etc. and 2 The interest rate differential They borrow money from individuals and corporations your savings account is essentially money you are loaning to the bank for a small  paid to individuals, and then lend that money back to other people for a higher . ie You might earn 0.5 on your savings account, but then the bank takes that money and lends it to your neighbor for 2.5 as part of their mortgage. Payday loan companies make money in one way They charge an enormous markup on money lent out to other people. The rates in some cases are so high annualized interest rates of 1000 are not uncommon in countries without full regulation of this industry, that it barely matters where they get money from. They might get money from investors [who bought shares in the company, giving the company initial cash in the hope that they give dividends down the road], they might get money from other real banks [who lend money just like they would lend money to any other business, with a regular interest rate], or they might have many from many other sources. They might even issue their debt publically, so that individuals could buy bonds from the company and receive a small amount of interest every year.

Online transaction  Money taken out late,"When processing creditdebit cards there is a choice made by the company on how they want to go about doing it. The options are AuthorizationCapture and Sale. For online transactions that require the delivery of goods, companies are supposed to start by initially Authorizing the transaction. This signals your bank to mark the funds but it does not actually transfer them. Once the company is actually shipping the goods, they will send a Capture command that tells the bank to go ahead and transfer the funds. There can be a time delay between the two actions. 3 days is fairly common, but longer can certainly be seen. It normally takes a week for a gas station local to me to clear their transactions. The second one, a Sale is normally used for online transactions in which a service is immediately delivered or a Point of Sale transaction buying something in person at a store. This action wraps up both an Authorization and Capture into a single step. Now, not all systems have the same requirements. It is actually fairly common for people who play online games to ""accidentally"" authorize funds to be transferred from their bank. Processing those refunds can be fairly expensive. However, if the company simply performs an Authorization and never issues a capture then its as if the transaction never occurred and the costs involved to the company are much smaller close to zero Id suspect they have a high degree of parents claiming their kids were never authorized to perform transactions or that fraud was involved. If this is the case then it would be in the companys interest to authorize the transaction, apply the credits to your account then wait a few days before actually capturing the funds from the bank. Depending upon the amount of time for the wait your bank might have silently rolled back the authorization. When it came time for the company to capture, then theyd just reissue it as a sale. I hope that makes sense. The point is, this is actually fairly common.

Why would a longterm investor ever chose a Mutual Fund over an ETF?,"First, its not always the case that ETFs have lower expenses than the equivalent mutual funds. For example, in the Vanguard family of funds the expense ratio for the ETF version is the same as it is for the Admiral share class in the mutual fund version. With that in mind, the main advantages of a mutual fund over an equivalent ETF are From a longterm investors point of view, the main disadvantage of mutual funds relative to ETFs is the minimum account sizes. Especially if the fund has multiple share classes i.e., where better classes get lower expense ratios, you might have to have quite a lot of money invested in the fund in order to get the same expense ratio as the ETF. There are some other differences that matter to more active investors e.g., intraday trading, options, etc., but for a passive investor the ones above are the major ones. Apart from those mutual funds and ETFs are pretty similar. Personally, I prefer mutual funds because Im at a point where the fund minimums arent really an issue, and I dont want to deal with the more fiddly aspects of ETFs. For investors just starting out the lower minimum investment for an ETF is a big win, as long as you can get commissionfree trades which is what Ive assumed above.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why would a longterm investor ever chose a Mutual Fund over an ETF?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way?,"1. Is this right? Pretty much, though this is a really rudimentary way to think about it. 2. If it is, why is it that extensive services are provided by high margin companies competing for talent, rather then lower margin businesses looking to boost their profits by reducing their expenditures on employees by cutting out the government? Its the polar opposite of that. Google and companies like that do things like have a day care center on premises. The company staffs a day care center which has costs, then lets employees use it for free. This is a business expense for Google, and in relative terms, a considerably large business expense that a lower margin business could no afford. Employer healthcare is a tax protected expense for employees via section 125 of the tax code. The company portion of the healthcare costs are a deductible business expense to the company, as expected. Healthcare is different than most other expenses because the employee can forego income before its effectively received which negates it from taxable income. This doesnt work for something like food purchased at a cafe on a Google complex. If employee money is being spent at a corporate cafe, its taxable income being spent though the cost of running the cafe is a tax deductible business expense to the company. There have been discussions in congress to assess a value as income to employees for services like on site child care and no cost employee cafeterias. To address your new example For example, suppose John Doe makes 100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20, for a take home pay of 80,000. He spends 10,000 on food. His employer Corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense  costing them 10,000. But now they can pay John Doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by 10,000  87,500 The company is now spending 97500 employing John Doe, for a savings of 2500. This would be an audit prone administrative nightmare. Either You need John to submit receipts for reimbursement up to the 10,000 agreed upon amount which would require some kind of administrative staff, or After a very short period of time John forgets the abstract value of the food cost arrangement, that is only really benefiting the employer in the form of lower payroll expense, and is enticed away for more pay somewhere else anyway. The company may be saving 2,500, though again there will be an additional administrative expense of some sort, but John is only saving 500 97,500  0.20  100,000  0.20.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"For net worth, should I value physical property at my cost to replace it, or the amount I could get for selling it?","My opinion including the value of depreciating property one owns in a net worth calculation is silly  but could be interesting You dont expect your TV or laptop to gain value. Instead, you expect them to decrease in value every year until you replace them. Anything you expect to hold or increase in value art, a house, etc is a different story. If youd like to really get anal about this, you can track your net worth like a business would track its balance sheet. Im not going to go into detail, but the general idea is that when you purchase an item, you debit the cost from ""cash"" and add the value paid to ""assets"" so your net worth doesnt change when you make a purchase. You then depreciate the value of the item under ""assets"" according to a depreciation schedule. If you plan on replacing your laptop every three years, you might subtract 33 of the value every year. This could be an interesting exercise i.e. even if you make money, your net worth may decrease because of all the depreciating junk you own, but my hunch is that it wouldnt be worth the effort it requires.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: For net worth, should I value physical property at my cost to replace it, or the amount I could get for selling it?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Cannot get a mortgage because I work through a recruiter,Some options See if the seller will sell to you on Contract. With a significant down payment the seller may be willing to sell you the condo on contract. This fill in the year or so you will probably need to go from contractor to full time employee with enough time on the job to get a mortgage. Keep Shopping. Be up front with the lenders with the problems you are running into and see if any of them can find you a solution. You may need to take a higher rate in the short term but hopefully you can refinance in a few years to a more reasonable rate. Check with a local bank or credit union. Many times local banks or CUs will finance high demand properties that may be out of favor with the super banks that have no ties to your community. These banks sometimes realize that just because the standard spreadsheet says this is a bad risk the reality is the specific property you are interested in is not the risk that it appears on paper. You will have to find a bank that actually retains its mortgages as many local banks have become agents that just sell mortgages to the mortgage market. Talk to a Realtor.

Are Certificates of Deposit worth it compared to investing in the stock market?,"A CD is guaranteed to pay its return on maturation. So if you need a certain amount of money at a specific time in the future, the CD is a more reliable way of getting it. The stock market might give you more money or less. More is obviously OK. Less is not if youre planning to pay basic expenses with it, e.g. food, rent, etc. Most retirement portfolios will have a mix of investments. Some securities stocks and bonds, some guaranteed returns CDs, treasuries, and some cash equivalents money market, savings, and checking accounts. Cash equivalents are good for short term expenses and an emergency fund. Guaranteed returns are good for medium term expenses. Securities are good for the long term. Once retired, the general system is to maintain enough cash equivalents for the next few months of expenses and emergencies. Then schedule CDs for the next few years so that you have a predictable amount. Finally, keep the bulk of your wealth in securities. As you get older, your potential emergencies increase and your need for savings decreases, so the mix shifts more and more to the cash equivalents and guaranteed returns and away from securities. CDs have limited use prior to retirement and the couple years right before retirement, mainly saving up for a large purchase like a house, car, or major appliance. Even there if you have the option of delaying the purchase, that might allow you to use securities instead. Perhaps some of your emergency fund in a short term CD that you keep rolling over. Note that the problem isnt so much that securities will fall. Its that theyll fall right when you need the money. So rather than sell 1 of your securities to meet your needs, you have to sell 2. Thats a dead weight loss of 1 that you have to deduct from your returns. That roughly matches the drop from the height of 2007 to the trough of 2009 of the SP 500.

Calculating the total capital of a company?,"I was wondering how do we calculate the total capital of a company? Which items should I look for in the financial statements? Total capital usually refers to the sum of longterm debt and total shareholder equity both of these items can be found on the companys balance sheet. This is one of the calculations thats traditionally used when determining a companys return on capital. Ill use the balance sheet from Gilead Sciences GILD 2012 10K form as an example. Net longterm debt was 7,054,555,000 and total stockholder equity was 9,550,869,000 which should give a grand total of 16,605,424,000 for total capital. I know you can do the math, but I always find an example helpful if it uses realistic numbers. You may sometimes hear the term ""total capital"" referring to ""total capital stock"" or ""total capital assets,"" in which case it may be referring to physical capital, i.e. assets like inventory, PPE, etc., instead of financial capitalleverage. And how do I calculate notes payable? Is the same as accounts payable? As the word ""payable"" suggests, both are liabilities. However, Ive always been taught that accounts payable are debts a business owes to its suppliers, while notes payable are debts a business owes to banks and other institutions with which it has signed a formal agreement and which use formal debt instruments, e.g. a loan contract. This definition seems to match various articles I found online. On a balance sheet, you can usually determine notes payable by combining the shortterm debt of the company with the current portion of the longterm debt. These pieces comprise the debt that is due within the fiscal year. In the balance sheet for Gilead Sciences, I would only include the 1,169,490,000 categorized as ""Current portion of longterm debt and other obligations, net"" term, since the other current liabilities dont look like they would involve formal debt contracts. Since the notes payable section of GILDs balance sheet doesnt seem that diverse and therefore might not make the best example, Ill include the most recent balance sheet Monsanto as well.1 Monsantos balance sheet lists a term called ""Shortterm debt, including current portion of longterm debt"" with a value of 36 million. This looks like almost the exact definition of notes payable. 1.

Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?,"I think playing certain kinds of lottery is as economically sound as buying certain kinds of insurance. A lottery is an inverted insurance. Let me elaborate. We buy insurance for at least two reasons. The first one is clear We pay a fee to protect ourselves from a risk which we dont want to or cannot bear. Although on average buying insurance is a loss, because we pay all the insurances office buildings and employees salaries, it still is a reasonable thing to do. But it should also be clear that it is unreasonable to buy insurance for risks one could easily bear oneself. The second reason to buy insurance is that it puts us at ease. We dont have to be afraid of theft or of a mistake we make which would make us liable or of water damage to our house. In that sense we buy freedom of sorrow for a fee, even if the damage wouldnt in fact ruin us. Thats totally legitimate. Now I want to make the argument that buying a lottery ticket follows the same logic and is therefore not economically unreasonable at all. While buying a lottery ticket is on average a loss, it provides us with a chance to obtain an amount of money we would normally never get. Eric Lippert made this argument already. The lottery fee buys us a small chance of something very valuable, much as the insurance frees us from a small risk of something very bad. If we dont buy the ticket, we may have 0 chance of becoming extremely rich. If we buy one, we clearly have a chance  0, which can be considered an improvement. Imagine youd have a 0.0000001 chance to save the life of a loved one with a ticket whod be 100 doomed otherwise. Youd bite. Even the second argument, that an insurance puts us at ease, can be mirrored for lotteries. The chance to win something may provide entertainment in our otherwise dull everyday life. Considering that playing the lottery only makes sense for the chance to obtain more money than otherwise possible, one should avoid lotteries which have lots of smaller prizes because we are not really interested in those. It would be more economical to save the money for smaller amounts. We ideally only want lotteries which lean on the big money prizes.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How do top investors pull out 20 ROI?,"First of all, the annual returns are an average, there are probably some years where their return was several thousand percent, this can make a decade of 2 a year become an average of 20 . Second of all, accredited investors are allowed to do many things that the majority of the population cannot do. Although this is mostly tied to net worth, less than 3 of the US population is registered as accredited investors. Accredited Investors are allowed to participate in private offerings of securities that do not have to be registered with the SEC, although theoretically riskier, these can have greater returns. Indeed a lot of companies that go public these days only do so after the majority of the growth potential is done. For example, a company like Facebook in the 90s would have gone public when it was a million dollar company, instead Facebook went public when it was already a 100 billion dollar company. The people that were privileged enough to be ALLOWED to invest in Facebook while it was private, experienced 10000 returns, public stock market investors from Facebooks IPO have experienced a nearly 100 return, in comparison. Third, there are even more rules that are simply different between the ""underclass"" and the ""upperclass"". Especially when it comes to leverage, the rules on margin in the stock market and options markets are simply different between classes of investors. The more capital you have, the less you actually have to use to open a trade. Imagine a situation where a retail investor can invest in a stock by only putting down 25 of the value of the stocks shares. Someone with the net worth of an accredited investor could put down 5 of the value of the shares. So if the stock goes up, the person that already has money would earn a greater percentage than the peon thats actually investing to earn money at all. Fourth, Warren Buffetts fund and George Soros funds arent just in stocks. George Soros claim to fame was taking big bets in the foreign exchange market. The leverage in that market is much greater than one can experience in the stock market. Fifth, Options. Anyone can open an options contract, but getting someone else to be on the other side of it is harder. Someone with clout can negotiate a 10 year options contract for pretty cheap and gain greatly if their stock or other asset appreciates in value much greater. There are cultural limitations that prompt some people to make a distinction between investing and gambling, but others are not bound by those limitations and can take any kind of bet they like.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How do top investors pull out 20 ROI?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Online tutorials for calculating DCF Discounted Cash Flow?,"Check out Professor Damodarans website httppages.stern.nyu.eduadamodar . Tons of good stuff there to get you started. If you want more depth, hes written what is widely considered the bible on the subject of valuation ""Investment Valuation"". DCF is very well suited to stock analysis. One doesnt need to know, or forecast the future stock price to use it. In fact, its the opposite. Business fundamentals are forecasted to estimate the sum total of future cash flows from the company, discounted back to the present. Divide that by shares outstanding, and you have the value of the stock. The key is to remember that DCF calculations are very sensitive to inputs. Be conservative in your estimates of future revenue growth, earnings margins, and capital investment. I usually develop three forecasts pessimistic, neutral, optimistic. This delivers a range of value instead of a falseprecision single number. This may seem odd I find the DCF invaluable, but for the process, not so much the result. The input sensitivity requires careful work, and while a range of value is useful, the real benefit comes from being required to answer the questions to build the forecast. It provides a framework to analyze a business. Youre just trying to properly fill in the boxes, estimate the unguessable. To do so, you pore through the financials. Skimming, reading with a purpose.

Clarification on 529 fund,"You are faced with a dilemma. If you use a 529 plan to fund your education, the short timeline of a few years will limit your returns that are tax free. Most people who use a 529 plan either purchase years of tuition via lump sum, when the child is young or they put aside money on a regular basis that will grow tax deferredtax free. Some states do give a tax break when the contribution is made by a state taxpayer into a plan run by the state. The long term plans generally use a risk profile that starts off heavily weighted in stock when the child is young, and becomes more fixed income as the child reaches their high school years. The idea is to protect the fund from big losses when there is no time to recover. If you choose the plan with the least risk the issue is that the amount of gains that are being protected from federal tax is small. If you pick a more aggressive plan the risk is that the losses could be larger than the state tax savings. Look at some of the other tax breaks for tuition to see if you qualify Credits An education credit helps with the cost of higher education by reducing the amount of tax owed on your tax return. If the credit reduces your tax to less than zero, you may get a refund. There are two education credits available the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit.

There are additional rules for each credit, but you must meet all three of the following for either credit If youre eligible to claim the lifetime learning credit and are also eligible to claim the American opportunity credit for the same student in the same year, you can choose to claim either credit, but not both. You cant claim the AOTC if you were a nonresident alien for any part of the tax year unless you elect to be treated as a resident alien for federal tax purposes. For more information about AOTC and foreign students, visit American Opportunity Tax Credit  Information for Foreign Students. Deductions Tuition and Fees Deduction You may be able to deduct qualified education expenses paid during the year for yourself, your spouse or your dependent. You cannot claim this deduction if your filing status is married filing separately or if another person can claim an exemption for you as a dependent on his or her tax return. The qualified expenses must be for higher education. The tuition and fees deduction can reduce the amount of your income subject to tax by up to 4,000. This deduction, reported on Form 8917, Tuition and Fees Deduction, is taken as an adjustment to income. This means you can claim this deduction even if you do not itemize deductions on Schedule A Form 1040. This deduction may be beneficial to you if, for example, you cannot take the lifetime learning credit because your income is too high.

How to calculate my estimated taxes. 1099 MISC  Self Employment,"There is a shortcut you can use when calculating federal estimated taxes. Some states may allow the same type of estimation, but I know at least one my ownIllinois that does not. The shortcut you can completely base your estimated taxes for this year on last years tax return and avoid any underpayment penalty. A quick summary can be found here emphasis mine If your prior year Adjusted Gross Income was 150,000 or less, then you can avoid a penalty if you pay either 90 percent of this years income tax liability or 100 percent of your income tax liability from last year dividing what you paid last year into four quarterly payments. This rule helps if you have a big spike in income one year, say, because you sell an investment for a huge gain or win the lottery. If wage withholding for the year equals the amount of tax you owed in the previous year, then you wouldnt need to pay estimated taxes, no matter how much extra tax you owe on your windfall. Note that this does not mean you will not owe money when you file your return next April this shortcut ensures that you pay at least the minimum allowed to avoid penalty. You can see this for yourself by filling out the worksheet on form 1040ES. Line 14a is what your expected tax this year will be, based on your estimated income. Line 14b is your total tax from last year, possibly with some other modifications. Line 14c then asks you to take the lesser of the two numbers.

All the companies in an individual industry can have a downturn together, so he invests everything in an SP 500 index fund. David looks at Charlie and notes that hes got everything in large, highcapitalization companies. Smallcap stocks are often where the growth happens, so he invests in a total stock market fund.

Why does short selling require borrowing?,"Concerning the general problem of short selling and the need to borrow shares to complete the transaction  Selling short is a cash transaction. Unlike a futures contract, where a short seller is entering into a legal agreement to sell something in the future, in the case of short selling a share the buyer of the share is taking immediate delivery and is therefore entitled to all of the benefits and rights that come with share ownership. In particular, the buyer of the shares is entitled to any dividends payable and, where applicable, to vote on motions at AGMs. If the short seller has not borrowed the shares to sell, then buyer of nonexistent shares will have none of the rights associated with ownership. The cash market is based on the idea of matching buyers and sellers. It does not accommodate people making promises. Consider that to allow short sellers to sell shares they have not borrowed opens up the possibility of the aggregate market selling more shares than actually exist. This would lead to all sorts of problematic consequences such as heavily distorting the price of the underlying share. If everyone is selling shares they have not borrowed willynilly, then it will drive the price of the share down, much to the disadvantage of existing share holders. In this case, short sellers who have sold shares they have not already borrowed would be paying out more in dividends to the buyers than the total dividends being paid out by the underlying company. There are instruments that allow for short selling of unowned shares on a futures basis. One example is a CFD  Contract for Difference. In the case of CFDs, sellers are obliged to pay dividends to buyers as well as other costs related to financing. EDIT Regarding your comment, note that borrowing shares is not a market transaction. Your account does not show you buying a share and then selling it. It simply shows you selling a share short. The borrowing is the result of an agreement between yourself and the lender and this agreement is off market. You do not actually pay the lender for the shares, but you do pay financing costs for the borrowing so long as you maintain your short position. EDIT I realise that I have not actually read your question correctly. You are not actually talking about ""naked"" short selling. You are talking about selling shares you already own in a hope of maintaining both a long and short position gross. The problem with this approach is that you must deliver the shares to the buyer. Otherwise, ask yourself what shares is the buyer actually buying if you want the bought shares to remain in your account. If you are not going to deliver your long position shares, then you will need to borrow the shares you are selling short for the reasons I have outlined above.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why does short selling require borrowing?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

When to trade in a relatively new car for maximum value,"So this has been bugging me for a while, because I am facing a similar dilemma and I dont think anyone gave a clear answer. I bought a 2012 kia soul in 2012. 36 months financing at 300mo. Will be done with my car loan in 2015. I plan on keeping it, while saving the same amount of money 300mo until I buy my next car. But, I also have an option of trading it in for the the next car. Question should I trade it in in 2015. should I keep it for 2 years more? 3 years more, before I buy the next car? What makes most financial sense and savings. I tried to dig up some data on edmunds  the tradein value and ""true cost to own"" calculator. The make and model of my car started in 2010, so I do not have historical data, as well as ""cost to own"" calculator only spans 5 years. So  this is what I came up with Where numbers in blue are totally made upbecause I dont have the data for it. Granted, the tradein values for the ""future"" years are guesstimated  based on Kia Souls tradein values from previous years 2010, 2011, 2012 But, this is handy, and as it gets closer to 2015 and beyond, I can replug in the data where it is available and have a better understanding of the tradein vs keep it longer decision. Hope this helps. If the analysis is totally off the rocker, please let me know  ill adjust itdelete it.

What is a closedend fund? How is a closedend fund different from a typical mutual fund?,"A closedend fund is a collective investment scheme that is closed to new investment once the fund starts operating. A typical openended fund will allow you to buy more shares of the fund anytime you want and the fund will create those new shares for you and invest your new money to continue growing assets under management. A closedend fund only using the initial capital invested when the fund started operating and no new shares are typically created always exception in the financial community. Normally you buy and sell an openend fund from the fund company directly. A closedend fund will usually be bought and sold on the secondary market. Here is some more information from Wikipedia Some characteristics that distinguish a closedend fund from an ordinary openend mutual fund are that Another distinguishing feature of a closedend fund is the common use of leverage or gearing to enhance returns. CEFs can raise additional investment capital by issuing auction rate securities, preferred shares, longterm debt, andor reverserepurchase agreements.

Why is cheque cashing a legitimate business?,"How does this get any business? Youd be surprised on how much profit these type of businesses can bring in and the number of people who cash their checks this way. They make profit off people who want their checks cashed ASAP. Usually cheques written to ""cash"" or something can just be cashed for free at the bank right? Yes, most banks cash your check for free. Some may not cash it right away and may require a few days to process. Some charge a small fee if the check is not from the same bank. Some personal checks may not even be processed the same day as well. Wouldnt the only cheques that people would cash at these places be bad cheques? Yes and no. Yes because it may be ""easier"" to try to cash a fraudulent check at these type of check cashing places. However, some places may only cash business checks and require your ID in which they write down the information in order to possibly track you down in the future. Also some places only cash a check to a certain amount. And wouldnt this mean that the business will lose a lot of money since it pays out cash but then has the cheque bounce? Of course the business loses money if the check bounces or is fake. That is why they try to minimize their losses with certain requirements that needs to met before the check can be cashed. Who uses these services exactly? Just about anyone who needs their check cashed ASAP or like ChrisW stated in his answer is trying to keep their money on the low.

Purpose of having good credit when you are welloff?,"Credit in general having no significant change between an income level or net worth is due to the economic reciprocity principle inherent in many societies. Although some areas of credit may be more admirable to those who arent as welloff, such as car loans, the overall understanding of credit is a trust agreement between someone getting something e.g., credit card user and someone giving something e.g., bank or company. Credit doesnt have to mean just money  it can be anything of value, including tangible materials, services, etc. The fact is that a credit is a common element in most economical systems, and as such its use is not really variable between income levelsetc. Sure, there is variance in things like credit line amounts and rewards, but the overall gist is the same for everyone  borrowing, paying back, benefits, etc. All of these exchanges form the same understanding we all know and follow. Credit brings along with it trust  the form represented in a score. While not everyone may depend entirely on credit, and no one should use credit as a means of getting by entirely money, everyone can understand and reap the benefits of a system whether they make 10K a year of 10M a year. This is the general idea behind credit in the broadest sense possible. Besides, just because one has or makes more money doesnt mean they dont prefer to get good deals. Nobody should like being taken advantage of, and if credit can help, anyone can establish trust.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Purpose of having good credit when you are welloff?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is technical analysis based on some underlying factors in the market or do they work simply because other people use them?,"Technical analysis is based more on psychology than anything else. As an example, if an analyst estimates or believes that a stock is undervalued, or simply wants to rebalance their portfolio, then they will buy some amount, moving the price up. Others in the market see the upwards move as the start of an upwards trend, an indication that the stock is undervalued or perhaps even that an insider is trading ahead of better than expected data from the firm. They then buy the stock creating a selffulfilling prophecy and pulling more traders in as they see an upward trend being confirmed. This is even more pronounced in a bear market as fear is an even stronger driver. When a trader sees a stock is falling they are more likely to jump to the conclusion that it is due to expected poor performance of the firm and that the firm and the economy are both in trouble and going down than to think that it is simply a retrenching or a large investor rebalancing etc. To quote Credit Suisse [1] A chart is a mirror of the mood of the crowd and not of the fundamental factors. Thus, technical analysis is the analysis of human mass psychology. Therefore, it is also called behavioral finance. The underlying truth that makes technical analysis work is that people are predictably irrational, at least in the short run and tend to follow the same patterns of thought. references [1] httpswww.creditsuisse.compwppbpbresearchtechnicaltutorialde.pdf [2] httpwww.amazon.comThePsychologyTechnicalAnalysisProfitingdp1557385432 [3] CFA level 1 syllabus",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is technical analysis based on some underlying factors in the market or do they work simply because other people use them?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Received an unexpected cashiers check for over 2K from another state  is this some scam?,"It is likely a scam. In fact the whole mystery shopping ""job"" may be a scam. There is a Snopes page about cashiers check scams, as well as a US government page which specifically mentions mystery shopping as a scam angle. As for how the scam works, from the occ.gov site I just linked However, cashiers checks lately have become an attractive vehicle for fraud when used for payments to consumers. Although, the amount of a cashiers check quickly becomes ""available"" for withdrawal by the consumer after the consumer deposits the check, these funds do not belong to the consumer if the check proves to be fraudulent. It may take weeks to discover that a cashiers check is fraudulent. In the meantime, the consumer may have irrevocably wired the funds to a scam artist or otherwise used the fundsonly to find out later, when the fraud is detectedthat the consumer owes the bank the full amount of the cashiers check that had been deposited. It is somewhat unusual in that, from what you say, there has been no attempt thus far to get money back. However, your sisterinlaw may have received that info separately, or received it as part of her mystery shopping job but didnt mention it to you with regard to this check. Typically the scam involves telling the recipient to transfer money to a third party e.g., by buying goods as a mystery shopper, or via wire transfer to ""reimburse"" someone associated with a sham operation. By the time the cashiers check is revealed as fraudulent, the victim has already transferred away hisher own real money. Its probably worth taking the check to your or her bank and asking them about it. They may have more info. Also, banks usually want to know about scams like this because, in the long run, they accumulate data on them and share that with law enforcement and can eventually catch some of the scammers. Edit Just to help anyone who may be reading this later. The letter you added confirms it is absolutely a scam. My boss was once contacted via a scam operation very similar to this. The huge red flag in addition to others already mentioned is that you are being ""given"" a check for over 2000, of which only 25 is purportedly for actual mystery shopping and 285 is payment for you, the mystery shopper. The whole rest of the 2000 amount is for you to wire to ""another MysterySecret Shopper in order for them to complete their assignment"". They are giving you 2000 to give to someone else who is supposedly another one of their own employeescontractors. Ask yourself what sane business would conduct their operations in this way. If you work at a law office, or a hamburger stand, or a school, or anything you like, does your boss ever say ""Here is your paycheck for 5000. I know you only earned 1000, but Im just going to give you the whole 5000, and youre supposed to use 4000 of it to pay your coworker Joe his wages."" No. There is no reason to do that except that the ""other mystery shopper"" is actually the scammer.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Received an unexpected cashiers check for over 2K from another state  is this some scam?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Do the proceeds from selling an option immediately convert to buying power in a margin account?,"Yes. I heard back from a couple brokerages that gave detailed responses. Specifically In a Margin account, there are no SEC trade settlement rules, which means there is no risk of any free ride violations. The SEC has a FAQ page on freeriding, which states that it applies specifically to cash accounts. This led me to dig up the text on Regulation T which gives the ""freeriding"" rule in 220.8c, which is titled ""90 day freeze"". 220.8 is the section on cash accounts. Nothing in the sections on margin accounts mentions such a settlement restriction. From the Wikipedia page on Free Riding, the margin agreement implicitly covers settlement. ""Buying Power"" doesnt seem to be a Regulation T thing, but its something that the brokerages that Ive seen use to state how much purchasing power a client has. Given the response from the brokerage, above, and my reading of Regulation T and the relevant Wikipedia page, proceeds from the sale of any security in a margin account are available immediately for reinvestment. Settlement is covered implicitly by margin i.e. it doesnt detract from buying power. Additionally, I have personally been making these types of trades over the last year. In a sub25K margin account, proceeds are immediately available. The only thing I still have to look out for is running into the daytrading rules.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Do the proceeds from selling an option immediately convert to buying power in a margin account?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How should I deal with my long term gain this year?,"Long term capital gains are taxed at 15 this year, so the most you stand to save is 150. I wouldnt sell anything at a loss just to offset that, unless you planned on selling anyways. A few reasons The Long term capital gains rate will go up to 20 next year, so your losses will be ""worth more"" next year than this year. Short term capital gains rates will go up next year as well, so again, better off saving your losses for next year. You must use capital losses to offset capital gains if you have them, but if you dont have any capital gains, you can use capital losses to offset ordinary income up to a limit  3,000 a year IIRC. So, if you just bite the bullet and pay the 15 on your gains this year, you could use your losses to offset your likely higher rate ordinary income next year.

Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?,"To be clear, a 401K is a vehicle, you make investments WITHIN it, if you choose poorly such as say putting all your money into company stock when working for the next Enron, you can still get hurt badly. So it is important to have diversity and an appropriate risk level based on your age, tolerance for risk, etc. That said, as vehicles go it is outstanding, and the always max your 401K is very very common advice for a large number of investing professionals, CFAs, pundits, etc. That said there are a few priorities to consider here. First priority, if there is some level of company matching, grab that, its hard to beat that kind of return in almost any other case. Second, since you never want to tap into a 401K if you can at all avoid it before you are ready to retire, you should first be sure you have a good emergency fund set aside in the event you lose your job, or some other major catastrophy happens. Many recommend setting aside at least 6 months of basic living expenses. Third, if you have any high interest debt like credit card debt pay that stuff down as fast as you can. Youll save a ton of interest its pretty much the same as investing the money you use to pay it down, and getting a return equal to the interest rate you are paying, with zero risk.. cant be beat. Youll also end up with a lot better cash flow, and the ability to start saving first and spending out of savings, so you earn interest instead of paying it. Once you have those things out of the way, then it is time to think about fully funding the 401K. and keep in mind, since you dont pay taxes on it, the felt effect to you pocket is about 80 or even less, of what goes into the account, so its not as painful as you might think, and the hit to your take home may be less than youd expect. Contributing as much as you can, as early as you can also lets you benefit from the effect of compounding, and has a far larger affect on the balance than money put into the account closer to retirement. So if you can afford to max it out, I surely would advise you to do so.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Highrisk investing is better for the young? Why?,"There is no ruleofthumb that fits every person and every situation. However, the reasons why this advice is generally applicable to most people are simple. Why it is good to be more aggressive when you are young The stock market has historically gone up, on average, over the long term. However, on its way up, it has ups and downs. If you wont need your investment returns for many years to come, you can afford to put a large portion of your investment into the volatile stock market, because you have plenty of time for the market to recover from temporary downturns. Why it is good to be more conservative when you are older Over a shortterm period, there is no certainty that the stock market will go up. When you are in retirement, most people withdrawsell their investments for income. And once you reach a certain age, you are required to withdraw some of your retirement savings. If the market is in a temporary downturn, you would be forced to ""sell low,"" losing a significant portion of your investment. Exceptions Of course, there are exceptions to these guidelines. If you are a young person who cant help but watch your investments closely and gets depressed when seeing the value go down during a market downturn, perhaps you should move some of your investment out of stocks. It will cost you money in the long term, but may help you sleep at night. If you are retired, but have more saved than you could possibly need, you can afford to risk more in the stock market.

First, customers absolutely hate it  and when you drop the interest bomb, they will warn their friends away, blow you up on social media, call the TV news consumer protectors, and never, ever, ever do business with you again. Which defeats your efforts in customer acquisition. Second, it only works on that narrow range of people who default just a little bit, i.e. who have an autopay malfunction. If someone really defaults, not only will they not pay the punishment interest, they wont pay the principal either!

"If you buy something and sell it later on the same day, how do you calculate investment?","Nothing wrong with the other answers, but heres a ""trick"" to hopefully make it totally transparent. Imagine that youre not the one implementing this business plan, but someone else is. Lets call this other person your asset manager. So on the first day, you give your asset manager 9. He takes this and generates 1 profit from it, recovering the 9 which he then reinvests to generate 1 profit every day. From your perspective, you just gave him 9. At the end of the year, he gives you 365 in addition to your original investment of 9 in real life hed take the fees of course, or perhaps hes been lending out the money hes been accumulating and taking the interest from that as pay for his services.

Using multiple bank accounts,"I live near historic Concord, Massachusetts, and frequently drive past Walden Pond. Im reminded of Henry David Thoreaus words, ""Simplify, simplify, simplify."" In my opinion, fewer is better. 2 checkbooks? I dont see how that makes budgeting any easier. The normal set of expenses are easily kept as one bucket, one account. The savings 23 accounts can also be combined and tracked if you really want to think of them as separate accounts. Now, when you talk about Retirement that can be in taxwise retirement accounts, e.g. 401k, IRA, etc. or post tax regular brokerage accounts. In our situation, the Schwab nonretirement account was able to handle emergency as money market funds along with vacationrainy day, etc, in CDs of different maturities. As an old person, I remember CDs at 10 or higher, so leaving money in lower interest accounts wasnt good. Cash would go to CDs at 15 year maturities to maximize interest, but keep money maturing every 69 months. Even with the goal of simplifying, my wife and I each have a 401k, an IRA, and a Roth IRA, I also have an inherited Roth, and I manage my teens Roth and brokerage accounts. Thats 9 accounts right there. No way to reduce it. To wrap it up, Id go back to the first 4 you listed, and use the 4 checking attached to the broker account to be the emergency fund. Now youre at 3.

"Over the long term, why invest in bonds?","Bonds provide protections against stock market crashes, diversity and returns as the other posters have said but the primary reason to invest in bonds is to receive relatively guaranteed income. By that I mean you receive regular payments as long as the debtor doesnt go bankrupt and stop paying. Even when this happens, bondholders are the first in line to get paid from the sale of the businesss assets. This also makes them less risky. Stocks dont guarantee income and shareholders are last in line to get paid. When a stock goes to zero, you lose everything, where as a bondholder will get some face value redemption to the notes issue price and still keep all the previous income payments. In addition, you can use your bond income to buy more shares of stock and increase your gains there.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Over the long term, why invest in bonds?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Allocation between 401Kretirement accounts and taxable investments, as a young adult?","I would say yes, it makes sense to keep some money in taxable accounts. Retirement accounts are for retirement, and the various early withdrawal penalties are designed to enforce that. If youre anticipating using the money before retirement e.g., for home purchase, it makes sense to keep it out of retirement accounts. On the other hand, be aware that, regardless of what kind of account it is in, you face the usual riskreturn tradeoff. If you put your money in the SP 500 and the SP 500 tanks just before you were going to buy a house, your down payment evaporates and you will have to wait and buy a house later. You can manage this by shifting the allocation of this money and perhaps cashing it out if a certain amount is gained i.e., it grows to the level of your target down payment and you are close enough to the house purchase time that you dont want to risk it anymore. Basically, if you invest money for a preretirement use, you may want to keep it in a taxable account, but you also need to take account of when youll need it and manage the risk accordingly.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

"When people say Interest rates are at all time low!""  Which interest rate are they actually referring to?","I would say people are generally talking about the prime lending rate. I have heard the prime lending rate defined as ""The rate that banks charge each other when they borrow money overnight."" But it often defined as the rate at which banks lend their most creditworthy customers. That definition comes with the caveat that it is not always held to strictly. Either definition has the same idea its the lowest rate at which anyone could currently borrow money. The rate for many types of lending is based upon the prime rate. A variable rate loan might have an interest rate of Prime  x. The prime rate is in turn based upon the Federal Funds Rate, which is the rate that the Fed sets manually. When the news breaks that ""the Fed is raising interest rates by a quarter of a point"" or similar it is the Federal Funds Rate that they control. Lending institutions then ""fall in line"" and adjust the rates at which they lend money. So to summarize When people refer to ""high"" or ""low"" or ""rising"" interest rates they are conceptually referring to the prime lending rate. When people talk about the Fed raisinglowering interest rates In the U.S. they are referring specifically to the Federal Funds Rate which ultimately sets other lending rates.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: When people say Interest rates are at all time low!""

The borrowing happens over phone and fax and the lending bank sending a high value transaction that credits the borrowing banks. These is the day to day job of treasury group [highly paid individuals] to manage liquidity. Now if on weekends the volume is less, it does not make sense to keep these people, the cost of supporting this for very insiginificant business gain is not driving to build such systems.

Is there an academic framework for deciding when to sell inthemoney call options?,"based on my understanding of your query...well you need to understand ATM and ITM options.

Suppose you find strikeprice of 320  300  280. So 320 is ITM, 300 is ATM and 280 is OTM for call options. So will the delta value e.g 0.66  0.55  0.35. So suppose if stock price rise by 7 i.e Rs. 321 then strikeprice will rise simultaneously. Say ATM CE300 is rs.10 it will start rising by 0.55 i.e. Rs.10.55. The moment the share price move from Rs.300 to Rs.320 your ATM will turn to ITM. Now the tricker part if you buy OTM and the share price rise by 15 your OTM will now become ITM and your profit will roll around 100 to 120 approx.

The danger to the Euro is that countries will withdraw their participation in order to micromanage their economies more effectively. If a major country withdraws its participation, it could start a domino effect where many countries withdraw so that they too can manage their economies more effectively.

Whats a Letter of Credit? Are funds held in my bank for the amount in question?,"A letter of credit is commonly used by importers who want to ensure that their product is shipped before paying the exporter. The exporter has a guarantee that the payment for the goods will be received once the shipment has been made. It is used to resolve a Game Theory type situation. For example, you are buying a car from China for 40,000 USD. The exporter of the car asks for the money before he will ship the car, but if you give him the money, then he has no incentive aside from legal pressures to ship the car. Instead you sign a letter of credit for the transaction, which basically sends your payment to the exporters bank, but puts a hold on it until the exporter proves that he has shipped the car and proved that he has insured the shipment against damages.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Whats a Letter of Credit?

Although I do not know about the ING scheme, normally there is no prepayment option on interest only mortgages, its Bank way of earning a fixed income for the contracted period and thats the reason why the interest rates are lower than a regular mortgage.

Paying off a loan with a loan to get a better interest rate,"I dont know what rates are available to you now, but yes, if you can refinance your car at a better rate with no hidden fees, you might save some money in interest. However, there are a couple of watchouts Your original loan was a 6 year loan, and you have 5 years remaining. If you refinance your car with a new 6 year loan, you will be paying on your car for 7 years total, and you will end up paying more interest even though your interest rate might have gone down. Make sure that your new loan, in addition to having a lower rate than the old loan, does not have a longer term than what you have remaining on the original loan. Make sure there arent any hidden fees or closing costs with the new loan. If there are, you might be paying your interest savings back to the bank in fees. If your goal is to save money in interest, consider paying off your loan early. Scrape together extra money every month and send it in, making sure that it is applied to the principal of your loan. This will shorten your loan and save you money on interest, and can be much more significant than refinancing. After your loan is paid off, continue saving the amount you were spending on your car payment, so you can pay cash for your next car and save even more.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Paying off a loan with a loan to get a better interest rate?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Unusual real estate market with seemingly huge rental returns,"I would not claim to be a personal expert in rental property. I do have friends and family and acquaintances who run rental units for additional income andor make a full time living at the rental business. As JoeTaxpayer points out, rentals are a casheating business. You need to have enough liquid funds to endure uncertainty with maintenance and vacancy costs. Often a leveraged rental will show high ROI or CAGR, but that must be balanced by your overall risk and liquidity position. I have been told that a good ruleofthumb is to buy in cash with a target ROI of 10. Of course, YMMV and might not be realistic for your market. It may require you to do some serious bargain hunting, which seems reasonable based on the stagnant market you described. Some examples The main point here is assessing the risk associated with financing real estate. The ROI or CAGR of a financed property looks great, but consider the Net Income. A few expensive maintenance events or vacancies will quickly get you to a negative cash flow. Multiply this by a few rentals and your risk exposure is multiplied too!

Do Banks Cause Inflation? What are other possible causes?,"Some people believe that inflation is caused by an increase in the money supply when the banks engage in fractional reserve lending. Is this correct? You are referring to the Austrian school of thought. The Austrians define inflation in terms of money supply. In other words, inflation is defined as an increase in the aggregate money supply, even if prices stay the same of fall. This is not the only definition of inflation. The mainstream defines inflation as a general increase in the prices of consumer goods. Based on the first definition, then your supposition is correct by definition. Based on the second definition, you can make a case that money supply affects prices. But keep in mind, its just one factor affecting prices. Furthermore, economics is resistant to experimentation, so it is difficult to establish causality. Austrian economists tend to approach the problem of ""proof"" using a 2pronged tactic establish plausibility by explaining the mechanism, then look for historical evidence to back up that explanation. As I understand it, when there is more available money in the market, the price of goods will increase. But will a normal merchant acknowledge the increase of money supply and raise prices immediately? I posit that, in the short run, merchants wont increase prices in response to increased money supply. So, why does increased money supply lead to price inflation? The simple answer, in the Austrian school of thought, is that you have more money chasing the same amount of goods. In other words, printing money doesnt actually increase the number of widgets made. I believe the Austrian school is consistent with your supposition that prices dont increase in the short run. In other words, producers dont increase prices immediately after observing an increase in the money supply. Specifically, after the banks print more notes, where will the money be distributed first? The Austrian story goes as follows Imagine that the first borrower is a home constructor, and he is borrowing freshly ""printed"" money to build new homes. This constructor will need to buy materials and hire labor to build homes, and in doing so he will bid against other home constructors. The increased demand for lumber, nails, tools, carpentry, etc. will ever so slightly increase the market prices for these goods and services. So the money goes first to the borrower, but then flows also to the people selling to the borrower, and the people selling to the sellers, etc. It has a ripple effect. Who will be the first one to have a need to rise their price? These producers wont need to increase their price, but they will choose to do so if the believe that demand outstrips supply. In other words if you have more orders than you can fill, then you may post higher prices because you think consumers will tolerate the higher price. You might object that competition deters any one producer from unilaterally raising prices, but in fact if all producers are failing to keep up with demand, then you can unilaterally raise prices because other producers dont have any excess inventory to undercut you with.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Do Banks Cause Inflation?

With an individual plan, you make the contributions yourself and then get a tax deduction when you file. Since contributions to traditional and Roth IRAs combined are capped at 5,500 if youre under 50, some sort of employersponsored plan might be better from a contribution standpoint. If your institution offers some sort of plan other than a 401k, you might still want to roll to a traditional IRA, since you will have much more flexibility in the investments you choose.

Can the Securities Investor Protection Corporation SIPC itself go bankrupt?,"SIPC is a corporation  a legal entity separate from its owners.

Any legal entity can go bankrupt. A person can go bankrupt. A country can go bankrupt. And so can anything in between. However, looking at the history of things, there are certain assumptions that can be made. These are mere guesses, as theres no law about any of these things to the best of my knowledge, but seeing how things were  we can try and guess that they will also be like this in the future. I would guess, that in case of a problem for the SIPC to meet its obligation, any of the following would happen or combinations Too big to fail  large insurance companies had been bailed out before by the governments since it was considered that their failure would be more destructive to the economy than the bailout. AIG as an example in the US. SIPC is in essence is an insurance company. So is Lloyds of London. Breach of trust of the individual investors that can lead to a significant market crash. Thats what happened in the US to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Theyre now ""officially"" backed by the US government. If SIPC is incapable of meeting its obligation, I would definitely expect the US government to step in, even though theres no such obligation. Raising funds through charging other members. If the actuary calculations were incorrect, the insurance companies adjust them and raise premiums. That is what should happen in this case as well. While may not necessarily solve a cashflow issue, in the long term it will allow SIPC to balance, so that bridge loans from the US governmentFedspublic bonds could be used in between. Not meeting obligations, i.e. bankruptcy. That is an option, and insurance companies have gone bankrupt before. Not unheard of, but from the past experience  again, Id expect the US government to step in. In general, I dont see any significant difference between SIPC in the US and a ""generic"" insurance coverage elsewhere.

Should I pay off my 401k loan or reinvest the funds elsewhere?,"This summer I used a loan from my 401k to help pay for the down payment of a new house. We planned on selling a Condo a few months later, so we only needed the loan for a short period but wanted to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying two mortgages for a few months. I also felt like the market might take a dip in the future, so I liked the idea of trying to cash out high and buy back low spoiler alert this didnt happen. So in July 2017 I withdrew 17,000 from my account Technically 16,850.00 principal and 150 processing fee at an effective 4.19 APR 4 rate and then the fee, with 240 scheduled payments of 86.00 2 per month for 10 years. Over the lifetime of the loan the total finance charge was 3,790, but that money would be paid back into my account. I was happy with the terms, and it helped tide things over until the condo was sold a few months later. But then I decided to change jobs, and ended up having to pay back the loan 20 weeks after it was issued using the proceeds from the sale of the condo. During this time the market had done well, so when I paid back the funds the net difference in shares that I now owned including shares purchased with the interest payments was 538.25 less than todays value of the original count of shares that were sold to fund the loan. Combined with the 150 fee, the overall ""cost"" of the 20 week loan was about 4.05. That isnt the interest rate interest was paid back to my account balance, but the value lost due to the principal having been withdrawn. On paper, my account would be worth that much more if I hadnt withdrawn the money. Now if you extrapolate the current market return into 52 weeks, you can think of that loan having an APR ""cost"" of around 10.5 Probably not valid for a multi year calculation, but seems accurate for a 12 month projection. Again, that is not interest paid back to the account, but instead the value lost due to the money not being in the account. Sure, the market could take a dip and I may be able to buy the shares back at a reduced cost, but that would require keeping sizable liquid assets around and trying to time the market. It also is not something you can really schedule very well, as the loan took 6 days to fund not including another week of clarifying questions backforth before that and 10 day to repay from the time I initiated the paperwork to when the check was cashed and shares repurchased. So in my experience, the true cost of the loan greatly depends on how the market does, and if you have the ability to pay back the loan it probably is worth doing so. Especially since you may be forced to do so at any time if you change jobs or your employment is terminated.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

In the meantime, heres my nonprofessional advice from personal experience and hindsight If youre in a lowmedium tax bracket and your 401k sucks, you might be better off to pay the tax up front and invest in a taxable account for the flexibility assuming youre disciplined enough that you dont need the 401k to protect you from yourself. If you max out a crappy 401k today, you might miss a better opportunity to contribute to a 401k in the future. Big expenses could pop up at exactly the same time you get better investment options. Side note if not enough employees participate in the 401k, the principals wont be able to take full advantage of it themselves.

What are the scenarios if mining company around 4c decides to halt stock trading due to capital raising?,"It appears that the company in question is raising money to invest in expanding its operations specifically lithium production but that is off topic for here. The stock price was rising on the back of perceived increases in demand for the companys products but in order to fulfil demand they need to either invest in higher production or increase prices. They chose to increase production by investing. To invest they needed to raise capital and so are going through the motions to do that. The key question as to what will happen with their stock price after this is broken down into two parts short term and long term In the short term the price is driven by the expectation of future profits see below and the behavioural expectations from an increase in interest in the stock caused by the fact that it is in the news. People who had never heard of the stock or thought of investing in the company have suddenly discovered it and been told that it is doing well and so ""want a piece of it"". This will exacerbate the effect of the news broadly positive or negative and will drive the price in the short run. The effect of extra leverage assuming that they raise capital by writing bonds also immediately increases the total value of the company so will increase the price somewhat. The short term price changes usually pare back after a few months as the shine goes off and people take profits. For investing in the long run you need to consider how the increase in capital will be used and how demand and supply will change. Since the company is using the money to invest in factors of production i.e. making more product it is the return on capital or investment employed ROCE that will inform the fundamentals underlying the stock price. The higher the ROCE, the more valuable the capital raised is in the future and the more profits and the company as a whole will grow. A questing to ask yourself is whether they can employ the extra capital at the same ROCE as they currently produce. It is possible that by investing in new, more productive equipment they can raise their ROCE but also possible that, because the lithium mines or whatever can only get so big and can only get so much access to the seams extra capital will not be as productive as existing capital so ROCE will fall for the new capital.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are the scenarios if mining company around 4c decides to halt stock trading due to capital raising?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"In India, what is the difference between Dividend and Growth mutual fund types?","A growth fund is looking to invest in stocks that will appreciate in stock price over time as the companies grow revenues and market share. A dividend fund is looking to invest in stocks of companies that pay dividends per share. These may also be called ""income"" funds. In general, growth stocks tend to be younger companies and tend to have a higher volatility  larger up and down swings in stock price as compared to more established companies. So, growth stocks are a little riskier than stocks of more establishedstable companies. Stocks that pay dividends are usually more established companies with a good revenue stream and well established market share who dont expect to grow the company by leaps and bounds. Having a stable balance sheet over several years and paying dividends to shareholders tends to stabilize the stock price  lower volatility, less speculation, smaller swings in stock price. So, income stocks are considered lower risk than growth stocks. Funds that invest in dividend stocks are looking for steady reliable returns  not necessarily the highest possible return. They will favor lower, more reliable returns in order to avoid the drama of high volatility and possible loss of capital. Funds that invest in growth stocks are looking for higher returns, but with that comes a greater risk of losing value. If the fund manager believes an industry sector is on a growth path, the fund may invest in several small promising companies in the hopes that one or two of them will do very well and make up for lackluster performance by the rest. As with all stock investments, there are no guarantees. Investing in funds instead of individual stocks allows you invest in multiple companies to ride the average  avoid large losses if a single company takes a sudden downturn. Dividend funds can lose value if the market in general or the industry sector that the fund focuses on takes a downturn.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: In India, what is the difference between Dividend and Growth mutual fund types?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do interest rates increase or decrease?,"My answer is specific to the US because you mentioned the Federal Reserve, but a similar system is in place in most countries. Do interest rates increase based on what the market is doing, or do they solely increase based on what the Federal Reserve sets them at? There are actually two rates in question here the Wikipedia article on the federal funds rate has a nice description that Ill summarize here. The interest rate thats usually referred to is the federal funds rate, and its the rate at which banks can lend money to each other through the Federal Reserve. The nominal federal funds rate  this is a target set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve at each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC. When you hear in the media that the Fed is changing interest rates, this is almost always what theyre referring to. The actual federal funds rate  through the trading desk of the New York Federal Reserve, the FOMC conducts open market operations to enforce the federal funds rate, thus leading to the actual rate, which is the rate determined by market forces as a result of the Feds operations. Open market operations involve buying and selling shortterm securities in order to influence the rate. As an example, the current nominal federal funds rate is 0 in economic parlance, this is known as the Zero Lower Bound ZLB, while the actual rate is approximately 25 basis points, or 0.25. Why is it assumed that interest rates are going to increase when the Federal Reserve ends QE3? I dont understand why interest rates are going to increase. In the United States, quantitative easing is actually a little different from the usual open market operations the Fed conducts. Open market operations usually involve the buying and selling of shortterm Treasury securities in QE, however especially the latest and ongoing round, QE3, the Fed has been purchasing longerterm Treasury securities and mortgagebacked securities MBS. By purchasing MBS, the Fed is trying to reduce the overall risk of the commercial housing debt market. Furthermore, the demand created by these purchases drives up prices on the debt, which drives down interest rates in the commercial housing market. To clarify the debt market Im referring to is the market for mortgagebacked securities and other debt derivatives CDOs, for instance. Ill use MBS as an example. The actual mortgages are sold to companies that securitize them by pooling them and issuing securities based on the value of the pool. This process may happen numerous times, since derivatives can be created based on the value of the MBS themselves, which in turn are based on housing debt. In other words, MBS arent exactly the same thing as housing debt, but theyre based on housing debt. Its these packaged securities the Fed is purchasing, not the mortgages themselves. Once the Fed draws down QE3, however, this demand will probably decrease. As the Fed unloads its balance sheet over several years, and demand decreases throughout the market, prices will fall and interest rates in the commercial housing market will fall. Ideally, the Fed will wait until the economy is healthy enough to absorb the unloading of these securities. Just to be clear, the interest rates that QE3 are targeting are different from the interest rates you usually hear about. Its possible for the Fed to unwind QE3, while still keeping the ""interest rate"", i.e. the federal funds rate, near zero. although this is considered unlikely. Also, the Fed can target longterm vs. shortterm interest rates as well, which is once again slightly different from what I talked about above. This was the goal of the Operation Twist program in 2011 and in the 1960s. Kirill Fuchs gave a great description of the program in this answer, but basically, the Fed purchased longterm securities and sold shortterm securities, with the goal of twisting the yield curve to lower longterm interest rates relative to shortterm rates. The goal is to encourage people and businesses to take on longterm debt, e.g. mortgages, capital investments, etc. My main question that Im trying to understand is why interest rates are what they are. Is it more of an arbitrary number set by central banks or is it due to market activity? Hopefully I addressed much of this above, but Ill give a quick summary. There are many ""interest rates"" in numerous different financial markets. The rate most commonly talked about is the nominal federal funds rate that I mentioned above although its a target set by the Board of Governors, its not arbitrary. Theres a reason the Federal Reserve hires hundreds of research economists. No central bank arbitrarily sets the interest rate its determined as part of an effort to reach certain economic benchmarks for the foreseeable future, whatever those may be. In the US, current Fed policy maintains that the federal funds rate should be approximately zero until the economy surpasses the unemployment and inflation benchmarks set forth by the Evans Rule named after Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who pushed for the rule. The effective federal funds rate, as well as other rates the Fed has targeted like interest rates on commercial housing debt, longterm rates on Treasury securities, etc. are market driven. The Fed may enter the market, but the same forces of supply and demand are still at work. Although the Feds actions are controversial, the effects of their actions are still bound by market forces, so the policies and their effects are anything but arbitrary.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do interest rates increase or decrease?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is the difference between a stop order and a stop limit order?,"An attempt at a simple answer for the normal investor A normal investor buys stock then later sells that stock. This is known as ""going long"", as opposed to ""going short"". For the normal investor, a stop order of either kind is only used when selling. A stoploss sell order or stop sell is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price, and you dont want to suffer more losses. If the stock is at 50, you could enter a stop sell at 40, which means if the stock ever falls to 40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available e.g. 35. A stoploss limit sell order or stop limit sell is the same, except you are also saying ""but dont sell for less than my limit price"". So you can enter a stop limit sell at 40 with a limit of 39, meaning that if the stock falls to 40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at 39 or higher. Thus your stock will never be sold at 35 or any value below 39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from 40 to 35, your limit sell at 39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock worth at that moment 35, say.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is the difference between a stop order and a stop limit order?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do interest rates increase or decrease?,"Fundamentally interest rates reflect the time preference people place on money and the things money can buy. If I have a high time preference then I prefer money in my hand versus money promised to me at some date in the future. Thus, I will only loan my money to someone if they offer me an incentive which would be an amount of money to be received in the future that is larger than the amount of money Im giving the debtor in the present i.e. the interest rate. Many factors go into my time preference determination. My demand for cash i.e. my cash balance, the credit rating of the borrower, the length of the loan, and my expectation of the change in currency value are just a few of the factors that affect what interest rate I will loan money. The first loan I make will have a lower interest rate than the last loan, ceteris paribus. This is because my supply of cash diminishes with each loan which makes my remaining cash more valuable and a higher interest rate will be needed to entice me to make additional loans. This is the theory behind why interest rates will rise when QE3 or QEinfinity ever stops. QE is where the Federal Reserve cartel prints new money to purchase bonds from cartel banks. If QE slows or ends the supply of money will stop increasing which will make cash more valuable and higher interest rates will be needed to entice creditors to loan money. Note that increasing the stock of money does not necessarily result in lower interest rates. As stated earlier, the change in value of the currency also affects the interest rate lenders are willing to accept. If the Federal Reserve cartel deposited 1 million everyday into every US citizens bank account it wouldnt take long before lenders demanded very high interest rates as compensation for the decrease in the value of the currency. Does the Federal Reserve cartel affect interest rates? Yes, in two ways. First, as mentioned before, it prints new money that is loaned to the government. It either purchases the bonds directly or purchases the bonds from cartel banks which give them cash to purchase more government bonds. This keeps demand high for government bonds which lowers the yield on government bonds yields move inverse to the price of the bond. The Federal Reserve cartel also can provide an unlimited amount of funds at the Federal Funds rate to the cartel member banks. Banks can borrow at this rate and then proceed to make loans at a higher rate and pocket the difference. Remember, however, that the Federal Reserve cartel is not the only market participant. Other bond holders, such as foreign governments and pension funds, buy and sell US bonds. At some point they could demand higher rates. The Federal Reserve cartel, which currently holds close to 17 of US public debt, could attempt to keep rates low by printing new money to buy all existing US bonds to prevent the yield on bonds from going up. At that point, however, holding US dollars becomes very dangerous as it is apparent the Federal Reserve cartel is just a money printing machine for the US government.

What is a typical investment portfolio made up of?,"Most people carry a diversity of stock, bond, and commodities in their portfolio. The ratio and types of these investments should be based on your goals and risk tolerance.

If youre investing for retirement you are definitely best to keep as much of your investment as possible in 401k or IRAs preferably Roth IRAs. Many advisers suggest contributing as much to your 401k as your company matches, then the rest to IRA, and if you over contribute for the IRA back to the 401k. You may choose to skip the 401k if you are not comfortable with the choices your company offers in it such as only investing in company stock. If you are investing for a point closer than retirement and you still want the risk and reward potential of stock I would suggest investing in low tax mutual funds, or eating the tax and investing in regular mutual funds. If you are going to take money out before retirement the penalties of a 401k or IRA make it not worth doing.

Notes Payable This is another old fashioned term that now carries a different meaning in Generally Accepted Account Principles GAAP. The oldest definition of a note or a promissory note is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money on a specific date. This has been modified to resemble more a bond and evolved into the zero coupon bond, a bond that makes no cash interest payments but makes one final payment that includes principal  interest. A bank note, like a One Dollar bill, is a note that pays something, in this case One Dollar, never technically, the repayment date is simply not specified in the contract. While it pays One Dollar, it never pays it back, so it has a constant value of One Dollar. The constant nature, inflation notwithstanding, is what makes bank notes the preferred medium of exchange.

Is dividend taxation priced in derivatives?,"While derivative pricing models are better modeling reality as academia invests more into the subject, none sufficiently do. If, for example, one assumes that stock returns are lognormal for the purposes of pricing options like Black Scholes does, the only true dependent variable becomes logstandard deviation otherwise known as ""volatility"", producing the infamous ""volatility smile"" which disappears in the cases of models with more factors accounting for other mathematical moments such as mean, skew, and kurtosis, etc. Still, these more advanced models are flawed, and suffer the same extreme time mispricing as Black Scholes. In other words, one can model anything however one wants, but the worse the model, the stranger the results since volatility for a given expiration should be constant across all strikes and is with better models. In the case of pricing dividends, these can be adjusted for the many complexities of taxation, but the model becomes ever more complex and extremely computationally expensive for each eventuality. Furthermore, with more complexity in any model, the likelihood of discovering a closed form in the short run is less. For equities in a low interest rate, not high dividend yield, not low volatility, low dividend tax environment, the standard swap pricing models will not provide results much different from one where a single low tax rate on dividends is assumed. If one is pricing a swap on equity outside of the bounds above, the dividend tax rate could have more of an effect, but for computational efficiency, applying a single assumed dividend tax rate would be optimal with D1x, instead of D in a formula, where D is the dividend paid and x is the tax rate. In short, a closed form model is only as good as its assumptions, so if anomalies appear between the actual prices of swaps in the market and a swap model then that model is less correct than the one with smaller anomalies of the same type. In other words, if pricing equity swaps without a dividend tax rate factored more closely matches the actual prices than pricing with dividend taxes factored then it could be assumed that pricing without a dividend tax factored is superior. This all depends upon the data, and there doesnt seem to be much in academia to assist with a conclusion. If equity swaps do truly provide a tax advantage and both parties to a swap transaction are aware of this fact then it seems unlikely swap sellers wouldnt demand some of the tax advantage back in the form of a higher price. A model is no defense since volatility curves persist despite what Black Scholes says they should be.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is dividend taxation priced in derivatives?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do employers require you to spread your 401k contributions throughout the year to get the maximum match?,"The only way to know the specific explanation in your situation is to ask your employer. Different companies do it differently, and they will have their reasons for that difference. Ive asked ""But why is it that way?"" enough times to feel confident in telling you its rarely an arbitrary decision. In the case of your employers policy, I can think of a number of reasons why they would limit match earnings per paycheck Vesting, in a sense  Much as stock options have vesting requirements where you have to work for a certain amount of time to receive the options, this policy works as a sort of vesting mechanism for your employer matching funds. Without it, you could rapidly accumulate your full annual match amount in a few pay periods at the beginning of the year, and then immediately leave for employment elsewhere. You gain 100 of the annual match for only 12 months of work, while the employees who remain there all year work 12 months to gain the same 100. Dollar Cost Averaging  By purchasing the same investment vehicle at different prices over time, you can reduce the impact of volatility on your earnings. For the same reason that 401k plans usually restrict you to a limited selection of mutual funds  namely, the implicit assumption is that you probably have little to no clue about investing  they also do other strategic things to encourage employees to invest at least somewhat wisely. By spacing their matching fund out over time, they encourage you to space your contributions over time, and they thereby indirectly force you to practice a sensible strategy of dollar cost averaging. Dollar Cost Averaging, seen from another angle  Mutual funds are the 18wheeler trucks of the investment superhighway. They carry a lot of cargo, but they are difficult to start, stop, or steer quickly. For the same reasons that DCA is smart for you, its also smart for a fund. The money is easier to manage and invest according to the goals of the fund if the investments trickle in over time and there are no sudden radical changes. Imagine if every employer that does matching allowed the full maximum match to be earned on the first paycheck of the year  the mutual funds in 401ks would get big balloons of money in January followed by a drastically lower investment for the rest of the year. And that would create volatility. Plan Administration Fees  Your employer has to pay the company managing the 401k for their services. It is likely that their agreement with the management company requires them to pay on a monthly basis, so it potentially makes things convenient for the accounting people on both ends if theres a steady monthly flow of money in and out. Whether this point is at all relevant is very much dependent on how your companys agreement is structured, and how well the folks handling payroll and accounting understand it. The Bottom Line  Your employer let us hope makes profits. And they pay expenses. And companies, for a variety of financial reasons, prefer to spread their profits and expenses as evenly over the year as they can. There are a lot of ways they achieve this  for example, a seasonal business might offer an annual payment plan to spread their seasonal revenue over the year. Likewise, the matching funds they are paying to you the employees are coming out of their bottom line. And the company would rather not have the majority of those funds being disbursed in a single quarter. They want a nice, even distribution. So once again it behooves them to create a 401k system that supports that objective. To Sum Up Ultimately, those 401k matching funds are a carrot. And that carrot manipulates you the employee into behaving in a way that is good for your employer, good for your investment management company, and good for your own investment success. Unless you are one of the rare birds who can outperform a dollarcostaveraged investment in a lowcost index fund, theres very little to chafe at about this arrangement. If you are that rare bird, then your investment earning power likely outstrips the value of your annual matching monies significantly, in which case it isnt even worth thinking about.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

How to minimize damage from sale of savings account,"Bank of America has been selling off their local branches to smaller banks in recent years. Here are a few news stories related to this Along with the branch buildings, the local customers savings and checking accounts are sold to the new bank. It is interesting that you were told that your savings account is being sold, but that your checking account will remain with BofA. I guess it depends on the terms of the particular sale. Here are your options, as I see it Let the savings account move to the new bank, and see what the new terms are like. You might actually like the new bank. If you dont, you can shop around and close your account at the new bank after it has been created. Close your account now, before the move. If you have a different bank youd like to move to, there is no need to wait. Since your checking account is apparently staying with BofA, you could move all your money from your savings account to your checking account, closing your savings account. Then after ""mid August"" when the local branch switches to the new bank and everyone elses savings account has moved, you can call up BofA and tell them you want to move some of the money from your checking account into a new savings account. If you really have your heart set on staying with BofA, option 3 looks like a good, easy choice. To address your other concerns Bank of America is a big credit card company, so I doubt that your credit card is being sold off. Your credit card account should stay asis. Even if your savings account and checking account are at a different bank, there is no need to switch credit cards. Your savings and checking accounts have nothing to do with your credit report or score, so there is no concern there. If you end up wanting to switch to a new credit card with a different bank, there are minor hits to your credit score involved with applying for a new card and closing your current card, but if I were you I would not worry about your credit score in this. Switch credit cards if you want a change, and keep your credit card if you dont.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How to minimize damage from sale of savings account?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What are the alternatives to compound interest for a Muslim?,"Because so many businesses make some money through some form of compound interest, like a business that saves its earnings in a business account that pays interest, it heavily depends on how strict you interpret this law. Some Muslims I know interpret it to mean directly and indirectly, while for some its just direct interest earned. What I would suggest is either a direct investment in agriculture or a share in agriculture, where you are directly paid from your share in the investment and not through money that comes from a bank account earning interest. If you do a direct investment in agriculture, like owning livestock, you will be paid money in the form of food, which compounds through reproduction and can sell the offspring to others and collect the money. Year to date, agriculture is crushing the SP 500 and many places around the world are facing shortages in food, like sugar and corn. If you dont have enough money for a direct investment, you can try the share route where you own a share of a direct investment. Rather than go through stock exchanges, where many of these companies make money indirectly through interest also, you can negotiate directly with farmers, ranchers, livestock owners, etc. Some of these individuals are looking to diversify their money, so they may be willing to let you own a fraction of what they produce and pay you directly. All of this comes with risk, of course. Livestock and plants die for a variety of reasons, but none of it will be interest from lending whether to individuals or through a bank. In addition, if we experience very high inflation in the future, livestock and plants do very well in this environment.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are the alternatives to compound interest for a Muslim?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

US sanctions against foreign citizens ,"Are most big US based financial institutions and banks in such a close relationship with USCIS United States Citizenship And Immigration Services so they can easily request the information about market traders? Yes. They must be in order to enforce the laws required by the sanctions. What online broker would you suggest that probably wont focus on that dual citizenship matter? ""Dual"" citizenship isnt actually relevant here. Nearly anyone in the world can invest in US banks except for those few countries that the US has imposed sanctions against. Since you are a citizen of one of those countries, you are ineligible to participate. The fact that you are also a US citizen isnt relevant in this case. I believe the reasoning behind this is that the US doesnt encourage dual citizenship The U.S. Government does not encourage dual nationality. While recognizing the existence of dual nationality and permitting Americans to have other nationalities, the U.S. Government also recognizes the problems which it may cause. Claims of other countries upon U.S. dualnationals often place them in situations where their obligations to one country are in conflict with the laws of the other. In addition, their dual nationality may hamper efforts of the U.S. Government to provide consular protection to them when they are abroad, especially when they are in the country of their second nationality. If I had to guess, Id say the thinking there is that if you and enough other people that are citizens of that country want to participate in something in the US that sanctions forbid, you collectively could try to persuade that countrys government to change its actions so that the sanctions are lifted. Alternatively, you could renounce your citizenship in the other country. Either of those actions would help further the cause that the US perceives to be correct. What it basically boils down to is that even though you are a US citizen, your rights can be limited due to having another citizenship in a country that is not favorable in the current political climate. Thus there are pros and cons to having dual citizenship.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: US sanctions against foreign citizens?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Renting or Buying an House,"You may be in a situation where buying is preferred, especially because you can enter the market in a strong position  with a 20 down payment. If you have the financial ability to assume the risk of owning, you may be better off. I would consider two things. Renting is purchasing a service. You are buying the flexibility to move with minimum hassle and the landlord is assuming the risk of owning the asset property. They will make money on you, like any service provider. Buying is purchasing an asset. You are buying the underlying asset and assume all the risks associated with it. This is large, unforeseen maintenance, fees, taxes, depreciation, etc... Some of these risks were passed to you as a renter, but some were not. Just like purchasing 400k in stock, if you have to sell when the market is down, you lose big. You win if you can hold. Unlike a stock, real estate will eat your cash in taxes and repairs unless it is rented. If you are willing to be a longdistance landlord, this may work out. Understand that property management fees will eat into your rent income and being longdistance will give more potential for a bad tenant to ruin your property value. These and other factors e.g. vacancy rate will increase your risk of loss and should be considered. Some of this will be your preference, since you will spend much more time dealing with buyingsellingproperty management as opposed to a more clean rental situation. Is this hassle worth the savings? For many, yes others, no.

Stop paying VAT on digital sales when earnings are under 81k,"You cant currently avoid it. The reason the legislation was introduced was to prevent the bigname developers from setting up shop in a lowVAT country and selling apps to citizens of EU countries that would normally be paying a much higher VAT. You need to register for VAT and file quarterly nilreturns so that you get that money back. Its a hassle, but probably worth it just to recoup those funds. From an article in Kotaku from late 2014 You see, in the UK we have a rather sensible exemption on VAT for businesses that earn under 81,000 a year. This allows people to run small businesses  like making and selling games in your spare time, for instance  without the administrative nightmare of registering as a business and paying VAT on sales. Unfortunately, none of the other EU member states had an exemption like this, so when the new legislation was being put together, there was no exemption factored in. That means that if someone makes even 1 from selling something digital to another person in another EU country, they now have to be VAT registered in the UK AND they have to pay tax on that sale at whatever rate the buyers country of residence has set. That could be 25 in Sweden, 21 in the Netherlands, and so on. [...] Theres one piece of good news even though anyone who sells digital stuff now has to be VATregistered in the UK, they dont actually have to pay VAT on sales to people in the UK if they earn less than 81,000 from it. This concession was achieved earlier this month after extensive lobbying. But theyll still have to submit whats called a nilreturn, which is essentially a tax return with nothing on it, every quarter in order to use the VAT MOSS service. Thats a lot of paperwork. Obviously Brexit may have a significant impact on all this, so the rules might change. This is the official Google Link to how theyve implemented this and for which countries it affects httpssupport.google.comgoogleplayandroiddeveloperanswer138000?hlen Due to VAT laws in the European Union EU, Google is responsible for determining, charging, and remitting VAT for all Google Play Store digital content purchases by EU customers.

How exactly does dealing in stock make me money?,"Generally, a share of stock entitles the owner to all future pershare dividends paid by the company, plus a fraction of the companys assets net value in the event of liquidation. If one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts, the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream, which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts. As time goes by, the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid, whereupon it will cease to contribute to the stocks value. Because people are not clairvoyant, they generally dont know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make. A sane price for a stock, however, may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments. If unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward, the price of the stock should increase. If events cause estimates to be revised downward, the price should fall. In a sane marketplace, if the price of a stock is below peoples estimates of its payouts current cash value, people should buy the stock and push the price upward. If it is above peoples estimates, they should sell the stock and push the price downward. Note that in a sane marketplace, rising prices are a redflag indicator for people to stop buying. Unfortunately, sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead. When that happens, prices may soar through the roof, but its important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts. If that value is 10share, someone who buys a share for 50 basically gives the seller 40 that he was not entitled to, and which the buyer will never get back. The buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him 60 for the share, but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one 50 that he wasnt entitled to either. If the price falls back to 10, calling that fall a ""market correction"" wouldnt be a euphemism, but rather state a fact the share was worth 10 before people sold it for crazy prices, and still worth 10 afterward. It was the market price that was in error. The important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in. Its not necessary to look only at present priceearnings ratios, since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year. Whats important, however, is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How exactly does dealing in stock make me money?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Which dividend bearing stock should be chosen by price?,"Price doesnt mean anything. Price is simply total value market capitalization divided by number of shares. Make sure you consider historical dividends when hunting for big yields. Its very possible that the data youre pulling is only the annualized yield on the most recent dividend payment.

Companies rarely probably never but rarely to avoid the peanut gallery comments about the one company that does this decide dividend payments based on some proportion of the stock price.

Some investors may want to eventually own the Admiral Shares fund but do not yet have 10K.

How can I cash out a check internationally?,"Your friend probably cannot deposit the check to your U.S. bank account.

Whats the difference when asked for debit or credit by a store when using credit and debit cards?,"Im surprised by all the procredit answers here, debit has some definite advantages. Most importantly, when you pay with a credit card, the merchant pays around 3 of the transaction to the credit company. In many states, they are forced to charge you the same amount, and this is frequently toted as consumer protection. But consider what this means for the business they loose money for every credit transaction, and theyre legally forbidden to do anything about it. So youre taking 3 from a business and handing it over to a massive cooperation. To make matters worse, the buisness is inevitably going to have to raise their prices albiet by a small amount, so in the end the average consumer has gained nothing. On the other hand, the credit card company wins big, and they use their profits to pay lobbyists and lawyers to keep these rules in place. To put in the worst possible light, its essentially legal extortion, verging on corruption. As for the fraud protection offered, while it may be true that credit cards will offer a more hasslefree reimbursement i.e. you just dont have to pay the bill if your card is stolen, consumer protection laws also extend to debit in many cases your bank is legally required to cut you a check for all the money you lost.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Whats the difference when asked for debit or credit by a store when using credit and debit cards?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Suitable Vanguard funds for a shortterm goal 12 years,"If you want to invest in the stock market, whether over a shorter period of 1 to 2 years or over a longer period of 10 or 20 years or longer you need to take some precautions and have a written investment plan with a risk management strategy incorporated in your plan. Others have said that 1 to 2 years is too short to invest in the stock market as the stock market can have a correction and fall by 50. But it doesnt matter if you invest for 1 year or if you invest for 50 years, the stock market can still fall by 50 just before you plan to withdraw your funds. What you need to figure out is a way to get out before the market falls by 40 to 50. A simple way to do this is to use technical indicators to warn you when a market trend is starting to change and that it is time to get out of the market. Two simple indicators you can use on a market index are the Rate of Change ROC indicator and the 100 week Moving Average MA. Below is a 10 year weekly chart of the SP500 with these two indicators charted. They show good times to get into the market and good times to get out. If you are using the 100 week MA you would buy in when the price crosses above the MA line and sell when the price crosses below the MA line. If you are using the ROC indicator you would buy in when the ROC indicator crosses above the zero line and sell when the ROC indicator crosses below the zero line. So your investment plan could be to buy an Index ETF representing the SP500 when the ROC moves above zero and sell when it crosses below zero. You can also place a trailing stop loss of 10 to protect you in case of a sudden fall over a couple of days. You can manage your investments in as little as 10 minutes per week by checking the chart once per week and adjusting your stop loss order. If you want to progressively add to your investment each month you could check the charts and only add any new funds if both the ROC is above zero and sloping upwards. Another option for adding new funds could be if the price is above the MA and moving further away from the MA. All these rules should be incorporated into your investment plan so that you are not basing your decisions based on emotions. There are many other Technical Analysis Indicators you could also learn about to make better educated decisions about your stock market investments. However, what I have provided here is enough for anyone to test over different indexes and time frames and do their own paper trading on to gain some confidence before placing any real money on the table.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Suitable Vanguard funds for a shortterm goal 12 years?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

United Kingdom Where to save money for a property deposit,"From April 2017 the plan is that there is now also going to be a ""Lifetime ISA"" in addition to the Help to Buy ISA. Assuming those plans do not change, they government will give 25 after each year until you are 50, and the maximum you can put in per year will be 4000. Catches You can only take the money out for certain ""life events"", currently Buying a house below 450000 anywhere in the country not just London. Passing 60 years of age. If you take it out before or for another reason, you lose the government bonus plus 5, ie. it currently looks like you will be left with 95 of the total of the money you paid in. You cannot use the bonus payments from this one together with bonus payments from a Help to Buy ISA to buy a home. However you can transfer an existing Help to Buy ISA into this one come 2017. While you are not asking about pensions, it is worth mentioning for other readers that while 25 interest per year sounds great, if you use it for pension purposes, consider that this is after tax, so if you pay mostly 20 tax on your income the difference is not that big and if your employer matches your contributions up to a point, then it may not be worth it. If you pay a significant amount of tax at 40 or higher, then it may not make sense for pension purposes. Tax bands and the ""rates"" on this ISA may change, of course. On the other hand, if you intend to use the money for a houseflat purchase in 2 or more years time, then it would seem like a good option. For you specifically This ""only"" covers 4000 per year, ie. not the full amount you talked about, but it is likely a good idea for you to spread things out anyway. That way, if one thing turns out to be not as good as other alternatives it has less impact  it is less likely that all your schemes will turn out to be bad luck. Within the M25 the 450000 limit may restrict you to a small house or flat in 510 years time. Again, prices may stall as they seem barely sustainable now.

Is giving my girlfriend money for her mortgage closing costs and down payment considered fraud?,"With the standard ""I am not a lawyer"" disclaimer, consider this question If you and your girlfriend split up sometime after purchasing the house but before getting married, would you expect her to repay you for the closing costs and downpayment? That is, if you write her a check for 5k, and 6 months after she signs the papers for the house one of you decides to break up with the other, would you expect her to write you a check for 5k in return? That is the difference between ""a gift"" and ""a loan disguised as a gift"". If the answer is no, you dont expect it back, then everything is fine and youre in the clear  its perfectly legal to give someone money. If the answer is yes, you would want to be ""paid back"", then its not a gift and you run the risk of running afoul of the regulations. With respect to a previous answer about ""gifting money that is not taxed"", in the US one person can give another up to 14,000 without worrying about gift taxes, and even in the event that you exceed that amount, the excess would simply eat into the lifetime exemption of 5,250,000. Individual states may have different rules and exempt amounts that would apply to state taxes. Please also consider the income issue for your ""rental agreement"". Your GF would be expected to declare that amount and pay income tax on it as a business. She might also declare part of that amount as expected income for purposes of securing the loan, but that may run into its own issues youre not a roommate, and presumably the home is not a duplex or set up as apartments, and presumably she would not offer a similar deal to someone other than you.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is giving my girlfriend money for her mortgage closing costs and down payment considered fraud?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Can I withdraw from my Roth IRA retirement account to fund a startup?,"Yes, it is possible to withdraw money from your Roth IRA before retirement but I wouldnt necessarily advise you to do so. Heres the good news, and the bad news The good news Unlike a traditional IRA, money contributed to a Roth IRA is done so on an aftertax basis, meaning you dont benefit from a tax deduction on contributions. So, the money you withdraw from your Roth IRA will not be taxed entirely as ordinary income. In fact, you are allowed to withdraw the amount of your original contributions also known as basis without any taxes or penalties. Lets imagine you originally deposited 9000 of that current 10K total value  then in such a case, 9000 could be withdrawn tax and penalty free. The bad news When it comes to the investment earnings  the other 1000 in my example  its a different story Since you wouldnt be age 59 12 at the time of withdrawal, any money taken out beyond your original contributions would be considered a nonqualified withdrawal and subject to both ordinary income taxes plus a 10 early withdrawal penalty. Ouch! Perhaps you might want to restrict your withdrawal to your original contributions. I would imagine if youve had the account for such a short period of time that much or all of your account value is original contributions anyway. A good article about the rules for early IRA withdrawals is About.coms Tax Penalty for Early Distribution of Retirement Funds. Note If your Roth IRA funds were the result of a rollover from another account type, other rules may apply. See Roth IRA Wikipedia for more detail search for ""rollover"".

Cons of withdrawing money from an Roth IRA account?,"In a year with no income, the best advice is to convert existing IRA money to Roth.

What is the purpose of property tax?,"Property taxes are levied by the local authorities to pay for their services. Since the services are continuous  so are the charges.

However, at times the property taxes become more than what the owners have actually paid for the house. Think of a house bought in the midst of a recession at a bargain price of 20K, but at the top of the market bubble costs 2M. The poor guy who bought it for 20K should pay as if he had ever had 2M?

Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses,"For simplicity, lets start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable sort of, Ill explain later. The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars you typically arent deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs 100 and you receive 2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid 98 for that item but that wouldnt affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same 100 deduction would have only been a 98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the 2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that 2 as income though that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions Part 1 As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counteracted by the ""refund"" you receive for the payments. Part 2 Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewardspointscashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a ""dont ask, dont tell"" rule that the IRS is OK with. It works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline miles the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income. However, I would not go out of my way to abuse this ""loophole"". Typically, things like travel airfare, hotel, car rental, meals are expected. But I wouldnt go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you. The company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received. Or more realistically, negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check. Part 3 Would there be any difference between credit card points and brandloyalty points? If the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car companys loyalty system not a CC, would that yield a different result? There is no difference. Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur. In other words, the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement. This is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity, you cant call that a ""donation"" of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement. Instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work, and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them, but it ends up being a wash.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Using credit card points to pay for tax deductible business expenses?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do 1099 forms take so long for brokerages to prepare and send out?,"There are probably many correct answers to this question, but for most people, the main reason is qualified dividends. To be a qualified dividend and therefore eligible for lower tax rates, the dividendpaying stock or fund must be held for ""more than 60 days during the 121day period that begins 60 days before the exdividend date"". Since many stocks and funds pay out dividends at the end of the year, that means it takes until mid to late February to determine if you held them, and therefore made the dividend qualified.

Is it smart to only invest in mid and smallcap stock equity funds in my 401k?,"The benefit of the 401K and IRAs are that reallocating and re balancing are easy. They dont want you to move the funds every day, but you are not locked in to your current allocations. The fact that you mentioned in a comment that you also have a Roth IRA means that you should look at all retirements as a whole. Look at what options you have in the 401K and also what options you have with the IRA. Then determine the overall allocation between bonds, stocks, international, REIT, etc. Then use the mix of funds in the IRA and 401K to meet that goal. Asking if the 401K should be small and mid cap only cant be answered without knowing not just your risk tolerances but the total money in the 401K and IRA.

Why would someone want to sell call options?,"You appear to be thinking of option writers as if they were individuals with small, nondiversified, holdings and a particular view on what the underlying is going to do. This is not the best way to think about them. Option writers are typically large institutions with large portfolios and that provide services in all sorts of different areas. At the same time as they are writing calls on a particular stock, they are writing puts on it and options on other stocks. They are buying and selling the underlying and all kinds of different derivatives. They are not necessarily writing the option because they are expecting or hoping to benefit from a price move. Its just small part of their business. They write the option if the option price is good enough that they think they are selling it for very slightly more than its worth. Asking why an option writer creates a call is like asking why a grocery store keeps buying groceries from their distributors. Dont they know the price of food may not always rise? Sure, but their business is selling the food for slightly more than they pay for it, not speculating on what will happen to its price. Most option writers are doing the same thing, except what they are buying and selling is sets of cash flows and risk. As a general rule, the business model of option writers is to profit from the few cents of spread or mispricing, not from aggregate changes in the price of the underlying. They should and often do maintain balanced portfolios so their option writing activities dont expose them to a lot of risk. Also note that there could be lots of reasons for writing options, even if you do have a particular view. For example, perhaps the option writer thinks volatility of the underlying will decrease. Writing a call could be part of an overall strategy that profits from this view.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why would someone want to sell call options?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does one value Facebook stock as a potential investment?,"In the long term, a PE of 1525 is the more normal range. With a 90 PE, Facebook has to quadruple its earnings to get to normal. It this possible? Yes. Likely? I dont know. I am not a stock analyst, but I love numbers and try to get to logical conclusions. Ive seen data that worldwide advertising is about 400B, and US about 100B. If Facebooks profit runs 25 or so and I want a PE of 20, it needs profit of 5B on sales of 20B to reconcile its current 100B market cap. No matter what FB growth in sales is, the advertising spent worldwide will not rise or fall by much more than the economy. So with a focus on ads, they would need about 5 of the world market to grow into a comfortable PE. Flipping this around, if all advertising were 25 profit a crazy assumption, there are 100B in profit to be had world wide each year, and the value of the companies might total 2T in aggregate. The above is a rambling sharing of the reasonable bounds one might expect in analyzing a stock. It can be used for any otherwise finite market, such as soft drinks. There are only so many people on the planet, and in aggregate, the total soft drink consumption cant exceed, say 6 billion gallons per day.

Company revenue increased however stock price did not,"Note that we do not comment on specific stocks here, and have no place doing so. If your question is only about that specific stock then it is off topic. I have not tried to answer that part below. The key to valuation is predicting the net present value of all of a companys cash flows i.e. of their future profits and losses. Through a number of methods to long to explain here investment banks and hedge funds work out what they expect the companys cash flows to be and trade so that these future profits, losses etc. are priced into the stock price. Since future cash flows, profits or whatever you want to call them are priced in, the price of a stock shouldnt move at all on an earnings statement. This begs the question ""why do some stock prices move violently when they announce earnings?"" The models that the institutional investors use are not perfect and cannot take into account everything. An unexpected craze for a product or a supply chain agreement breaking down on not being as good as it seems will not be factored into this pricing and so the price will move based on the degree to which expectation is missed or exceeded. Since penny socks are speculative their value is based far more on the long term expected cash flows and less on the short run cash flows. This goes a long way to explaining why some of the highest market capitalisation penny stocks are those making consistent losses. This means that they can be far less susceptible to price movements after an earnings announcement even if it is well out of the consensus range. Higher potential future value comes with the higher risks of penny stocks which discounts current value. In the end if peoples expectation of the companys performance reflects reality then the profitability is priced in and there will be no price movement. If the actuality is outside of the expected range then there will be a price movement.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Company revenue increased however stock price did not?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Im thinking of getting a new car  why shouldnt I LEASE one?,"You SHOULDNT lease one if you are going to get an economy car, if you dont drive too much 15K  year, and you want to hang on to the car for a long time. Otherwise, if you are a regular driver, driving a leased new quality car can be cost effective. Many cars now have bumpertobumper warranties that last as long as the lease say 80K. So there is rarely any extra costs apart from regular maintenance. The sweet spot for most new cars is in the 5th, 6th, or 7th years, after they are paid off. But at that point, you may find you have maintenance bills that are approaching an average of 200  300 per month. In which case, a lease starts to look pretty good. I owned a 7 year old Honda Accord that cost only 80 less per month in maintenance than the new leased VW that replaced it. Havent looked back after that.

"Is it better for a public company to increase its dividends, or institute a share buyback?","In some sense, the share repurchasing program is better if the company does not foresee the same profit levels down the road. Paying a dividend for several years and then suddenly not paying or reducing a dividend is viewed as a ""slap in the face"" by investors. Executing a share repurchase program one year and then not the next is not viewed as negatively. From an investors standpoint, I would say a dividend is preferred over a share repurchase program for a similar reason. Typically companies that pay a dividend have been doing so for quite some time and even increasing it over time as the company increases profits. So, it can be assumed that if a company starts paying a dividend, it will do so for the longrun.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is it better for a public company to increase its dividends, or institute a share buyback?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?,"First, the limit this year is 16,500, 22,000 for age 50 or older. Next, does the company give you any match? If so, how much? Some will match your deposits dollar for dollar up to a certain percent of your pay. If you make 50k and deposit say 6, thats 3k matched by company, for example. This depositmatch is the first priority. Next, you should understand the expenses in the account. A bad 401k with high cost quickly negates any tax deferral benefit. The 401k options also may be limited, what are the choices of investments? Is your income high enough that you can save 21,500? One thought is to save enough to drop back out of the 25 bracket, and go Roth after that. This is a good balance for most. By the way, Fairmark is a great site to see what bracket you are in. If your return is simple, you can just find your standard deduction and exemption numbers and get to your taxable income very simply. The debate of of Roth vs Pretax for both IRA and 401k accounts can get pretty complex, but I found the majority of earners falling into the ""live in the 15 bracket, tops"" range.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Is there a general guideline for what percentage of a portfolio should be in gold?,"My personal goldmetals target is 5.0 of my retirement portfolio. Right now Im underweight because of the run up in goldmetals prices. I havent been selling, but as I add to retirement accounts, I havent been buying gold so it is going below the 5 mark. I arrived at this number after reading a lot of different sample portfolio allocations, and some books. Some people recommend what I consider crazy allocations 2550 in gold. From what I could figure out in terms of modern portfolio theory, holding some metal reduces your overall risk because it generally has a low correlation to equity markets. The problem with gold is that it is a lousy investment. It doesnt produce any income, and only has costs storage, insurance, commissions to buysell, management of ETF if thats what youre using, etc. The only thing going for it is that it can be a hedge during tough times. In this case, when you rebalance, your gold will be high, youll sell it, and buy the stocks that are down. In theory  assuming you stick to disciplined rebalancing. So for me, 5 seemed to be enough to shave off a little overall risk without wasting too much expense on a hedge.

Why is the highest quintile the only quintile whose wealth exceeds its income? ,"In a business environment, this phenomenon could be easily explained by operational leverage. Operational leverage is the principle that increasing revenues by a small amount can have a disproportionately large impact on net income. Consider this example you run a business that rents out a factory and produces goods to sell to consumers. The rent costs you 10k  month, and all of your other costs depend on how many goods you produce. Assume each good gives you 10 in profit, after factoring your variable costs. If you sell 1,000 units, you breakeven, because your variable profit will pay for your rent. If you sell 1,100 units, you make 1,000 net profit. If you sell 1,200 units, you double your overall profit, making 2,000 for the month. Operational leverage is the principle that adding incremental revenue will have a greater impact than the revenue already received, because your fixed costs are already paid for. Similarly in personal finance, consider these scenarios You have 1,000 in monthly expenses, and make 1,000  your monthly savings and therefore your wealth will be zero. You have 1,000 in monthly expenses, and make 1,100  your monthly savings will be 100 per month. You have 1,000 in monthly expenses, and make 1,200  increasing your income by 10 has allowed your monthly savings double, at 200 per month. You have 1,000 in monthly expenses, and make 2,000  your monthly savings are 5 times higher, when your income only increased by 80. Now in the real world, when someone makes more money, they will increase their expenses. This is because spending money can increase ones quality of life. So the incline does not happen quite so quickly  as pointed out by Pete  quid, there comes a point where increased spending provides someone with less increase in quality of life  at that point, savings really would quickly ramp up as income increases incrementally. But assuming you live the same making 2,000  month as 1,000  month, you can save, every month, a full months worth of living expenses. This doesnt even factor in the impact of earning investment income on those savings. As to why the wealth exceeds income at that specific point, I couldnt say, but what Ive outlined above should show how it is quite reasonable that the data is asreported.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is the highest quintile the only quintile whose wealth exceeds its income?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is the correct answer for percent change when the start amount is zero dollars 0?,"A value of zero or a negative value makes the percent change meaningless. Saying 100 when going from 0 to some other value is simply wrong. I have seen a similar situation several times when looking at a public company with a loss last quarter. On Google Finance or some other service, the PE ratio will be blank, NA, or something like that. If the company does not currently have earnings, then the PE ratio is meaningless. Likewise, if the company previously did not have earnings, then the percent change of the earnings is meaningless. Also consider the example where the previous value was negative. If the previous value was negative 1 and the current value is positive 99, then this happens A negative change? But the value went up!

How will a 1099 work with an existing W2?,"You can do either a 1099 or a W2. There is no limitations to the number of W2s one can have in reporting taxes. Problems occur, with the IRS, when one ""forgets"" to report income. Even if one holds only one job at a time, people typically have more than one W2 if they change jobs within the year. The W2 is the simplest way to go and you may want to consider doing this if you do not intend to work this side business into significant income. However, a 1099 gig is preferred by many in some situations. For things like travel expenses, you will probably receive the income from these on a 1099, but you can deduct them from your income using a Schedule C. Along these lines you may be able to deduct a wide variety of other things like travel to and from the clients location, equipment such as computers and office supplies, and maybe a portion of your home internet bill. Also this opens up different retirement contributions schemes such as a simplified employee pension. This does come with some drawbacks, however. First your life is more complicated as things need to be documented to become actual business expenses. You are much more likely to be audited by the IRS. Your taxes become more complicated and it is probably necessary to employee a CPA to do them. If you do this for primary full time work you will have to buy your own benefits. Most telling you will have to pay both sides of social security taxes on most profits. Keep in mind that a good account can help you transfer profits to dividends which will allow you to be taxed at 15 and avoid social security taxes. So it really comes down to what you see this side gig expanding into and your goals. If you want to make this a real business, then go 1099, if you are just doing this for a fes months and a few thousand dollars, go W2.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How will a 1099 work with an existing W2?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do stocks tend to trade at high volumes at the end of or start the trading day?,"The shift to trading at the close began in 2008. Traders did not want to be caught off guard by surprise news and there was a lot of volatility during the financial crisis, so they would close their position in the evening. Thats how it began. There are two reasons why it sticks around. First, there has been an increase usage of index funds or passive funds. These funds tend to update their positions at the end of the day. From the WSJ Another factor behind the shift has been the proliferation of passively managed investments, such as index funds. These funds aim to mimic an index, like the SP 500, by owning the shares that comprise it. Index funds dont trade as often as active investors, but when they do, it is typically near the market close, traders say. That is because buying or selling a stock at its closing price better aligns their performance with the index they are trying to emulate. The second reason is simply that volume attracts volume. As a result of whats mentioned above, you have a shift to end of day trading, and the corrolary to that is that there is a liquidity shortage from 10am to 3pm. Thus, if you want to buy or sell a stock, but there are few buyers or sellers around, you will significant move the price when you enter your order. Obviously this does not affect retail traders, but imagine hedge funds entering or closing a billion dollar position. It can make a huge impact on price. And one way to mitigate that is to wait until there are more market participants to take the other end of your trade, just as at the end of the day. So this is a selfreinforcing trend that has begun in the markets and will likely stick around. httpwww.wsj.comarticlestraderspileinattheclose1432768080",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do stocks tend to trade at high volumes at the end of or start the trading day?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

First time home buyer. How to negotiate price?,"Advice from a longtime flipper You negotiate price based on four factors and none of these are set in stone How much you love the house. Is this house a 100 out of 100 for you or a 85 or a 75. How much have you compromised. What is the likelihood that you will find a house that will make you just as happy or at least close. You might have a house that is a 95 out of 100 but there are five other houses that you rated between 9395. What is your timeframe. Know that playing hardball takes longer and can knock you out of the game sometimes and takes a little while to find a new game. What is the relative housing market. Zillow and other such sites are crap. Yes the give you a generalized feel for a community but their estimates are off sometimes by 3040. Other factors like streetnoiseupdates to house and so on are huge factors. You will have to really navigate the area and look for very comparable houses that have recently sold. Then use average housing movements to extrapolate your future houses cost. As a buyer you have two jobs. Buy the house you want and manage your agent. Your agent wants you to buy a house as soon as possible and to increase their reputation. Those are their only two factors of working. By you offering closer to the asking price they are able to get their sales as quick as possible. Also other agents will love working with them. In fact your agent is selling you on the home and the price. Agents hardly worry about you paying too much  as most buyers oversell the deal they get on their home. Admitting that you paid too much for your house is more of an admission of ignorance of yourself, compared to agent incompetency. If you decide to lowball the owner, your agent spends more time with you and possibly reduces their reputation with the selling agent. So it is common for agents to tell you that you should not offer a low price as you will insult the owner. My advice. Unless the home is truly one of a kind for the market offering anything within 20 of the asking price is DEFINITELY within range. I have offered 40 less. If a house is asking too much and has been on the market for 8 months there is no way I am going in with an offer of even 15 lower. That leaves you no room. What you do? First think about how much you think this house could sell for in the next 3 months. In your example lets say 80K based on conservative comps. Then take the most you would actually pay for it. Lets say 75K. 70K is about as high of an opening offer I would go. Do NOT tell your agent your true breaking points. If you tell your agent that you would go to 75K on the house. Then that is what their negotiations will start at. Remember they want the sale to happen as soon as possible. Very likely the other agent  especially if they know each other  will ask if how flexible you are going to be. Then next thing you know your agent calls you back and says would you be willing to go 77K or the owner is firm at 80K. Do not give up your position. You should never forecast to your agent what your next bid or offer would be for the house. Never get into scenarios or future counters. So you offer 70K. If your agent asks you how firm that is? ""Very firm"". If your agent doesnt want to take the offer to them, ""Thank you for being my agent, but I am going to be working with someone that represents what I want."" If the owner says ""You are done too me cheapskate."" Well thats how it goes. If the owner stays firm at asking or lowers  then you can come up if you feel comfortable doing so. But understand what your goal is. Is it to get a house or to get a good deal on a house? Mine was always to get a good deal on a house. So I might offer 72K next. If they didnt budge, I am out. If they moved down I went from there. Easy Summary The fact is if they arent willing to negotiate with you enough it always ends the same. You give them your takeitorleaveit offer. You tell your agent that if heshe comes back with one penny over it comes from their commission god I have said this 100 times in my life and it is the best negotiation tactic you have with your agent.

Does the rise in ACA premiums affect employerprovided health insurance premiums?,"Its likely impossible to determine why premiums are increasing in a meaningful way not only is the interrelationship between the various data points very complex, but some of the increases are likely due to decisions by people who do not and will not publicly post what they decided and why. However, it is possible to compare health insurance premium increases over time to see if the increases in employersponsored health insurance premiums are comparable or not to the preACA timeframe. Since the ACA phased in over a few years, we can compare the period 20082010 ""preACA"" and 20132015 ""postACA"", ignoring 20112012 as being unclearly affected by the ACA phasein. For this, I will look at single coverage premiums only for the purpose of simplifying the analysis. I found a good table of 20082010 premiums from the NCSL they list the following Kaiser Permanente had a good list for 20132015 here From 20082010, the average growth was around 6 per year. From 20132015, the growth averaged about 3. In both of these cases we are comparing total premiums sum of employer and employee contributions. So, from a datadriven look, it seems that the premium growth is lower postACA than preACA, so its unlikely that the ACA could be accused of causing increased premium growth. Of course, this is USwide average, and on a statebystate basis there may well be significant differences that may or may not be related to the ACA. One thing that is covered on the NCSL page linked above that is interesting while the premium growth has slowed significantly about 50 of the growth preACA, health insurance premiums are a higher proportion of employees wages, and that growth is continuing  because wage growth has not kept pace with inflation post2008 recession. Employee contributions also may be higher postrecession many companies reduced their contribution percentage as my then employer did, for example. Finally, increases in the ACA plans are also commonly overstated. They largely are in line with employer plans or even less. In 2015, premiums were basically flat, decreasing slightly in fact  see the KFF analysis here. 2016 saw a 3.6 by this methodology see the 2016 analysis. Its very easy to cherrypick examples that are favorable to any interpretation from the data, though there are such big swings as a result of the different conditions in the marketplaces that its easy to pick a few that have high swings and claim the ACA has massive premium increases, or pick a few that have low swings and claim its reducing costs.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Does the rise in ACA premiums affect employerprovided health insurance premiums?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do people take out life insurance on their children? Should I take out a policy on my child?,"Why do people take out life insurance on their children? They do so largely because its being sold to them. The insurance companies generally push them on the basis that if you have to pay for a funeral and burial, the cost would devastate a familys finances.

When they sell you a policy they have to dance around a catch22  if you have enough money to afford the cheap life insurance, then you have enough money to pay for a funeral and burial thats probably not going to happen.

Must a company have a specific number of employees to do an IPO?,"Working for a lot of startups, I have seen this cycle. Really it has little to do with making the IPO look good because of number of employees, and is more about making the IPO look good because of planning for the future. Many times an IPO is released, it will be valued at 1.00 made up and the market will soar and spike. Now stock shares are valued at 3.00. Great. Till after the dust settles a bit, and stocks are valued at 0.85. This is ""normal"" and good. It would be better if the stocks ended a little higher than their initial value, but... such is life. Now the initial value of the stock is made up of basically the value of the companys assets, and employees are part of those assets and its earning power. They are also a liability, but that has less impact on initial value than assets. Sales right after IPO are based on how well a company will do. Part of that is growth. So it looks nicer to say ""We have 500 employees and have been growing by 20 per month."" than to say ""We have 100 employees"". In other words, before IPO, employees may be hired to make the company look like it is growing. They may be hired because the budget is projected based on expected growth and expected valuation. After IPO, you get a concrete number. You have your budget. It may be more than you thought, or it may be less. In our example, the real budget from capital, is only 28 of the entire projected budget, and 85 of the initial value. Its time to make some budget cuts. Also, normally, there is a period of adjustment, company wide, as a company goes from VC funding, ""here, have as much money as you want"", to ""real world"" funding, with stricter limits and less wiggle room.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Must a company have a specific number of employees to do an IPO?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it bad practice to invest in stocks that fluctuate by single points throughout the day?,"Yes. There are several downsides to this strategy You arent taking into account commissions. If you pay 5 each time you buy or sell a stock, you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts. This next point sounds obvious, but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit, so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions. Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits. Commissions represent a fixed cost, so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade. Since youre in the US, youre required to follow the SEC rules on pattern day trading. From that link, ""FINRA rules define a pattern day trader as any customer who executes four or more day trades within five business days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customers total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period."" If you trip this rule, youll be required to maintain 25,000 in a margin brokerage account. If you cant maintain the balance, your account will be locked. Dont forget about capital gains taxes. Since youre holding these securities for less than a year, your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. You can deduct your capital losses too assuming you dont repurchase the same security within 30 days, because in that case, the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss, but its important to think about gains and losses in real terms, not nominal terms. The story is different if you make these trades in a taxsheltered account like an IRA, but the other problems still apply. Youre implicitly assuming that the stocks prices are skewed in the positive direction. Remember that you have limit orders placed at the upper and lower bounds of the range, so if the stock price decreases before it increases, your limit order at the lower bound will be triggered and youll trade at a loss. If youre hoping to make a profit through buying low and selling high, you want a stock that hits its upper bound before hitting the lower bound the majority of the time. Unless you have data analysis not just your intuition or a pattern youve talked yourself into from looking at a chart to back this up, youre essentially gambling that more often than not, the stock price will increase before it decreases. Its dangerous to use any strategy that you havent backtested extensively. Find several months or years of historical data, either intraday or daily data, depending on the time frame youre using to trade, and simulate your strategy exactly. This helps you determine the potential profitability of your strategy, and it also forces you to decide on a plan for precisely when you want to invest. Do you invest as soon as the stock trades in a range which algorithms can determine far better than intuition? It also helps you figure out how to manage your risk and how much loss youre willing to accept. For risk management, using limit orders is a start, but see my point above about positively skewed prices. Limit orders arent enough. In general, if an active investment strategy seems like a ""nobrainer"" or too good to be true, its probably not viable. In general, as a retail investor, its foolish to assume that no one else has thought of your simple active strategy to make easy money. I can promise you that someone has thought of it. Trading firms have quantitative researchers that are paid to think of and implement trading strategies all the time. If its viable at any scale, theyll probably already have utilized it and arbitraged away the potential for small traders to make significant gains. Trust me, youre not the first person who thought of using limit orders to make ""easy money"" off volatile stocks. The fact that youre asking here and doing research before implementing this strategy, however, means that youre on the right track. Its always wise to research a strategy extensively before deploying it in the wild. To answer the question in your title, since it could be interpreted a little differently than the body of the question No, theres nothing wrong with investing in volatile stocks, indexes, etc. I certainly do, and Im sure many others on this site do as well. Its not the investing that gets you into trouble and costs you a lot of money its the rapid buying and selling and attempting to time the market that proves costly, which is what youre doing when you implicitly bet that the distribution of the stocks prices is positively skewed. To address the commission fee problem, assuming a fee of 8 per trade ... and a minimum of 100 profit per sale Commissions arent your only problem, and counting on 100 profit per sale is a significant assumption. Look at point 4 above. Through your use of limit orders, youre making the implicit assumption that, more often than not, the price will trigger your upper limit order before your lower limit order. Heres a simple example lets assume you have limit orders placed at 2 and 2 of your purchase price, and that triggering the limit order at 2 earns you 100 profit, while triggering the limit order at 2 incurs a loss of 100. Assume your commission is 5 on each trade. If your upper limit order is triggered, you earn a profit of 100  10  90, then set up the same set of limit orders again. If your lower limit order is triggered this time, you incur a loss of 100  10  110, so your net gain is 90  110  20. This is a perfect example of why, when taking into account transaction costs, even strategies that at first glance seem profitable mathematically can actually fail. If you set up the same situation again and incur a loss again 100  10  110, youre now down 20  110  130. To make a profit, you need to make two profitable trades, without incurring further losses. This is why point 4 is so important. Whenever you trade, its critical to completely understand the risk youre taking and the bet youre actually making, not just the bet you think youre making. Also, according to my ""algorithm"" a sale only takes place once the stock rises by 1 or 2 points otherwise the stock is held until it does. Does this mean youve removed the lower limit order? If yes, then you expose yourself to downside risk. What if the stock has traded within a range, then suddenly starts declining because of bad earnings reports or systemic risks to name a few? If you havent removed the lower limit order, then point 4 still stands. However, I never specified that the trades have to be done within the same day. Let the investor open up 5 brokerage accounts at 5 different firms for safeguarding against being labeled a ""Pattern Day Trader"". Each account may only hold 1 security at any time, for the span of 1 business week. How do you control how long the security is held? Youre using limit orders, which will be triggered when the stock price hits a certain level, regardless of when that happens. Maybe that will happen within a week, or maybe it will happen within the same day. Once again, the bet youre actually making is different from the bet you think youre making. Can you provide some algorithms or methods that do work for generating some extra cash on the side, aside from purchasing SP 500 type index funds and waiting? When I purchase index funds, its not to generate extra liquid cash on the side. I dont invest nearly enough to be able to purchase an index fund and earn substantial dividends. I dont want to get into any specific strategies because Im not in the business of making investment recommendations, and I dont want to start. Furthermore, I dont think explicit investment recommendations are welcome here unless its describing why something is a bad idea, and I agree with that policy. I will make a couple of points, however. Understand your goals. Are you investing for retirement or a shorter horizon, e.g. some side income? You seem to know this already, but I include it for future readers. If a strategy seems too good to be true, it probably is. Educate yourself before designing a strategy. Research fundamental analysis, different types of orders e.g., so you fully understand that you dont have control over when limit orders are executed, different sectors of the market if thats where your interests lie, etc. Personally, I find some sectors fascinating, so researching them thoroughly allows me to make informed investment decisions as well as learn about something that interests me. Understand your limits. How much money are you willing to risk and possibly lose? Do you have a risk management strategy in place to prevent unexpected losses? What are the costs of the risk management itself? Backtest, backtest, backtest.

What are my options to deal with Student Loan debt collectors?,"You should hire a lawyer. The fact that they told you your personal information shows that they actually had it, and are not imposters, which is a good thing. The fact that they mislead you means that their intentions are not pure which is not surprising coming from a collection agency of course. When dealing with collections or any matter of significance for that matter, dont rely on their recording of the call, because they can always conveniently lose it. Make sure to write down every single detail discussed, including the date and time of the call, and the IDname of the person on the other side. If possible  make your own recording notifying them of it of course. Its too late to record the calls now, but do try to reconstruct as much information as possible to provide to your lawyer to deal with it. In the end of the day they will either provide you with the recording and then you might be surprised to hear that what they said was not in fact what you thought they said, and it was just your wishful thinking, it is very possible to be indeed the case, or claim ""we lost it"" and then it will be a problem to either of you to prove who said what, but theyll have the better hand having better lawyers in convincing the court that youre the one trying to avoid paying your debts.

How to calculate how much house I can afford?,"Fundamentals Then remember that you want to put 20 or more down in cash, to avoid PMI, and recalculate with thatmajor chunk taken out of your savings. Many banks offer calculators on their websites that can help you run these numbers and figure out how much house a given mortgage can pay for. Remember that the old advice that you should buy the largest house you can afford, or the newer advice about ""starter homes"", are both questionable in the current market.  Added If youre willing to settle for a ruleofthumb firstapproximation ballpark estimate Maximum mortgage payment Rule of 28. Your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 28 percent of your gross monthly income your income before taxes are taken out. Maximum housing cost Rule of 32. Your total housing payments including the mortgage, homeowners insurance, and private mortgage insurance [PMI], association fees, and property taxes should not exceed 32 percent of your gross monthly income. Maximum Total Debt Service Rule of 40. Your total debt payments, including your housing payment, your auto loan or student loan payments, and minimum credit card payments should not exceed 40 percent of your gross monthly income. As I said, many banks offer webbased tools that will run these numbers for you. These are rules that the lending industy uses for a quick initial screen of an application. They do not guarantee that you in particular can afford that large a loan, just that it isnt so bad that they wont even look at it. Note that this is all in terms of mortgage paymennts, which means its also affected by what interest rate you can get, how long a mortgage youre willing to take, and how much you can afford to pull out of your savings. Also, as noted, if you cant put 20 down from savings the bank will hit you for PMI. Standard reminder Unless you explect to live in the same place for five years or more, buying a house is questionable financially. There is nothing wrong with renting depending on local housing stock it may be cheaper. Houses come with ongoung costs and hassles rental  even renting a house  doesnt. Buy a house only when it makes sense both financially and in terms of what you actually need to make your life pleasant.

What would I miss out on by self insuring my car?,"Insurance is to mitigate risk you cant handle yourself. All insurance, not just car insurance. The expected value of the insurance will always cost more than the expected value of your loss, thats how the insurance company makes money. But sometimes the known fixed cost is better for your ability to sleep at night than the unknown though likely lower variable cost. If you were suddenly hit with a bill the size of your car tomorrow, would you be ok? If so, then you can handle the risk yourself and dont need insurance. If not, then you need the insurance. The insurance company sells thousands of policies and its much easier to predict the number out of 1000 people that will get in an accident tomorrow than the chance that you specifically will get in an accident tomorrow. So they can manage the risk by making a small amount of money from 9991000 people and buying the other guy a new car.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What would I miss out on by self insuring my car?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Long story short, it is an insurance policy against the possibility that the person selling the property to you doesnt legally own it. If there was some mistake or fraud along the way the proper owner could theoretically repossess the property without you getting your money back. If you are financing the property, it is almost a certainty that the lender will require you to buy it whether you want it or not.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is title insurance, and should I get title insurance for my home?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Where should I invest my savings?,"Basically the first thing you should do before you invest your money is to learn about investing and learn about what you want to invest in. Another thing to think about is that usually low risk can also mean low returns. As you are quite young and have some savings put aside you should generally aim for higher risk higher return investments and then when you start to reach retirement age aim for less risky lower return investments. In saying that, just because an investment is considered high risk does not mean you have to be exposed to the full risk of that investment. You do this by managing your risk to an acceptable level which will allow you to sleep at night. To do this you need to learn about what you are investing in. As an example about managing your risk in an investment, say you want to invest 50,000 in shares. If you put the full 50,000 into one share and that share price drops dramatically you will lose a large portion of your money straight away. If instead you spent a maximum of 10,000 on 5 different shares, even if one of them falls dramatically, you still have another 4 which may be doing a lot better thus minimising your losses. To take it one step further you might say if anyone of the shares you bought falls by 20 then you will sell those shares and limit your losses to 2000 per share. If the worst case scenario occurred and all 5 of your shares fell during a stock market crash you would limit your total losses to 10,000 instead of 50,000. Most successful investors put just as much if not more emphasis on managing the risk on their investments and limiting their losses as they do in selecting the investments. As I am not in the US, I cannot really comment whether it is the right time to buy property over there, especially as the market conditions would be different in different states and in different areas of each state. However, a good indication of when to buy properties is when prices have dropped and are starting to stabilise. As you are renting at the moment one option you might want to look at is buying a place to live in so you dont need to rent any more. You can compare your current rent payment with the mortgage payment if you were to buy a house to live in. If your mortgage payments are lower than your rent payments then this could be a good option. But whatever you do make sure you learn about it first. Make sure you spend the time looking at for sale properties for a few months in the area you want to buy before you do buy. This will give you an indication of how much properties in that area are really worth and if prices are stable, still falling or starting to go up. Good luck, and remember, research, research and more research. Even if you are to take someone elses advice and recommendations, you should learn enough yourself to be able to tell if their advice and recommendations make sense and are right for your current situation.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Where should I invest my savings?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What to do with a 50K inheritance [duplicate],"The basic optimization rule on distributing windfalls toward debt is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first putting any extra money into that debt while making minimum payments to the other creditors. If the 5k in ""other debt"" is credit card debt it is virtually certain to be the highest interest rate debt. Pay it off immediately. Dont wait for the next statement. Once you are paying on credit cards there is no grace period and the sooner you pay it the less interest you will accrue. Second, keep 10k for emergencies but pretend you dont have it. Keep your spending as close as possible to what it is now. Check the interest rate on the auto loan v student loans. If the auto loan is materially higher pay it off, then pay the remaining 20k toward the student loans. Added this comment about credit with a view towards the OPs future Something to consider for the longer term is getting your credit situation set up so that should you want to buy a new car or a home a few years down the road you will be paying the lowest possible interest. You can jump start your credit by taking out one or two secured credit cards from one of the banks that will, in a few years, unsecure your account, return your deposit, and leave no trace you ever opened a secured account. Thats the route I took with Citi and Wells Fargo. While over spending on credit cards can be tempting, they are, with a solid payment history, the single most important positive attribute on a credit report and impact FICO scores more than other type of credit or debt. So make an absolute practice of only using them for things you would buy anyway and always, always, pay each monthly bill in full. This one thing will make it far easier to find a good rental, buy a car on the best terms, or get a mortgage at good rates. And remember Credit is not equal to debt.

How to incentivize a realestate broker to find me a cheap house,"Having just gone through this process as a buyer via broker in Israel, here are my thoughts Tldr An incentive such as you are suggesting would not be particularly helpful. In this case, your best option is to spend your efforts shopping for a broker that you can trust. The rest Your main concern is that the broker will find you a place at the top of your budget and will not negotiate aggressively. The main person responsible for negotiation is YOU. You are paying for the property, and you are putting in bids not your agent. The agent should advise you, but in the end should pass along your bids directly. The real problem is that you, as the buyer, generally do not have as close a feel for the pulse of the market as the broker, who should be quite aware of recent closings in the neighborhood. Therefore, there are a few things that you can do to help arm yourself At the end of the day, if you have decided to use a broker, you are making a large financial commitment to hire someone to find you the best place, and therefore it may be more important at this point to spend your efforts shopping around for the best broker, rather than trying to figure out how to outsmart her. You are correct buyers agents DO have incentives to sell you on places that may not be right or good for you. For example Although your scheme may help a bit with the first concern, it will not help at all with the other two, which I assume to be much more likely problems in any event. Instead, find recommendations for brokers from others. Have the broker show you a few properties and put in some low bids to get a feel for how she handles them. Discuss the properties together and try to assess if they really have your interests in mind. You are paying a lot for their service, and you should make sure, as much as possible, that they really are working honestly and in your best interest. A good broker who knows his market and is trying to help you can be a great asset in the opaque, cutthroat real estate market.  ,  .    ,          .

Are REIT worth it and is it a good option to generate passive income for a while?,"In financial markets, the gains you can expect to make whether in the form of dividends or capital gains correspond to the risks you are bearing. There are a variety of REITs but you can expect to make only as much money in them as you bear risk meaning you can also lose a lot of money in the ones that earn a lot. In that sense they are just like other financial assets like stocks. If you are generically trying to increase your wealth by bearing risk, you can get a better riskreward ratio in a fully diversified portfolio including stocks and bonds as well and REITs. ""Passive income"" means making money by bearing risk. REITs alone, without diversifying into other financial assets, do a poor job of generating income for the amount of risk you bear. So why are REITs not very comparable to buying a house and renting it out? Because in the latter case you are being paid not only for bearing the risk of the house depreciating but also you are being compensated for the work you do as a landlord. Moreover, because the house doesnt trade in a liquid market like REITs do, it is possible to actually get a good deal, as opposed to the fair deal you will get on a REIT. TLDR The ""passive income"" generated by REIT investment is more similar to generic equitybond investment than it is to an investment in a physical home that you rent out. If what you want is to make money without doing anything besides bear risk, you should invest in a fully diversified portfolio of financial assets equity and bonds being the primary constituents but REITs potentially being a part as well.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are REIT worth it and is it a good option to generate passive income for a while?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Should I reallocate my portfolio now or let it balance out over time?,"I would not sell unless the stock is starting to fall in price. If you are a long term investor you can review the weekly chart on a weekly basis to determine if the stock is still uptrending. Regarding HD below is a weekly chart for the last 4 years Basically if the price is making Higher Highs HH and Higher Lows HL it is uptrending. If it starts to make Lower Lows LL followed by Lower Highs LH then the uptrend is over and the stock could be entering a downtrend. With HD, the price has been uptrending but seems to now be hitting some headwinds. It has been making some HHs followed by some HLs throughout the last 2 years. It did make a LL in late August 2015 but then recovered nicely to make a new HH, so the uptrend was not broken. In early November 2016 it made another LL but this time it seems to be followed by a LH in midDecember 2016. This could be clear evidence that the uptrend may be ending. The final confirmation would be if the price drops below the early November low of 119.20 the orange line. If price drops below this price it would be confirmation that the uptrend is over and this should be the point at which you should sell your HD shares. You could place an automatic stop loss order just below 119.20 so that you dont even need to monitor the stock frequently. Another indication that the uptrend may be in trouble is the divergence between the HHs of the price and the peaks of a momentum indicator in this case the MACD. The two sloping red lines show that the price made HHs in April and August 2016 whilst the momentum indicator made LHs at these peaks in the price. As the lines are sloping in different directions it is demonstrating negative divergence, which means that the momentum of the uptrend is slowing down and can act as an early warning system to be more cautious in the near future. So the question you could be asking is when is a good time to sell out of HD or at least some of your HD to rebalance? Why sell something that is still increasing in price? Only sell if you can determine that the price will not be increasing anymore in the near to medium term.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Should I reallocate my portfolio now or let it balance out over time?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How much time should be spent on Penny Stocks Trading a day?,"1 Dont trade individual stocks. You expose yourself to unnecessary risk. 2 Pick a fund with low expenses that pays a dividend. Reinvest the dividend back into the fund. To quote Einstein The greatest power on earth is compound interest. Something is wrong with the software of the site.

The price is only relevant in comparison to the dividend. It is the dividend that is important, not the price. The price is irrelevant if you never sell. Dividend paying securities are what you buy and hold. Then you reinvest the dividend and buy more of the security. As I am buying the security with the dividend I am actually pleasantly surprised when the price goes down. When the price goes down, but the dividend remains the same, I am able to buy more shares of the security withwith that dividend.

Fractional Reserve Banking and Insolvency,"You bet if it was so simple. This is when financial acumen comes into its true form. The bank would never ever want to go insolvent. What it does is, take insurance against the borrower defaulting. Remember the financial crisis of 2008 which was the outcome of borrowers defaulting. The banks had created derivatives based on the loans distributed. CDO, CDS are some of the simple derivatives banks sell to cover their backs in case of defaults. There are derivatives using these derivatives as underlyings which they then sold it across to other buyers including other banks. Google for Fabrice Tourre and you would realise how much deep the banks go to save themselves from defaulters. If everything fails then go to the government for help.

How does Vanguard determine the optimal asset allocation for their Target Retirement Funds?,"Googling vanguard target asset allocation led me to this page on the Bogleheads wiki which has detailed breakdowns of the Target Retirement funds that page in turn has a link to this Vanguard PDF which goes into a good level of detail on the construction of these funds portfolios. I excerpt To the question of why so much weight in equities In our view, two important considerations justify an expectation of an equity risk premium. The first is the historical record In the past, and in many countries, stock market investors have been rewarded with such a premium. ... Historically, bond returns have lagged equity returns by about 56 percentage points, annualizedamounting to an enormous return differential in most circumstances over longer time periods. Consequently, retirement savers investing only in safe assets must dramatically increase their savings rates to compensate for the lower expected returns those investments offer. ... The second strategic principle underlying our glidepath constructionthat younger investors are better able to withstand riskrecognizes that an individuals total net worth consists of both their current financial holdings and their future work earnings. For younger individuals, the majority of their ultimate retirement wealth is in the form of what they will earn in the future, or their human capital. Therefore, a large commitment to stocks in a younger persons portfolio may be appropriate to balance and diversify risk exposure to workrelated earnings To the question of how the exact allocations were decided As part of the process of evaluating and identifying an appropriate glide path given this theoretical framework, we ran various financial simulations using the Vanguard Capital Markets Model. We examined different riskreward scenarios and the potential implications of different glide paths and TDF approaches.

Why would this FHA refinance cause my mortgage insurance payment to increase so much?,"If youre refinancing a conforming Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage, dont go with an FHA. Try a HARP refinance, which wont increase your mortgage insurance even if your home has lost value.

I have savings and excess income. Is it time for me to find a financial advisor?,"Whether your financial status is considered ""OK"" depends on your aspirations. You arent spending more than you earn and have no debt. That puts you in the category of OK in my book, but the information in your post indicates that you would benefit from some financial advice100 grand sounds like a lot of money to have in a bank unless you are on the verge of spending it. Financial advisors come in various shapes and sizes. Many will charge you a lot for what turns out to be helpful advice in the first meeting, but very little valueadded thereafter. Some dont have the best incentives they may be incentivized to encourage you to put your money into certain funds, for example. There are many financial advisors of sorts that you have access to that wont cost you anything. For example, if you have a 401k at work, I bet there is a representative from the plan administrator that will meet with you for free. If you open a brokerage account or IRA at any place Fidelity, Vanguard, etc. you can easily talk with one of their reps and get all sorts of advice. My personal take is to meet with anyone who will meet with me for free, but not to pay anyone for this service. Its too easy to get good advice and paying for it doesnt guarantee that you get better advice. Your financial situation will depend primarily on a few things you have not mentioned here. For example, How much are you setting aside for retirement and what are your retirement goals? This is something lots of people can give you advice on, but we dont know what market returns will be going forward so we dont really know. One bit of advice that may benefit you is how to set aside money for retirement in the most tax advantaged way. How much do you feel that you need saved up for large expenses? Thinking of starting a family? How many months worth of income are you comfortable having set aside? What is your tolerance of risk? If you put your money in risky assets, you may make more, but you may also actually lose money. Those are the questions a financial advisor will ask about. Once you have hisher adviceand preferrably after talking to a few advisorsyou can make your own decision. Basically, your options are Rules of thumb Save only what makes sense to save in banks given your expected needs for cash. Put a lot in tax advantaged accounts dont give Uncle Sam any gifts. Then look at financial and real investments. There are a number of free resources on the internet. For example FutureAdvisor. Or you can hit up the forums at BogleHeads. Those guys give and receive financial advice as a hobby. They arent professionals, but you can get a lot of varying ideas and make up your own mind, which to me is better than just asking a professional. BTW, regarding the ESPP these plans often give you a discount on stock and can therefore be a good idea. Just be sure you dont hold the stock longer than you need to. Its generally a bad idea to concentrate your wealth in any single investment, especially one highly correlated with your background risk i.e., if the company does poorly you will already be worse off because you may lose your job or see fewer advancement opportunities. No need to add losses in your savings to that. 1 Please note I am neither advocating nor discouraging buying guns, gold, or other controversial real assets.

Can written options be exercised against you prior to expiry when they become inthemoney?,"Yes, if its an American style option. American style options may be exercised at any time prior to expiration even if theyre not inthemoney. Generally, you are required to deliver or accept delivery of the underlying by the beginning of the next trading day. If you are short, you may be chosen by the clearinghouse to fulfill the exercise a process called ""assignment"". Because the clearinghouse is the counterparty to every options trade, you can be assigned even if the specific person who purchased the option you wrote didnt exercise, but someone else who holds a long position did. Similarly, you might not be assigned if that person did exercise. The clearinghouse randomly chooses a brokerage to fulfill an assignment, and the brokerage will randomly choose an individual account. If youre going to be writing options, especially using spreads, you need to have a plan ahead of time on what to do if one of your legs gets assigned. This is more likely to happen just before a dividend payment, if the payment is more than the remaining time value.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can written options be exercised against you prior to expiry when they become inthemoney?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does giving to charity work?,"The intention of making the charitable contributions tax deductible is to provide an economic incentive to contribute to organizations which tend to improve the general welfare of the community.

Unless you own a home and have a mortgage you may not have enough deductions to get any financial benefit from charitable contributions.

Selling equities for realestate down payment,"My suggestion would be to do the math. That is the best advice you can get when considering any investment. There are other factors you havent considered, too... like the fact that interest rates are at extremely low levels right now, so borrowing money is relatively cheap. If youre outside the US though, that may be less of a consideration as the mortgage lending institutions in Europe only tend to give 5year locks on loan rates without requiring a premium. You may be somewhere else in the world. You will probably struggle to do the actual math about the probability of the market going down or up, but what you can do is this Figure out what it would cost you to cash out the investments. You say your balance is 53,000 in various items. Congrats! Thats a nice chunk of money. But with commissions and taxes and etc., it may reduce the value of your investments by 10  25 when you try to cash out those investments. Paying 3,000 to get that money out of the investments is one thing... but if youre sending 10,000 to the tax man when you sell this all off, that changes the economics of your investments a LOT. In that case you might be better off seeing what happens if the markets correct by 10... youd still have more than if you sold out and paid major taxes. Once you know your down payment, calculate the amount of property you could afford. You know your down payment could be somewhere around 50,000 after taxes and other items... At an 8020 loantovalue ratio thats about 250,000 of a property that you can qualify for, assuming you could obtain the loan for 200,000. What could you buy for that? Do some shopping and figure out what your options are... Once you have two or three potential properties, figure out the answer to ""What would the property give you?"" Is it going to be rented out? Are you going to live there? Both? If youre living in it, then you come out ahead if the costs for the mortgage debt and the ongoing maintenance and repairs are less than what you currently pay in rent. Figure out what you pay right now to put a roof over your head. Will the place you could buy need repairs? Will you pay more on a mortgage for 200,000 USD in your local currency than what you currently do for housing? Dont even factor in the possible appreciation of a house you inhabit when youre making this kind of investment decision... it could just as easily burn down as go up in value. If you would rent it, what kind of rental would that be? Longterm rental? Expect to pay for other people to break your stuff. Shortterm rental? You can collect more money per tenant per day, but youll end up with higher vacancy rates. And people still break your stuff. But do the math and see if you could collect enough in rent from a tenant person or business or whatever the properties are you could buy to cover the amount you are paying in debt, plus what you would pay in taxes rent is income, plus what you would need for maintenance, plus insurance. IF the numbers make sense, then real estate can be a phenomenally lucrative investment. I own some investment properties myself. It is a great hedge against inflation you can raise rents when contracts lapse... usually and it is an excellent way to own a tangible item.

If you had X in cash, would you buy your companys stock as an investment? If so, then option 2 is best, because you can get X in stock for a lower cost. Option 3 might be better if the gain on the stock will be taxed higher, but theyre pretty much equivalent if theres no chance that the stock will drop below Y If not, then option 4 is best since you will likely get more than XY from selling the options that by exercising them and selling the stock since options have time value.

Why do some people say a house not an investment?,"Your house is not an asset, it is a liability. Assets feed you. Liabilites eat you.

If you add up all the income your primary residence generates and subtract all the expenses it incurs, you will see why investment gurus claim this. Perform the same calculations for a rental property and youre more likely to find it has a positive cash flow. If it has a negative cash flow, its not an asset either its a liability. A rental property with a negative cash flow is still an investment, but cash flow gurus will tell you its a bad investment. While it is possible that your house may increase in value and you may be able to sell it for more than you paid, will you be able to sell it for more than all of the expenses incurred while living there? If so, you have an asset. Some people will purchase a home in need of repair, live in it and upgrade it, sell it for profit exceeding all expenses, and repeat.

What are some good software packages for Technical Analysis? ,"About 10 years ago, I used to use MetaStock Trader which was a very sound tool, with a large number of indicators, but it has been a number of years since I have used it, so my comments on it will be out of date.

There are quicker levels of data access, which might suit you, but I cant comment on these. It is webbased which is key for me. The data quality is very good and the number of inbuilt indicators is excellent. You can build search routines on the basis of specific indicators which is very effective. Im looking at VectorVest, as a replacement for or in addition to Incredible Charts, as it has very powerful backtesting routines and the ability to run test portfolios with specific buysell criteria that can simulate and backtest a number of trading scenarios at the same time.

How to pick a state to form an LLC in?,"There are very few circumstances where forming an out of state entity is beneficial, but a website is within these circumstances in certain instances. Businesses with no physical operations do not need to care what jurisdiction they are registered in your home state, a better united state or nonunited state. The ""limited liability"" does its job. If you are storing inventory or purchasing offices to compliment your online business, you need to register in the state those are located in. An online business is an example of a business with no physical presence. All states want you to register your LLC in the state that you live in, but this is where you need to read that states laws. What are the consequences of not registering? There might be none, there might be many. In New York, for example, there are no consequences for not registering and registering in new york  especially the city  is likely the most expensive in the USA. If your LLC needs to represent itself in court, New York provides retroactive foreign registrations and business licenses. So basically, despite saying that you need to pay over 1000 to form your LLC ""or else"", the reality is that you get the local limited liability protection in courts whenever you actually need it. Check your local state laws, but more times than not it is analogous to asking a barber if you need a haircut, the representative is always going to say ""yes, you do"" while the law, and associated case law, reveals that you dont. The federal government doesnt care what state your form an LLC or partnership in. Banks dont care what state you form an LLC or partnership in. The United States post office doesnt care. Making an app? The Apple iTunes store doesnt care. So that covers all the applicable authorities you need to consider. Now just go with the cheapest. In the US alone there are 50 states and several territories, all with their own fee structures, so you just have to do your research. Despite conflicting with another answer, Wyoming is still relevant, because it is cheap and has a mature system and laws around business entity formation. httpwww.incorp.com has agents in every state, but there are registered agents everywhere, you can even call the Secretary of State in each state for a list of registered agents. Get an employer ID number yourself after the business entity is formed, it takes less than 5 minutes. All of this is also contingent on how your LLC or partnership distributes funds. If your LLC is not acting like a pass through entity to you and your partner,but instead holding its own profits like a corporation, then again none of this matters. You need to form it within the state you live and do foreign registrations in states where it has any physical presence, as it has becomes its own tax person in those states.

Personal Loan How to define loan purpose,"Does that justify the purpose? That is for individual Banks to decide.

You are looking at funding your eduction via loan and you are earning enough for living and paying of the loan. I noticed that a lot of lenders do not lend to applicants whose purpose is to finance the tuition for postsecondary education This could be because the lenders have seen larger percentage defaults when people opt for such loans.

Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?,"Youre asking if lottery ticket can ever produce a positive expected value EV. The short answer is, ""no"". Theres an interesting article that goes into the details and is heavy on the math and graphs. The key point Even if you think you have a positive expected value due to the size of the jackpot being larger than the number of possible numbers, as more tickets are purchased and the jackpot grows larger the odds of someone else picking the winner goes up and your EV goes down. The article concludes [It] ... paints a grim picture for anyone still holding out hope that a lottery ticket can ever be an economically rational investment. As the jackpot grows in value, the number of people who try to win it grows superlinearly. This human behavior has a mathematical consequence even though the jackpot itself can theoretically grow without bound, there is a point at which the consequent ticketbuying grows to such a fever pitch that the expected value of the jackpot actually starts going down again.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How can I stop a merchant from charging a credit card processing fee?,"You have no recourse on the spot to do anything to the vendor other than pay the fee, pay cash, or walk away. If youre on a mission with longerterm horizon than immediate satisfaction, your options will vary by state. If youre in a state where the fees are legal and the owner is potentially violating an agreement with the card company, you can report the vendor to the card company. They may or may not really care. If youre in a state where the fee is actually illegal, youd need to see what options you have with the local authorities. You should keep in mind that if the vendor is violating an agreement thats between the vendor and the card company only, you have absolutely no rights to enforce that agreement. You only have legal rights if youre a party to the agreement in question or if the law gives you some special rights specific to given circumstances. The lawyers call this having ""standing.""

Car dealers offering lower prices when financing a used car,"With new cars its usually the other way around finance at a low APR or get cash back when you buy it outright. With used cars you usually dont know how much they have invested in the car, so its more difficult to know how low theyre willing to go. Regardless, I do think its odd that they would knock 2K off the price if you finance with them, but not if you pay cash. The only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2K in interest over the life of the loan, but they have no way of guaranteeing you wont refi. Therefore, I suspect they are bluffing and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check or put the cash on the table for 2K less. However, if they wont budge and will only knock off 2K if you finance, you could finance and pay it off in full a week later.

How credible is Stansberrys video End of America?,"If we postulate that there is at least some element of truth to the phrase A leopard does not change his spots and then consider this tidbit He conveniently forgets to mention his 1.5 million dollar fraud fine from the SEC over investment advice he sold through a news letter. The SEC claimed and the judge agreed that the report was replete with lies. I think that gives you just about all you might need to know regarding the man behind the video, and the nature of its content. Oh, and its purpose? To SELL YOU the same said newsletter. I guess its natural for Stansberry to feel as he does. After all if the US gov had just busted me for conning and lying to folks, and fined ME 1.5Mill, Id be having some pretty intense lurid fantasies about it going down in flames, and trying to hide any money I had left offshore also. A huge amount of his argument hinges on the US no longer being the worlds reserve currency. Firstly, while Ill admit Im none too happy with the way the national debt has been managed for oh, around 30 years how, which includes I will note going from a pretty much balanced budget, to around an 80 increase in the debt from 2001 through 2008, when times were good and there was little need to spend money we didnt have, when compared to a lot of other countries, we still dont look that bad. You have to ask yourself this first, if not the US, then WHO? are the governments of the world going to trust China? could the Yen handle the load? Is the Euro any better off especially considering problems in Greece, Ireland, etc. Do countries like Switzerland have enough liquidity and available ways to invest there? In order for the US to STOP being the worlds reserve currency, you must have something to replace it with, and really, can we realistically think of one countrycurrency with the capability to become a new world reserve currency??? Secondly, even then should such a shift actually happen, it doesnt mean people will ALL just magically stop buying US debt. Yes the demand would go down, but it would not go to zero. There are after all a worldfull of other countries whos money is right now NOT the world reserve currency, and yet they are able to sell bonds and people and even other countries invest there. China for example does not invest exclusively in the US, so yeah we might have to start paying more interest to get people to buy US debt, but its not like the demand will go away.

Tax me more Can I pay extra to the government so I dont have to deal with all this paperwork? ,"Perhaps the real question you are asking is ""How can the tax code be fixed to make it simple for everyone including me, and what would it take to effect those changes""? There are really two causes for the complexity of the tax code. Many of those who enter Government hold a desire for power, and Government uses the tax code as one lever of power to distribute largess to their supporters, and to nudge everyone to behaviors which they favor. The current system enables incumbents to spend taxpayer money to reward those they favor, and thus they accumulate power and security. Those who enter Government also love to spend money especially other peoples money, and their rapacious behavior recognizes no boundaries. They will spend money without control until the taxpayers yank them to a brutal stop. They enact complex rules which are used to ease the tax burden for some, which buys their support with taxpayer money, and they spend money to benefit those which they favor. The system of lobbyists and contributors exists to entice Government to treat them and the causes they support favorably. This system enables incumbents to spend taxed money to reward those they favor, and to tax those they disfavor. Thus their greed is satisfied, and their power is increased. The freedom you seek is not available, although you can minimize the effort required for compliance. You can take the standard deduction, and use nothing but the W2 provided by your employer, and unless you are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax, you will find that the tax software will do most of the work for you. Do you want to approach the Nirvana of minimal effort to appease your tax collectors? Avoid starting your own business, charitable donations, investment income, 1099 income, and you will need minimal paperwork. Avoid earning enough to risk the AMT Alternative Minimum Tax. Refuse to take the mortgage interest deduction, tax credits for electric vehicles, tax credits for highefficiency appliances and air conditioners, tax credits for residential solar panel installations. Do not own investments which pay interest, or own stocks where you need to track the ""basis"" purchase price of the stocks, nor buy and then sell valuable items that might gain value where you would need to track the purchase price, the ""basis"". Avoid owning and leasing a rental home for income, deducting businesses expenses and mileage for business purposes, contributions to a retirement plan outside an employer plan  all complicate your tax filing. The solution you truly desire is either a ""Flat Tax"" or the ""Fair Tax"". These solutions would effect either a single tax rate with no deductions or adjustments to income, yeah right, or a national retail sales tax, which would tax the money spent in the economy regardless of the source of the money legal, gifts, crime and there would be no need to report income, or classify it. The largest objection to either is that the tax code might become less ""progressive"" increasing tax rate with increasing income.

Should I find a regular job or continue doing what am doing? ,"This might sound harsh, but the first thing I would suggest is to stop making excuses. I wasnt able to continue due to pressure from college and family The college I went to was horrible. Employers can very easily hire foreign workforce for very cheap for example as a citizen if I work 10 an hour, they can get someone from outside to work for 5 per hour Theres no guarantee that the project will succeed. I cannot really work and at the same time develop software on my free time. Despite my failures in the past, I was not the main person thats responsible for those failures. Even if all of this is true, its not helping you move forward and it seems to be getting in the way of creating a good action plan and motivating yourself to succeed. If you believe based on past experiences that you are doomed to fail, then you are indeed doomed to fail. You need to take a step back and reevaluate your current circumstances and what you can do to reach your goals. You have a couple of things working in your favor here. Its great that you are debt free. That already puts you ahead of a lot of your peers. You have the option of living with your parents. Presumably for no rent, or at least much lower rent than you would have to pay if you move out. This is worth literally thousands of  for every year you stay. Now, onto your questions 1 Should I quit regular programming for a normal job because I never monetized programming so I can move out of my parents home? Are you being paid for this ""regular programming""? If so, are you being paid more than minimum wage? If not, its perfectly acceptable to consider alternative ways to spend your time and generate income. However, this doesnt have to be at the expense of living with your parents. Have you thought about getting a new or second job while still living with them? If you absolutely must move out of your parents home, consider renting a room in a house with other people to keep the rent costs to a minimum. That way, even if your main job is low paying, you should be able to put aside some money each month for future endeavors. 2 Should I monetize programming and gamble with the future? What does this mean? Are you thinking youll write a mobile app and sell thousands of copies for 99 each? That would indeed be a big gamble, but maybe thats not what you meant, so youll need to clarify. 3 Would it be wise to essentially quit programming for the sake of a minimum wage job? Im not sure how this is different from question 1. So Ill reiterate what I said there  moving out is going to be expensive. You can still do it, but youre asking on a Personal Finance site where the focus is usually how to minimize living costs and maximize income. Without knowing more about where you live employment opportunities, cost of living the default recommendation is usually to save money by staying in your parents house. TLDR Dont focus on anyone else. They are not preventing you from getting the job you want. Look at your own skills and qualifications not just programming, consider all of your abilities. What are you good at? Who might need those skills? What is the cost of reaching those people commute time, moving nearer? What is the reward?

Applying for and receiving business credit,"Im afraid the great myth of limited liability companies is that all such vehicles have instant access to credit. Limited liability on a company with few physical assets to underwrite the loan, or with insufficient revenue, will usually mean that the owners or others will be asked to stand surety on any credit. However, there is a particular form of ""credit"" available to businesses on terms with their clients. It is called factoring. Factoring is a financial transaction whereby a business sells its accounts receivable i.e., invoices to a third party called a factor at a discount in exchange for immediate money with which to finance continued business. Factoring differs from a bank loan in three main ways. First, the emphasis is on the value of the receivables essentially a financial asset, not the firms credit worthiness. Secondly, factoring is not a loan  it is the purchase of a financial asset the receivable. Finally, a bank loan involves two parties whereas factoring involves three. Recognise that this can be quite expensive. Most banks catering to small businesses will offer some form of factoring service, or will know of services that offer it. It isnt that different from cheque encashment services payday services where you offer a discount on future income for money now. An alternative is simply to ask his clients if theyll pay him faster if he offers a discount since either of interest payments or factoring would reduce profitability anyway.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Applying for and receiving business credit?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why would my job recruiter want me to form an LLC?,"There are a few sites out there that can give you some reasoning behind the request. LegalZoom, for instance. To quote the LZ doc in case the link dies Employee vs. Independent Contractor If a worker is an employee, the employer is responsible for paying Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicare, and possibly other costs like workers compensation insurance for the employee at the end of the tax year, the employer is responsible for compiling all necessary payroll reports, including W2 forms. If a worker is an independent contractor, the employer is not responsible for any of the above taxes or payments, and the only added paperwork is the issuing of a 1099 to the independent contractor at the end of the tax year, if he or she has made more than 600 with the employer. As Kent suggested, you should speak with an attorney really you need one if setting up an LLC. There are a lot of companies out there these days that try to classify people as contractors rather than fulltime employees as it gets them out of paying benefits and dealing with taxes. This is being heavily cracked down on, and several ""contractor"" employees are winning lawsuits to get fulltime status. If you are truly acting as a contractor, then setting up an LLC can help with a few items such as taxes and protection on certain business aspects see comments below regarding this. Its easy and relatively cheap cost me about 250 with extra legal advice tacked on.

I dont have to make a payment until October. I currently owe 3,000 and I could pay it all off. Should I do that or leave that money in my savings account that earns 2 interest? The question seems to seek a general rule of thumb for how to behave with smaller debts. And a general rule of thumb could be taken from one of two principles which seem to be religious camps. The ""free money"" camp believes that you can invest even small amounts of money riskfree and receive high returns, tax free, for zero effort. The ""reduce debt"" camp believes that you should pay off debts so that you have the freedom to live your life unfettered. Which religion do you prefer? I tend to prefer paying off debts. The ""free money"" tent wants you to pay the car off over the next 6 months, earning interest. Suppose you can earn 2 interest .0212 per month, paying 500 per month for 6 months. So you earn interest on 3000 the first month, 2500, the second month, 2000 the third month, So, are you feeling rich, earning 13.13? How much time did you spending making the 5 additional payments?

Tax consequences when foreign currency changes in value,"If you buy foreign currency as an investment, then the gains are ordinary income. The gains are realized when you close the position, and whether you buy something else go back to the original form of investment is of no consequence. In case 1 you have 125 income. In case 2 you have 125 income. In case 3 you have 166 loss. You report all these items on your Schedule D. Make sure to calculate the tax correctly, since the tax is not capital gains tax but rather ordinary income at marginal rates.

Exposure to Irish Housing Market,"There contracts called an FX Forwards where you can get a feel for what the market thinks an exchange rate will be in the future. Now exchange rates are notoriously uncertain, but it is worth noting that at current prices market believes your Krona will be worth only 0.0003 Euro less three years from now than it is worth now. So, if you are considering taking money out of your investments and converting it to Euro and missing out on three years of dividends and hopefully capital gains its certainly possible this may work out for you but this is unlikely. If you are at all uncertain that you will actually move this is an even worse idea as paying to convert money twice would be an additional expense on top of the missed returns. There are FX financial products futures and forwards where you can get exposure to FX without having to put the full amount down. This could help hedge your house value but this can be extremely expensive over time for individual investors and would almost certainly not work in your favor.

Does investing more money into stocks increase chances of profit?,"I think you are mixing up the likelihood of making a profit with the amount of profit. The likelyhood of profit will be the same, because if you buy 100 worth of shares and the price moves up you will make a profit. If you instead bought 1000 worth of the same shares at the same price and the price moved up you would once again make a profit. In fact if you dont include commissions and other fees, and you buy and sell at the same prices, you percentage profit would be the same. For example, if you bought at 10 and sold at 12, you percentage gain of 20 would be the same no matter how many shares you bought not including commissions. So if you bought 100 worth your gain would have been 20 or 20 and if you bought 1000 worth your gain would have been 20 or 200. However, if you include commissions, say 10 in and 10 out, your net profit on 100 would have been 0 0 and your net profit on 1000 would have been 180 18.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Does investing more money into stocks increase chances of profit?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

15 year mortgage vs 30 year paid off in 15,"Why would anyone ever get a 15 year instead of just paying off a 30 year in 15 years? Because the rate is not the same.

For your situation paying cash, want to keep the car longterm but also save money I recommend seriously considering a slightly used vehicle, maybe 2 or 3 years old, or a ""certified preowned vehicle"". Reasons Much less expensive than a brand new car because the first two years have the biggest depreciation hit. Cars come with a 4year warranty, so a 3 year old car will still be in warranty. Yes, a certified preowned car will have a bit of a premium compared to a privateparty used car, but the peace of mind of knowing its in good shape is worth the extra cost considering you want to keep it long term.

Why is a stock that pays a dividend preferrable to one that doesnt?,"Check out the questions about why stock prices are what they are. In a nutshell, a stocks value is based on the future prospects of the company. Generally speaking, if a growth company is paying a dividend, that payment is going to negatively affect the growth of the business. The smart move is to reinvest that capital and make more money. As a shareholder, you are compensated by a rising stock price. When a stock isnt growing quickly, a dividend is a better way for a stockholder to realize value. If a gas and electric company makes a billion dollars, investing that money back into the company is not going to yield a large return. And since those types of companies dont really grow too much, the stocks typically trade in a range and dont see the type of appreciation that a growth stock will. So it makes sense to pay out the dividend to the shareholders.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is a stock that pays a dividend preferrable to one that doesnt?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Value of a collateralized asset,"Youre not missing any concepts! It sounds like you are contributing a piece of collateral to the business, and you want to know a fair way to value how much this contribution of collateral is worth.

So for example suppose that the business could get a loan at 17 without the collateral maybe just on a credit card but with the duplex as collateral it is able to get the loan at 10.5. In principle, the value of this collateral is 17  10.5 or 6.5, because it has allowed the business to pay 6.5 less interest on its loan.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Value of a collateralized asset?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"What type of investments should be in a TFSA, given its taxfree growth and withdrawal benefits?","I think ""optimal"" is a term that needs to be better qualified  whats optimal investment for one person is not necessary optimal for another, as it depends on the investors time horizon, risk tolerance, and investment knowledge. I would personally put fixincome or products that generates incomes that CRA considers as ""interest"" products in the TFSA so the gains arent taxed at all. I would consider putting preferred shares in this account as well, since dividend incomes are taxed higher than capital gain and preferred shares dont usually change in price unless the companys ability to pay the dividends are indoubt. I dont want to put common equities in TFSA as that would take away your ability to leverage past losses to reduce future capital gains. If you are using TFSA as a way to accelerate saving for a nearterm purchase, then you definitely want to employ fixincome products as the underlying saving vehicle, since market volatility would be your enemy unless you are feeling very lucky. If you are using TFSA as a way to supplement your registered retirement saving account, then you can treat it the same way you would invest in your RRSP.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What type of investments should be in a TFSA, given its taxfree growth and withdrawal benefits?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does startup equity end up paying off?,"I agree with all the people cautioning against working for free, but Ill also have a go at answering the question When do I see money related to that 5? Is it only when they get bought, or is there some sort of quarterly payout of profits? Its up to the shareholders of the company whether and when it pays dividends. A new startup will typically have a small number of people, perhaps 13, who between them control any shareholder vote the founders and an investor. If theyre offering you 5, chances are theyve made sure your vote will not matter, but some companies an equity partnership springs to mind might be structured such that control is genuinely distributed. You would want to check what the particular situation is in this company. Assuming the foundersmain investors have control, those people or that person will decide whether to pay dividends, so you can ask them their plans to realise money from the company. It is very rare for startups to pay any dividends. This is firstly because theyre rarely profitable, but even when they are profitable the whole point of a startup is to grow, so there are plenty of things to spend cash on other than payouts to shareholders. Paying anything out to shareholders is the opposite of receiving investment. So unless youre in the very unusual position of a startup that will quickly make so much money that it doesnt need investment, and is planning to pay out to shareholders rather than spend on growth, then no, it will not pay out. One way for a shareholder to exit is to be bought out by other shareholders. For example if they want to get rid of you then they might make you an offer for your 5. This can be any amount they think youll take, given the situation at the time. If you dont take it, there may be things they can do in future to reduce its value to you see below. If you do take it then your 5 would pay you once, when you leave. If the company succeeds, commonly it will be wholly or partly sold either privately or by IPO. At this point, if its wholly sold then the soontobeexshareholders at the time will receive the proceeds of the sale. If its partly sold then as with an investment round its up for negotiation what happens. For example I believe the cash from an IPO of X of the company could be taken into the company, leaving the shareholders with no immediate direct payout but 100X of shares in their names that theyre moreorless free to sell, or retain and receive future dividends. Alternatively, if the company settles down as a small private business thats no longer in startup mode, it might start paying out without a sale. If the company fails, as most startups do, it will never pay anything. Its very important to remember that its the shareholders at the time who receive money in proportion to their holding or as defined by the company articles, if there are different classes of share. Just because you have 5 now doesnt mean youll have 5 by that time, because any new investment into the company in the mean time will ""dilute"" your shareholding. It works like this Note that Ive assumed for simplicity that the new investment comes in at equal value to the old investment. This isnt necessarily the case, it can be more or less according to the terms of the new investment voted for by the shareholders, so the first line really is ""nominal value"", not necessarily the actual cash the founders put in. Therefore, you should not think of your 5 as 5 of what you imagine a company like yours might eventually exit for. At best, think of it as 5 of what a company like yours might exit for, if it receives no further investment whatsoever. Ah, but wont the founders also have their holdings diluted and lose control of the company, so they wouldnt do that? Well, not necessarily. Look carefully at whether youre being offered the same class of shares as the founders. If not consider whether they can dilute your shares without diluting their own. Look also at whether a new investor could use the founders executive positions to give them new equity in the same way they gave you old equity, without giving you any new equity. Look at whether the founders will themselves participate in future investment rounds using sacks of cash that they own from other ventures, when you cant afford to keep up. Look at whether new investors will receive a priority class of share thats guaranteed at exit to pay out a certain multiple of the money invested before the older, inferior classes of shares receive anything VCs like to do this, at least in the UK. Look at any other tricks they can legally pull even if the founders arent inclined to be tricky, they may eventually be forced to consider pulling them by a future new investor. And when I say ""look"", I mean get your lawyer to look. If your shareholding survives until exit, then it will pay out at exit. But repeated dilutions and investors with priority classes of shares could mean that your holding doesnt survive to exit even if the company does. Your 5 could turn into a nominal holding that hasnt really ""survived"", that entitles you to 0.5 of any sale value over 100 million. Then if the company sells for 50 million you get 0, while other investors are getting a good return. All of this is why you should not work for equity unless you can afford to work for free. And even then you need to lawyer up, now and during any future investment, so your lawyer can explain to you what your investment actually is, which almost certainly is different from what it looks like at a casual uninformed glance.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does startup equity end up paying off?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Can a wealthy investor invest in or make a deal with a company before it goes public  IPO?,"IPO is ""Initial Public Offering"". Just so you know. The valuations are done based on the company business model, intellectual property, products, market shares, revenues and profits, assets, and future projections. You know, the usual stuff. Yes, it is. And very frequently done. In fact, I cant think of any company that is now publicly traded, that didnt start this way.

What is the difference between ""normal"" investor and ""angel""? What do you refer to as ""angel""? How is it abnormal to you?

You may have heard of the term ""angels"" with regards to hightech start up companies. These are private investors not funds that invest their own money in start ups at very early stages. Theyre called ""angels"" because they invest at stages at which it is very hard for entrepreneurs to raise money theres no product, no real business, usually it is a stage of just an idea or a patent with maybe initial prototype and some preliminary business analysis. These people gamble, in a sense, and each investment is very small relatively to their wealth  tens of thousands of dollars, sometimes a hundred or two thousands, and they make a lot of these. Some may fail and they lose the money, but those that succeed  bring very high returns. Imagine investing 10K for 5 stake at Google 15 years ago.

Higher returns from international markets?,"Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile  higher risk trades off against higher return potential, always.

SP is consistently beating inflation?,"TLDR Because stocks represent added value from corporate profits, and not the price the goods themselves are sold at.

If Apple has historically performed well, and analysts expect it to continue to perform, then investors will pay more for a stock that they feel will continue pay good dividends in the future. Compound this with the fact that there is usually limited a supply of stock for a particular company unless they issue more stock. If we go back to Apple as an example, they can raise their price they charge on an iPhone from 400 to 450 over the course of say a couple years. Some of this may be due to higher wage costs, but efficiencies in the marketplace actually tend to drive down costs to produce goods, so they will probably actually turn a higher profit by raising their price, even if they have to pay higher wages or possibly even if they dont raise their price!. This, in economics, is termed value added. Finally, Hart is absolutely correct in his comment about the stocks in the SP 500 not being static.

Are banks really making less profit when interest rates are low? ,"Banks make less profit when ""long"" rates are low compared to ""short"" rates. Banks lend for long term purposes like five year business loans or 30 year mortgages. They get their funds from mostly ""short term"" deposits, which can be emptied in days. Banks make money on the difference between 5 and 30 year rates, and short term rates. It is the difference, and not the absolute level of rates, that determines their profitability. A bank that pays 1 on CDs, and lends at 3 will make money. During the 1970s, short rates kept rising,and banks were stuck with 30 year loans at 7 from the early part of the decade, when short rates rose to double digits around 1980, and they lost money.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are banks really making less profit when interest rates are low?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Less than a year at my first job out of college, what do I save for first?","I wish I was in your shoes with the knowledge I have in my head. financial goal setting is a great plan at your age. In my humble opinion you dont want to save for anything... you want to invest as much as you can, create a corporation and have the corporation invest as much as possible. When there is enough monthly cash flow coming from your investments... have the corporation buy you a house, a car, take out an insurance policy on you as key employee... etc. As for the 11,000 laying around in cash as an emergency fund, no way! With returns as high as 13 per month invested properly keep it invested. Getting to your emergency cash reserve you have in a trading account is only a couple key strokes away. As for the 401k... If it is not making at least 25 yearly for the last 10 years excluding your Contributions do it yourself in a self directed IRA. Oh... I forgot to mention When your corporation buys your stuff... if set up correctly you can take them as a loss in the corporate ledger and you know any loss from one entity can offset profits from another, thus reducing any taxes you may have.

What is the best way to help my dad consolidate his credit card debt at a lower rate?,"I agree with you that you need to consolidate this debt using a loan. It may be hard to find a bank or credit organization that will give you an unsecured personal loan for that much money. I know of one, called Lending Club Disclaimer  Im an investor on this platform. Not trying to advertise, its just the only place I know of off the top of my head that facilitates loans like this, but instead of a bank financing the loan, the loan is split up accross hundreds of investors who each contribute a small amount such as 25. They have rates anywhere between 530, based on your credit profiles, and I believe they have some loan amounts that go up to the area that youre discussing. Regarding buying the house  The best thing you can do when trying to buy a house is to save up a 20 downpayment, if at all possible. Below this amount, you may be asked to pay for PMI  Private Mortgage Insurance. This is a charge that doesnt go away for quite a while until youve paid them 20 of the appraised value of the home, where you pay a premium because you didnt have the 20 downpayment for the house. I would suggest you try to eliminate your credit card debt as soon as possible, and would recommend the same for your father. Getting your utilization down and reconsolidating the large debts with a loan will help to reduce interest charges and get you a reasonable, fixed payment. Whether you decide to pay off your own balances using your savings account is up to you if it were me, personally, Id do so immediately rather than trying to pay it off over time. But if you lose money to taxes by withdrawing the money from your tax free savings account, it may not be a beneficial situation. Treat debt, especially credit card debt, like an emergency at all times, and youll find yourself in a better place as a result. Credit card debt and balances are and should be temporary, and their rates and fees are structured that way. If, for any reason, you expect that a credit cards balance will remain for an extended period of time, you may want to consider whether it would be advantageous for you to consolidate the debt into a loan, instead.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."
Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?,"While tax deferral is a nice feature, the 401k is not the Holy Grail.

As long as the investment options in your 401k are good, then I would stick with it.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Is the YaleSwenson Asset Allocation Too Conservative for a 20 Something?,"I dont think the advice to take lots more risk when young makes so much sense. The additional returns from loading up on stocks are overblown and the rocky road from owning 75100 stocks will almost certainly mess you up and make you lose money. Everyone thinks theyre different, but none of us are. One big advantage of stocks over bonds is tax efficiency only if you buy index funds and dont ever sell them. But this does not matter in a retirement account, and outside a retirement account you can use taxexempt bonds. Stocks have higher returns in theory but to have a reasonable guarantee of higher returns from them, you need around a 30year horizon. That is a long, long time. Psychologically, a 6040 stocksbonds portfolio, or something with similar risk mixing in a few more alternative assets like Swensons, is SO MUCH better. With 100 stocks you can spend 10 or 15 years saving money and your investment returns may get you nowhere. Think what that does to your motivation to save. And how much you save is way more important than what you invest in. The same doesnt happen with a balanced portfolio. With a balanced portfolio you get reasonably steady progress. You can still have a down year, but youre a lot less likely to have a down decade or even a down few years. You save steadily and your balance goes up fairly steadily. The way humans really work, this is so important. For the same kind of reason, I think its great to buy one fund that has both stocks and bonds in there. This forces you to view the thing as a whole instead of wrongly looking at the individual asset class ""buckets."" And it also means rebalancing will happen automatically, without having to remember to do it, which you wont. Or if you remember you wont do it when you should, because stocks are doing so well, or some other rationalization. Speaking of rebalancing, thats where a lot of the steady, predictable returns come from if you have a nice balanced portfolio. You can make money over time even if both asset classes end up going nowhere, as long as they bounce around somewhat independently, so youll buy low and sell high when you rebalance. To me the ideal is an allinone fund that aims for about 6040 stocksbonds level of risk, somewhat more diversified than stocksbonds is great international stock, commodities, high yield, REIT, etc.. You can just buy that at age 20 and keep it until you retire. In beautiful idealworld economic theory, buy 90 stocks when young. Real world with human brain involved I love balanced funds. The steady gains are such a mental win. The ""target retirement"" funds are not a bad option, but if you buy the matching year for your age, I personally wish they had less in stocks.

Can landlordproperty change unit after approval and payment of fees?,"Without the specifics of the contract, as well as the specifics of the countrystatecity youre moving to, its hard to say whats legal. But this also isnt law.se, so Ill answer this from the point of view of personal finance, and what you canshould do as next steps. Whenever paying an application fee or a deposit, you need to ensure that you have in writing exactly what youre applying for or putting a deposit in for. Whether this is an apartment, a car, or a loan, before any money changes hands, you need to get in writing exactly what youre putting that money to. So for a car, youd want to have the complete specifications  make, model, year, color, extra packages, and any relevant loan information if applicable. You wouldnt just hand a dealer 2000 for ""a Toyota Camry"", youd make sure it was specified which one, in writing, as well as the total youre expecting to pay. Same for an apartment you should have, in writing email is fine the specific unit you are putting a deposit for, and the specific rate youll be paying, and the length of time the lease is for. This is to avoid a common tactic bait and switch, which is what it looks like youve run into. A company puts forth a ""nice"" model, everything looks good, you get far enough in that it seems like youre locked in  and then it turns out youre really getting a less nice model thats not as ideal as whatever you signed up for. Now if you want to get what you originally signed up for you need to pay extra  presumably ""something was wrong in the original ad"", or something like that. And all you can hear in the background is Darth Vader... ""I am altering the deal. Pray I dont alter it any further."" So what do you do when youve been baitandswitched? The best thing to do is typically to walk away. Try to get your application fee back you may or may not be able to, but its worth a shot, and even if you cannot, walk away anyway. Someone who is going to baitandswitch on you is probably not going to be a good landlord my guess is that rent is going to keep going up beyond the level of the market, and you probably can kiss your security deposit goodbye. Second, if walking away isnt practical for whatever reason, you can find out what the local laws are. Some locations though very few, sadly require advertised prices to be accurate particularly the fact that they readvertised the unit again for the same rate suggests they are falling afoul of that. You can ask around, search the internet, or best yet talk to a lawyer who specializes in this sort of thing some of them will be willing to at least answer a few questions for free hoping to score your business for an easy, profitable lawsuit. Be aware that its not exactly a good situation to be in, to be suing your landlord second only to suing your employer, in my opinion, in terms of bad things to do while hoping to continue the relationship. Find an alternative as soon as you can if you go this route. In the future, pay a lot of attention to detail when making application fees. Often the application fee is needed before you get into too much detail  but pick a location that has reasonable application fees, and no extras. For example, in my area, its typical to pay a 25 application fee, nonrefundable, to do the credit check and background check, and a refundable 100200 deposit to hold the unit while doing that a place that asks for a nonrefundable deposit is somewhere Id simply not apply at all.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can landlordproperty change unit after approval and payment of fees?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"If I have some old gold jewellery, is it worth it to sell it for its melt value?","I have a buddy that used to run one of those companies that buys gold like the ones you see on TV. Heres the deal... 1 If the jewelry isnt total junk, get it appraised. Making raw materials into jewelry obviously increases the value since you cant buy jewelry for the price of raw gold. In many cases it will be worth more as jewelry, but not always. Depends on the piece. 2 Those companies generally rely on the fact that people selling jewelry to a gold dealer are in a hurry to get cash and are very negotiable on what they will take for it. Depending on how predatory they are, you will probably get between 50 and 75 of the market rate. They make a living on the spread and peoples need for quick cash. They usually resell it immediately to a 3rd party that actually melts it down and resells it. So the short answer to your question is no, you wont get close to market value with these companies. You would do better if you didnt have to go through the middle man, but then those final buyers arent generally the ones who have set up shop to deal with the general public.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If I have some old gold jewellery, is it worth it to sell it for its melt value?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is investing in housing considered an adequate hedge against inflation?,"No, there is no linkage to the value of real estate and inflation.

How can I improve my credit score if I am not paying bills or rent?,"When you say ""promptly paying off the outstanding balance"", do you mean you pay it off literally as soon as you have incurred the debt? It is important to actually let the debt post on a statement before you pay it off. If you pay it off before the statement posts then this wont help your credit at all. Once the statement posts you can pay the entire balance off before the due date and you will still pay no interest. Assuming you are allowing the balance to actually post on your statements, you can simply continue to do this and your credit score will improve over time as your accounts get older and you show that you are reliable. The only other way to improve your credit score is to open more accounts. In the short term this will actually hurt your score, as it will decrease your average age of account and add an inquiry. However in the midlong term, this will improve your score as having more accounts of a variety of types is better for your score. Having an installment loan such as an auto loan or home loan is good for your score as it is different from a credit card  however you should definitely not engage in one of these unless it makes financial sense for other reasons. Dont add debt just to build your credit score. You could just open more credit cards. Like I said it will hurt your score in the short term but improve it in the midlong term.

So now the owners share in the company is around 91. However if they can get a price of only Rs 200 per share, they need to create 50 more shares. So now the total shares is 150 [100 older plus 50].

"When applying for a mortgage, can it also cover outstanding debts?","That really depends on the lender, and in the current climate this is extremely unlikely. In the past it was possible to get a loan which is higher than the value of the house deposit considered, usually on the basis that the buyer is going to improve the property extend, renovate, etc. and this increase the value of the property. Responsible lenders required some evidence of the plans to do this, but less responsible ones simply seem to have given the money. Here in the UK this was often based on the assumption that property value tends to rise relatively quickly anyway so a seeminglyreasonable addition to the loan on top of the current value of the property will quickly be covered. That meant that indeed some people have been able to get a loan which is higher than the cost of the purchase, even without concrete plans to actively increase the value of the property. Today the situation is quite different, lenders are a lot more careful and I cant see this happening. All that aside  had it been possible, is it a good idea? I find it difficult to come up with a blanket rule, it really depends on many factors  On the one hand mortgage interest rates tend to be significantly lower than shorter term interest rates and from that point of view, it makes sense, right?! However  they are usually very long term, often with limited ability to overpay, which means the interest will be paid over a longer period of time.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."
Whats the difference between a high yield dividend stock vs a growth stock?,"If you are looking to reinvest it in the same company, there is really no difference. Please be aware that when a company announces dividend, you are not the only person receiving the dividend. The millions of share holders receive the same amount that you did as dividend, and of course, that money is not falling from the sky. The company pays it from their profits. So the day a dividend is announced, it is adjusted in the price of the share. The only reason why you look for dividend in a company is when you need liquidity. If a company does not pay you dividend, it means that they are usually using the profits to reinvest it in the business which you are anyway going to do with the dividend that you receive. Unless its some shady company which is only established on paper. Then they might use it to feed their dogp. To make it simpler lets assume you have Rs.500 and you want to start a company which requires Rs 1000 in capital   1. You issue 5 shares worth Rs 100 each to the public and take Rs 100 for each share. Now you have Rs 1000 to start your company. 2. You make a profit of Rs 200. 3. Since you own majority of the shares you get to make the call whether to pay Rs.200 in dividend, or reinvest it in the business. Case 1 You had issued 10 shares and your profit is Rs 200. You pay Rs. 20 each to every share holder. Since you owned 5 shares, you get 520 that is Rs.100 and you distribute the remaining to your 5 shareholders and expect to make the same or higher profit next year. Your share price remains at Rs.100 and you have your profits in cash. Case 2 You think that this business is awesome and you should put more money into it to make more. You decide not to pay any dividend and invest the entire profit into the business. That way your shareholders do not receive anything from you but they get to share profit in the amazing business that you are doing. In this case your share price is Rs. 120 100020010 and all your profits are reinvested in the business. Now put yourself in the shareholders shoes and see which case suits you more.

Tips for insurance coverage for onemanteams,"While the OP disses the health insurance coverage offered through his wifes employer as a complete ripoff, one advantage of such coverage is that, if set up right by the employer, the premiums can be paid for through pretax dollars instead of posttax dollars. On the other hand, Health insurance premiums cannot be deducted on Schedule C by selfemployed persons. So the selfemployed person has to pay both the employers share as well as the employees share of Social Security and Medicare taxes on that money. Health insurance premiums can be deducted on Line 29 of Form 1040 but only for those months during which the Schedule C filer is neither covered nor eligible to be covered by a subsidized health insurance plan maintained by an employer of the selfemployed person whose selfemployment might be a sideline or the selfemployed persons spouse. In other words, just having the plan coverage available through the wifes employment, even though one disdains taking it, is sufficient to make a Line 29 deduction impermissible. So, AGI is increased. Health insurance premiums can be deducted on Schedule A but only to the extent that they together with other medical costs exceed 10 of AGI. For many people in good health, this means no deduction there either. Thus, when comparing the premiums of health insurance policies, one should pay some attention to the tax issues too.

He was able to get his first credit card through the same credit union without falling work the bureaucratic BS that comes with dealing with a large bank.

He has also been able to get a student loan without needing a cosigner so he can attend college. The idea that one needs to have a credit score established before being an adult is a fallacy. Like my son, I started my credit on my own and have never needed a cosigner whether it was my first credit card at 17 the credit union probably shouldnt have done that since i wasnt old enough to be legally bound, my first car at 18 or my first home at 22. For both my son and I, knowing how to use credit responsibly was far more valuable than having a credit score early. Before your children are 18 opening credit accounts with them as the primary account holder can be problematic because they arent old enough to be legally liable for the debt. Using them as a cosigner is even more problematic for the same reason. Each financial institution will have their own rules and I certainly dont know them all. For what you are proposing I would suggest a small line of credit with a credit union.

How can banks afford to offer credit card rewards?,"Michael Pryors answer is accurate to the actual question asked. The current accepted answer from Dheer is not entirely true but roughly provides an overview of the different entities involved in a typical transaction, with some wrong terminologies, corrected and improved below. The issuing bank, the one that issues the credit card to the customer. When it comes to the service fee split, the issuer bank takes on the majority of the cut in the service fee paid by the merchant to the different entities. For example, on a 2.5 overall fee paid by merchant, roughly 1.5 goes to the issuer, 0.3 goes to the card network visa, master card, etc and the remaining 0.7 goes to the acquiring bank. Reward programs have a partnership with participating merchants, where merchants are charged a higher service fee, for the likelihood of driving a higher volume of transactions to the merchant. A portion of the rewards also comes from the issuer, who shares a percentage of their fee back to the customer, in exchange for the same likelihood of making more profit through increased volume in total transactions. For example, a reward program may charge merchants 4.5 fee, with 3.5 of it going to the issuer. Upto 3 of this can be given back to the customer for their loyalty in using the card service. The banks can afford to take as little as 0.5 instead of their regular 1.5 due to the increased volume of transactions and the fixed fee they collect as membership fee. Note that costco has a similar business plan, but they make money entirely of membership fee. So with enough clients, banks can theoretically afford to run their program entirely on membership fees, costing no additional service fee to merchants. The service fee depicted above is arbitrary, and it can be lowered if the merchant is also a client of the issuing bank, that is, both the issuing bank and acquiring bank are the same. So it is kind of a winwinwin situation. And as usual, the banks can afford to make a larger income, if the customer ends up paying interest for their credit  although the rewards program is not designed accounting on this.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can banks afford to offer credit card rewards?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

If you are lucky youll make a profit if and when you sell it, but dont count on that. It does store value, but except for taking loans against that its had to access that value. And lower loan rates than youd otherwise pay are not a huge value when youd save more if you dont borrow at all.

If you are seriously considering the investment, try to calculate adjusted funds from operations AFFO, which deducts the likely expenditures necessary to maintain the real estate portfolio.

If they owe money on it, how are they making their payments? If they close the business, do they have enough income to make the payments still? Before they find another job, even if its just a parttime job? As to paying off their debts or at least helping with paying them off, Id only do that if I was in a financial position to gift them the money anything else is going to wreak havoc with the family dynamics including cosigning debt for them and everybody will wish they didnt go there.

Formula that predicts whether one is better off investing or paying down debt,"The formula you are looking for is pretty complicated. Its given here httpitl.nist.govdiv898handbookedasection3eda3661.htm You might prefer to let somebody else do the grunt work for you. This page will calculate the probability for you httpstattrek.comonlinecalculatornormal.aspx. In your case, youd enter mean.114, standard deviation.132, and ""standard score"" ... oh, you didnt say what youre paying on your debt. Lets say its 6, i.e. .06. Note that this page will give you the probability that the actual number will be less than or equal to the ""standard score"". Enter all that and click the magic button and the probability that the investment will produce less than 6 is ... .34124, or 34. The handy rule of thumb is that the probability is about 68 that the actual number will be within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95 that it will be within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7 that it will be within 3. Which isnt exactly what you want because you dont want ""within"" but ""less than"". But you could get that by just adding half the difference from 100 for each of the above, i.e. instead of 689599.7 it would be 849899.9. Oh, I missed that in a followup comment you say you are paying 4 on a mortgage which you are adjusting to 3 because of tax implications. Probability based on mean and SD you gave of getting less than 3 is 26. I didnt read the article you cite. I assume the standard deviation given is for the rate of return for one year. If you stretch that over many years, the SD goes down, as many factors tend to even out. So while the probability that money in a given, say, mutual fund will grow by less than 3 in one year is fairly high  the 25  35 were talking here sounds plausible to me  the probability that it will grow by an average of less than 3 over a period of 10 or 15 or 20 years is much less. Further Thought There is, of course, no provablytrue formula for what makes a reasonable risk. Suppose I offered you an investment that had a 99 chance of showing a 5,000 profit and a 1 chance of a 495,000 loss. Would you take it? I wouldnt. Even though the chance of a loss is small, if it happened, Id lose everything I have. Is it worth that risk for the modest potential profit? Id say no. Of course to someone who has a billion dollars, this might be a very reasonable risk.

"Need exit strategy for aging mother who owns aging rental properties, please","I debated whether to put this in an answer or a comment, because Im not sure that this can be answered usefully without a lot more information, which actually would then probably make it a candidate for closing as ""too localized"". At the very least we would need to know where which jurisdiction she is located in. So, speaking in a generic way, the options available as I see them are Contact the mortgage companies and explain she cant continue to make payments. They will likely foreclose on the properties and if she still ends up owing money after that if you are in the US this also depends on whether you are in a ""nonrecourse"" state then she could be declared bankrupt. This is rather the ""nuclear option"" and definitely not something to be undertaken lightly, but would at least wipe the slate clean and give her some degree of certainty about her situation. Look very carefully at the portfolio of properties and get some proper valuations done on them depending on where she is located this may be free. Also do a careful analysis of the property sales and rental markets, to see whether property prices  rental rates are going up or down. Then decide on an individual basis whether each property is better kept or sold. You may be able to get discounts on fees if you sell multiple properties in one transaction. This option would require some cold hard analysis and decision making without letting yourselves get emotionally invested in the situation difficult, I know. Depending on how long she has had the properties for and how she came to own them, it MIGHT be an option to pursue action against whoever advised her to acquire them. Clearly a large portfolio of decaying rental properties is not a suitable investment for a relatively elderly lady and if she only came by them relatively recently, on advice from an investment consultant or similar, you might have some redress there. Another option could she live in one of the properties herself to reduce costs? If she owns her own home as well then she could sell that, live in the one of the rentals and use the money saved to finance the sale of the other rentals. Aside from these thoughts, one final piece of advice dont get your own finances tangled up in hers so dont take out a mortgage against your own property, for example. Obviously if you have the leeway to help her out of your budget then that is great, but I would restrict that to doing things like paying for grocery shopping or whatever.

Eg.. buying a handmade shoes vs corporation made shoes? choose handmade one because it fits above two. buying a corporate one would be more polluting and less rewarding because you just gave your money to someone who already has lots and cares least about you. in what way are you saying mortgage is good? I see that as a waste. you can pay back your mortgage only when someone takes even bigger mortgage check with some maths before refuting... in other words you have taken part in ponzi scheme.! I would suggest making a house vs buying one is better spending. finally spending is a best saving.. dont forget that you are getting money only because someone is spending wisely. stop feeding your money to corporates and interests and everyone will have plenty to spend.,"What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How to spend more?

What does this diagram from Robert Kiyosaki about corporations mean?,"These types of diagrams appear all throughout Kiyosakis Rich Dad, Poor Dad book. The arrows in the diagrams represent cash flow. For example, the first two diagrams of this type in the book are The idea being presented here is that an asset generates income, and a liability generates expenses. According to the book, rich people spend their money buying assets, while middle class people buy liabilities. The diagram you posted above does not appear in the edition of the book I have Warner Books Edition, printed in 2000. However, the following similar diagram appears in the chapter titled ""The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations"" The idea behind this diagram is to demonstrate what the author considers the tax advantages of a personal corporation using a corporation to pay for certain expenses with pretax dollars. Here is a quote from this chapter Employees earn and get taxed and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. Its one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. Theyre easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cash flow. For example by owning your own corporation  vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on  but do it legally with pretax dollars. This piece of advice, like so much of the book, may contain a small amount of truth, but is oversimplified and potentially dangerous if taken a face value. There are many examples, as JoeTaxpayer mentioned, of people who tried to deduct too many expenses and failed to make a business case for them that would satisfy the IRS.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What does this diagram from Robert Kiyosaki about corporations mean?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Are my parents ripping me off with this deal that doesnt allow me to build my equity in my home?,"Are you in the United States? Is there some sort of written agreement that the money your parents paid into the house is a loan that will be paid back? I assume the deed to the home is in your name, and your parents do not have a lien on the property in any way? In the United States provided there is no lien and your parents are not also on the mortgage, that home is 100 yours. Now I would argue you still owe your parents money, but absent some sort of contract it sounds like an interest free loan that youll pay back at a rate of 500month. Your parents could attempt to sue you and if this happens I recommend you find a real estate attorney. Its unlikely that they would win the case since theres no paperwork and even if there was it is unlikely to hold up since it so strongly favors them  your parents .

Unusual real estate market with seemingly huge rental returns,"The way to resolve your dilemma is to consult the pricetorent ratio of the property. According to smartasset.com The pricetorent ratio is a measure of the relative affordability of renting and buying in a given housing market. It is calculated as the ratio of home prices to annual rental rates. So, for example, in a real estate market where, on average, a home worth 200,000 could rent for 1000 a month, the pricerent ratio is 16.67. Thats determined using the formula 200,000  12 x 1,000. Smartasset.com also goes on to give a table comparing different cities pricetorent ratio and then claim that the average pricetorent ratio is currently 19.21. If your pricetorent ratio is lower than 19.21, then, yes, your rents are more expensive than the average house. Smartasset.com claims that a high pricetorent ratio is an argument in favor of tenants ""renting"" properties while a low pricetorent ratio favors people ""buying"" either to live in the property or to just rent it out to other people. So lets apply the pricetorent ratio formula towards the properties you just quoted. Theres a specific house I could buy for 190 perhaps even less that rents for exactly 2000  month. 190K2000  12  7.92 Theres a house for sale asking 400 been on the market 2 yrs! could probably get for 350 which rents for 2800 month. 400K280012  11.90 350K280012  10.42 One can quite easily today buy a house for 180k270k that would rent out for 17002100  month. Lower Bound 180K170012  8.82 Upper Bound 270K210012  10.71 Even so, the rental returns here seem ""ridiculously high"" to me based on other markets Ive noticed. Considering how the average pricetorent ratio is 19.21, and your pricetorent ratio ranges from 7.92 to 11.90, you are indeed correct. They are indeed ""ridiculously high"". Qualification I was involved in real estate, and used the pricetorent ratio to determine how long it would take to ""recover"" a persons investment in the property. Keep in mind that its not the only thing I care about, and obviously the pricetorent ratio tends to downplay expenses involved in actually owning properties and trying to deal with periods of vacancy. Theres also the problem of taking into account demand as well. According to smartasset.com, Detroit, MI has the lowest pricetorent ratio with 6.27, which should suggest that people should buy properties immediately in this city. But thats probably more of a sign of people not wanting to move to Detroit and bid up the prices of properties. EDIT I should also say that just because the properties are ""ridiculously expensive"" right now doesnt mean you should expect your rents to decrease. Rather, if rents keep staying at their current level, Id predict that the property values will slowly increase in the future, thereby raising the pricetorent ratio to nonridiculous mode.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Unusual real estate market with seemingly huge rental returns?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is Systematic about Systematic Investment Plan SIP and who invented it?,"Personally, I think you are approaching this from the wrong angle. Youre somewhat correct in assuming that what youre reading is usually some kind of marketing material. Systematic Investment Plan SIP is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world. Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the US. On average, verified by many studies, individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners. Say you decide to invest in a mutual fund, dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when you feel the market is low. As an example Ill compare investing 50 per week on Wednesdays, versus 1 share per week on Wednesdays, or the full 850 on the first Wednesday. Ill use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example VLCAX. I realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different, I just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle. By investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a lower average share price while the share price climbs. It also keeps your investment easy to budget. Vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds, rather than parsing out a lump sum in to smaller periodic investments, which is illustrated in the third column above and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing. Ultimately, all of these companies are vying to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique. If they all called dollar cost averaging, ""dollar cost averaging"" none of them would appear to be unique. So they devise neat acronyms but its all pretty much the same idea.

Does borrowing from my 401k make sense in my specific circumstance?,"Since most of the answers are flawed in their logic, I decided to respond here. 1 ""What if you lose your job, you cant pay back the loan"" The point of the question was to reduce the amount paid per month. So obviously it would be easier to pay off the 401k loan rather than the 3 separate loans that are in place now. Also its stated in the question that theres a mortgage, a child with medical costs, a car loan, student loans, other debt. On the list of priorities the 401k loan does not make the top 10 concerns if they lost their job. 2 ""Consider stopping the 401k contribution"" This is such a terrible idea. If you make the full contribution to the 401k and then just withdraw from the 401k rather than getting a loan you only pay a 10 penalty tax. You still get 90 of the company match. 3 ""You lose compound interest"" While currently the interest you get on a 401k depending on how that money is invested is higher than the interest you pay on your loans which means it would be advantageous to keep the loans and keep contributing to the 401k, its very unreliable and might even go down. I think you actually have a good case for getting a loan against the 401k if a You have your spending and budget under control b Your income is consistent c You are certain that the loan will be paid back. My suggestion would be to take a loan against the 401k, but keep the current spending on the loans consistent. If you dont need the extra 150 per month, you really should try to pay off the loans as fast as you can. If you do need the 150 extra, you are lowering the mental threshold for getting more loans in the future.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

How do I get into investing in stocks?,"Start by paying down any high interest debt you may have, like credit cards. Reason being that they ultimately eat into any positive returns you may have from investing. Another good reason is to build up some discipline. You will need discipline to be a successful investor.

I would also suggest getting into the habit of reading the Wall Street Journal or at the very least the business section of the New York Times.

Can paying down a mortgage be considered an investment?,"If your mortgage interest is taxdeductible, its generally a bad idea to pay down the principal on the mortgage because youd be losing the tax deduction.

Is it a good idea to rebalance without withdrawing money?,"Rebalancing has been studied empirically quite a bit, but not particularly carefully and actually turns out to be very hard to study well. The main problem is that you dont know until afterward if your target weights were optimal so a bad rebalancing program might give better performance if it strayed closer to optimal weights even if it didnt do an efficient job of keeping near the target weights. In your particular case either method might be preferred depending on a number of things You can see why there isnt a generally correct answer to your question and the results of empirical studies might very wildly depending on the mix of assets and risk tolerance. Still if your portfolio is not too complicated you can estimate the costs of the two methods without too much trouble and figure out if it is worthwhile to you. EDIT In Response to Comment Below Your example gets at what makes rebalancing so hard empirically but also generally pretty easy in practice. If you were to target 75 Equity 25 bonds? and look at returns only for 30 years the ""best"" rebalancing method would be to never rebalance and just let 75 equity go to near 100 as equity has better long term returns. This happens when you look only at returns as the final number and dont take into account the change in risk in your portfolio. In practice, most people that are still adding or subtracting in retirement to a retirement portfolio are adding removing a significant amount compared to the total amount in their portfolio. In the case you discribe, it is cheaper massively cheaper in the presence of load fees just to use new capital to trade toward your target, keeping your risk profile. New money should be large enough to keep you near enough your target. If you just estimate the trading costsfees in both cases I think youll see just how large the difference is between the two methods this will dwarf any small differences in return over the long run even if you cant trade back all the way to your target.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is it a good idea to rebalance without withdrawing money?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What else besides fees should I consider in rebalancing my fund portfolios asset allocation?,"Taxes Based on the numbers you quoted 360 it doesnt appear that you would have a taxable event if you sell all the shares in the account. If you only sell some of the shares, to fund the new account, you should specify which shares you want to sell. If you sell only the shares that you bought when share prices were high, then every share you sell could be considered a loss. This will increase your losses. These losses can be deducted from your taxes, though there are limits. Fees Make sure that you understand the fee structure. Some fund families look at the balance of all your accounts to determine your fee level, others treat each fund separately. Procedure If you were able to get the 10K into the new account in the next few months I would advise not selling the shares. Because it will be 6 to 18 months before you are able to contribute the new funds then rebalancing by selling shares makes more sense. It gets you to your goal quicker. All the funds you mentioned have low expense ratios, I wouldnt move funds just to chase a the lowest expense ratio. I would look at the steps necessary to get the mix you want in the next few weeks, and then what will be needed moving forward. If the 6040 or 4060 split makes you comfortable pick one of them.

"Gap in domestic Health Insurance coverage, expect higher premiums?","The insurance company is must assume you do have a preexisting condition you are unaware of. The reason for that is that Affordable Care Act precludes the Insurance company from denying coverage of them if you do. Insurance companies are businesses. They are in business to make moneyunless you have a nonprofit insurer. They can not do that if you can buy insurance only when you need for them to pay out. So even though you may not have a preexisting condition, they are precluded from requiring an examination that would detect the most expensive preexisting conditions hidden cancers, neurological, autoimmune disorders. So the companies must do what takes business sense and either deny you coverage or charge a rate that covers the risk they would be forced to take. In your question on travel there was a response that suggested you get international health insurance instead of travel health insurance that would be considered credible coverage. You are trying to save money which on a personal level is a good idea. However that is against the societal and business need that you maintain health coverage during your healthy times to cover the costs of those who need expensive treatment. So you will be monetarily penalized should you choose to reenter the society of insured people. Once you have paid the higher rate for up to 18 months you should be able to get a better policy for people who have had continuous coverage.

My boss wants to buy me a gift. How do I account for taxes for this?,"Gifts given and received between business partners or employersemployees are treated as income, if they are beyond minimal value. If your boss gives you a gift, she should include it as part of your taxable wages for payroll purposes  which means that some of your wages should be withheld to cover income, social security, and Medicare taxes on it. At the end of the year, the value of the gift should be included in Box 1 wages of your form W2. Assuming thats the case, you dont need to do anything special. A 1099MISC would not be appropriate because you are an employee of your boss  so the two of you need to address the full panoply of employment taxes, not just income tax, which would be the result if the payment were reported on 1099MISC. If the employer wants to cover the cost to you of the taxes on the gift, theyll need to ""gross up"" your pay to cover it. Lets say your employer gives you a gift worth 100, and youre in a 25 tax bracket. Your employer has to give you 125 so that you end up with a gain of 100. But the extra 25 is taxable, too, so your employer will need to add on an extra 6.25 to cover the 25 tax on the 25. But, wait, now weve gotta pay 25 tax on the 6.25, so they add an extra 1.56 to cover that tax. And now theyve gotta pay an extra .39 . . . The formula to calculate the grossup amount is where [TAX RATE] is the tax rate expressed as a percentage. So, to get the grossedup amount for a 100 gift in a 25 bracket, wed calculate 11.25, or 1.75, or 1.333, multiply that by the target gift amount of 100, and end up with 133.33. The equation is a little uglier if you have to pay state income taxes that are deductible on the federal return but its a similar principle. The entire 133.33 would then be reported as income, but the net effect on the employee is that theyre 100 richer after taxes. The ""grossup"" idea can be quite complicated if you dig into the details  there are some circumstances where an additional few dollars of income can have an unexpected impact on a tax return, in a fashion not obvious from looking at the tax table. If the employer doesnt include the gift in Box 1 on the W2 but you want to pay taxes on it anyway, include the amount in Line 7 on the 1040 as if it had been on a W2, and fill out form 8919 to calculate the FICA taxes that should have been withheld.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: My boss wants to buy me a gift.

How to learn about doing technical analysis? Any suggested programs or tools that teach it?,"A lot of investors prefer to start jumping into tools and figuring out from there, but Ive always said that you should learn the theory before you go around applying it, so you can understand its shortcomings. A great starting point is Investopedias Introduction to Technical Analysis. There you can read about the ""idea"" of technical analysis, how it compares to other strategies, what some of the big ideas are, and quite a bit about various chart patterns cup and handle, flags, pennants, triangles, head  shoulders, etc. Youll also cover ideas like moving averages and trendlines. After that, Charting and Technical Analysis by Fred McAllen should be your next stop. The material in the book overlaps with what youve read on Investopedia, but McAllens book is great for learning from examples and seeing the concepts applied in action.

Id like to quote a part of a review here to show my point What I like about Mr. Murphy is his way of showing and proving a point. Let me digress here to show you what I mean Say you had a daughter and wanted to show her how to figure out the area of an Isosceles triangle. Well, you could tell her to memorize that it is baseheight2. Or if you really wanted her to learn it thoroughly you can show her how to draw a parallel line to the height, then join the ends to make a nice rectangle. Then to compute the area of a rectangle just multiply the two sides, one being the height, the other being half the base. She will then ""derive"" this and ""understand"" how they got the formula. You see, then she can compute the area under a hexagon or a tetrahedron or any complex object. Well, Mr. Murphy will show us the same way and ""derive"" for us concepts such as how a resistance line later becomes a support line! The reson for this is so amusing that after one reads about it we just go ""wow..."""" Now I understand why this occurs"". Murphys book is not about strategy or which tools to use. He takes an objective approach to describing the basics about various tools and techniques, and leaves it up to the reader to decide which tools to apply and when. Thats why its 576 pages and a great reference whenever youre working. If you make it through and understand Murphy, then youll be golden. Again, understand the theory first, but make sure to see how its applied as well  otherwise youre just reading without any practical knowledge. To quote Richard Feynman It doesnt matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesnt matter how smart you are. If it doesnt agree with experiment, its wrong. Personally, I think technical analysis is all BS and a waste of time, and most of the top investors would agree, but at the end of the day, ignore everyone and stick to what works for you.

Sell your home and invest in growth stock mutual fund,"It wouldnt surprise me to see a countrys return to show Inflation  24, on average. The members of this board are from all over the world, but those in a low inflation country, as the US,Canada, and Australia are right now, would be used to a long term return of 810, with sub 2 inflation. In your case, the 20 return is looking backwards, hindsight, and not a guarantee. Your countrys 10 year bonds are just under 10. The difference between the 10 gov bond and the 20 market return reflects the difference between a guaranteed return vs a risky one. Stocks and homes have different return profiles over the decades. A home tends to cost what some hours pay per month can afford to finance. To explain  In the US, the median home cost will center around what the median earner can finance with about a weeks pay per month. This is my own observation, and it tends to be correct in the long term. When median homes are too high or low compared to this, they must tend back toward equilibrium. Your home will grow in value according to my thesis, but an investment home has both value that can rise or fall, as well as the monthly rent. This provides total return as a stock had growth and dividends.

Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?,"A terrific resource is this article. To summarize the points given PROS CONS There is no generic yes or no answer as to whether you ought to max out your 401ks. If you are a sophisticated investor, then saving the income for investing could be a better alternative. Long term capital gains are taxed at 15 in the US, so if you buy and hold on to good companies that reinvest their earnings, then the share price keeps going up and youll save a lot of money that would go in taxes. If youre not a very good investor, however, then 401ks make a lot of sense. If youre going to end up setting up some asset allocation and buying ETFs and rebalancing or having a manager rebalance for you every year or so, then you might as well take the 401k option and lower your taxable income. Point 1 is simply wrong, because companies that reinvest earnings and growing for a long time are essentially creating taxfree gains for you, which is even better than taxdeferred gains. Nonetheless, most people have neither the time nor the interest to research companies and for them, the 401k makes more sense.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

However, an ITIN will often not be necessary for W8BEN purposes if you have a tax number from your local jurisdiction. Check the Form W8BEN instructions for your specific situation, but some taxpayers will need neither a USissued ITIN nor a foreignissued TIN.

How to read a mutual fund spec sheet?,"The 0.14 is coming out of the assets of the fund itself. The expense ratio can be broken down so that on any given day, a portion of the funds assets are set aside to cover the administrative cost of running the fund. A funds total return already includes the expense ratio. This depends a lot on what kind of account in which you hold the fund. If you hold the fund in an IRA then you wouldnt have taxes from the fund itself as the account is sheltered. There may be notes in the prospectus and latest annual and semiannual report of what past distributions have been as remember the fund isnt paying taxes but rather passing that along in the form of distributions to shareholders. Also, there is something to be said for what kinds of investments the fund holds as if the fund is to hold smallcap stocks then it may have to sell the stock if it gets too big and thus would pass on the capital gains to shareholders. Other funds may not have this issue as they invest in largecap stocks that dont have this problem. Some funds may invest in municipal bonds which would have taxexempt interest that may be another strategy for lowering taxes in bond funds. Depending on the fund quite a broad range actually. In the case of the Fidelity fund you link, it is a ""Fund of funds"" and thus has a 0 expense ratio as Fidelity has underlying funds that that fund holds. What level of active management are you expecting, what economies of scale does the fund have to bring down the expense ratio and what expense ratio is typical for that category of fund would come to mind as a few things to consider. That Fidelity link is incorrect as both Morningstar and Fidelitys site list an expense ratio for the fund of funds at .79. Id expect an institutional US largecap index fund to have the lowest expense ratio outside of the fund of fund situation while if I were to pick an actively managed fund that requires a lot of research then the expense ratio may well be much higher though this is where you have to consider what strategy do you want the fund to be employing and how much of a cost are you prepared to accept for that?

What are the options for a 19yearold college student who only has about 1000?,"At that sum, it essentially doesnt matter what you do, unless you just want to outright gamble the money. Lets look at some options ""High"" interest guaranteed savings. A five year CD returns a sad 2 right now. That means if you invest all 1,000 into a CD, by 2016 you will have earned 105.08 in interest. Think about that About a hundred bucks over the next five years. Of course, with 3 inflation, that 105.08 will be worth about 90.57. In fact, the total amount will be worth 953.25. Your ""doing something with your money"" did nothing. Stocks can return significantly more interest, but there is no guarantee. Even if you made 20 year on year, you would only make maybe 1,500 in returns or so in the next 5 years, and 20 every year is like Warren Buffet territorytotally unrealistic. Thats also not taking into account inflation. And neither of these is taking into account taxes! However, if you go to a casino and gamble the 1,000, it is possible you could turn it into significantly more. Its very much unlikely, and I do not advise it at all, but its possible. The point is, you need money to make money, and, in some sense, 1,000 is not money at all. I recommend you work on your skills, knowledge, and preparation for making money in the future, and by 25 or so you can really be cooking with gas.

Any advantage to exercising ISOs in company that is not yet public?,"Exercising an option early if you cant sell the underlying stock being purchased is generally not advisable. Youre basically locking in the worst price you can possibly pay, plus youre losing the time value on your money which is, admittedly fairly low right now, but still. Lets say you have a strike price of 50. I get that you believe the stock to be worth more than 50. Lets assume that thats probably, but not certainly right. Whether its worth 51, 151, or 5,100 when your options are going to expire, you still get the profit of 1, 101, or 5,050 if you wait until expiration and exercise then. By exercising now, youre giving up two things The interest on the money you pay to exercise from now until expiration. The guarantee that you cant lose anything. If you buy it now, you get all the upside above your strike, but have all the downside below it. If you buy it later at expiration, you still have all the upside above your strike, but no downside  in the assumed to be unlikely event that its worth less than the strike you can simply do nothing, instead of having something you bought at the strike thats worth less now and taking that loss. By exercising early, you take on that loss risk, and give up the interest or ""carry"" on the money you spend to exercise for no additional updside. Its possible that there are tax benefits, as other posters mention, but the odds that ""starting the clock"" for LTCG is worth as much as the ""optionality"", or loss protection, plus the ""carry"", or interest that youre giving up is fairly unlikely.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Any advantage to exercising ISOs in company that is not yet public?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

More concretely Stock closes at 10share on July 1, and 11share on December 31. The plan buys for you at 9.50share. If you sell immediately, you clear 1.50share in profit, or a nearly 16 pretax gain. If the price declines instead of increases, though, you still see that 5 guaranteed profit. Combine that with the fact that youre contributing every paycheck, not all at once at the start, and your implied annual rate of return starts to look pretty good.

What are the alternatives to compound interest for a Muslim?,"I cannot tell you what is or is not allowed under Islamic law. What I can tell you is that when most investors talk about the ""power of compound interest,"" they are not actually necessarily talking about interest! The idea of the magic of compound interest is that when you receive an interest payment on your investment, you now have a larger investment, earning more interest. Your investment grows exponentially. This doesnt just apply to interest payments, however, but can apply to any type of investment where the profits of the investment cause the investment to get larger. For example, if you invest in a companys stock, and the value of the stock goes up 10 in a year, after that year your investment is worth more than it was at the beginning. If it goes up another 10 the following year, you have gained more money in the second year than you did in the first. Your gains are compounding, even though interest payments are not involved at all. The same is true if you reinvest dividends or if you use business profit to expand your business, for example. The term ""power of compound interest"" is so named for historical reasons, but really applies to any type of investment where the investment itself is growing.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are the alternatives to compound interest for a Muslim?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Can I prove having savings without giving out the account number?,"Giving out your bank account number is not generally a security problem. The first time you write your landlord a security deposit or rent check, hell have your account number. Its printed on the check.

"If I were to get into a life situation where I would not be able to make regular payments, do lenders typically provide options other than default?","Some lenders will work with you if you contact them early and openly discuss your situation. They are not required to do so. The larger and more corporate the lender, the less likely youll find one that will work with you. My experience is that your success in working out repayment plan for missed payments depends on the duration of your reduced income. If this is a period of unemployment and you will be able to pay again in a number of months, you may be able to work out a plan on some debts. If youre permanently unable to pay in full, or the duration is too long, you may have to file bankruptcy to save your domicile and transportation. The ethics of this go beyond this forum, as do the specifics of when it is advisable to file bankruptcy. Research your area, find debt counselling. They can really help with specifics. Speak with your lenders, they may be able to refer you to local nonprofit services. Be sure that you find one of those, not one of the predatory lenders posing as credit counselling services. Theres even some that take the money you can afford to pay, divide it up over your creditors, allowing you to keep accruing latepartial payment fees, and charge you a fee on top of it. To me this is fraudulent and should be cause for criminal charges. The key is open communication with your lenders with disclosure to the level that they need to know. If youre disabled, long term, they need to know that. They do not need to know the specific symptoms or causes or discomforts. They need to know whether the Social Security Administration has declared you disabled and are paying you a disability check. If this is the case, you probably have a case worker who can find you resources to help negotiate with your creditors.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If I were to get into a life situation where I would not be able to make regular payments, do lenders typically provide options other than default?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

If you are not paying interest on the medical bills and are just being allowed to spread out the payments, you are already golden and should just put up with the ups and downs. If you have any equity in a home, take out a home equity loan or line of credit, pay off your medical bills. Rates are still great right now.

What is the difference between shares and ETF?,"A mutual fund has several classes of shares that are charged different fees. Some shares are sold through brokers and carry a sales charge called load that compensates the broker in lieu of a fee that the broker would charge the client for the service. Vanguard does not have sales charge on its funds and you dont need to go through a broker to buy its shares you can buy directly from them. Admiral shares of Vanguard funds are charged lower annual expenses than regular shares yes, all mutual funds charge expenses for fund adninistration that reduce the return that you get, and Vanguard has some of the lowest expense ratios but Admiral shares are available only for large investments, typically 50K or so. If you have invested in a Vanguard mutual fund, your shares can be set to automatically convert to Admiral shares when the investment reaches the right level. A mutual fund manager can buy and sell stocks to achieve the objectives of the fund, so what stockes you are invested in as a share holder in a mutual fund will typically be unknown to you on a daytoday basis. On the other hand, Exchangetraded funds ETFs are fixed baskets of stocks, and you can buy shares in the ETF. These shares are bought and sold through a broker so you pay a transaction fee each time but expenses are lower since there is no manager to buy and sell stocks the basket is fixed. Many ETFs follow specific market indexes e.g. SP 500. Another difference between ETFs and mutual funds is that you can buy and sell ETFs at any time of the day just as if you could if you held stocks. With mutual funds, any buy and sell requests made during the day are processed at the end of the day and the value of the shares that you buy or sell is determined by the closing price of the stocks held by the mutual fund.

However, if you take the time to explain the situation to the business, and show them proof that you sent the payments I would guess they would probably be willing to work with you on removing any late fees you have been assessed or possibly setting up a payment plan. Also, if you have been charged any overdraft or minimum balance fees by your bank while they held your money for the payments that was eventually credited back to your account, you might be able to get them to refund those if you explain what has happened.

How do multicurrency bank accounts work? What is the advantage?,"Today typically a Business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency. Banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account. It is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency. So One can have an account number say 123456 and have it in say AUD and USD. So the balance will always show as X AUD and Y USD. If you deposit funds [electronic, check or cash] in USD your USD balance goes up. Likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing. Interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies. So in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts, with the advantage of remembering only one account number. Designate a particular currency as default currency. So if you dont quote a currency along with the account number, it would be treated as default currency. Otherwise you always quote the account number and currency. Ofcourse bundled with other services like free Fx Advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive. Edit If you have AUD 100 and USD 100, if you try and withdraw USD 110, it will not be allowed Unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion.

"What is beta for an investment or a portfolio, and how do I use it?","I dont think either of these answers are accurate. A beta of 0 means that your stockportfolio does not change accordingly or with the market, rather it acts independent. A beta above 0 means the stock follows what the market does. Which means if the market goes up the stock goes up, if the market goes down, the stock goes down. If the stocks beta is more than 1 the stock will go up more if the market goes up, or go down more if the market goes down. Inversely if the stock is less than 0 the stock will follow the market inversely. So if the market goes up, the stock goes down. If the market goes down, the stock goes up.

"Choosing the right NAPFA advisor, and whether fees are fair, etc.?","Some sample prices for straightforward payforhoursordeliverables planners I think Ive seen some similar rates elsewhere, too. Id feel like you might get something perfunctory and boilerplate for too much less than 1000  how could the person afford to spend much time?  and Id feel like lots more than 1000 for just a standard straightforward plan might be a ripoff. Basically youre paying 1000 for a day or two of work, you dont want just a couple hours of work, but you dont need a week of work either. Anyway, extracting the general guideline since prices may vary regionally or over time, you could figure it takes a day or two to do a decent job on a basic complete financial plan without a lot of complexities in it. From there you can decide whats fair, adding or subtracting time if you need less than a complete plan or have complex issues. This is assuming youre paying for time and deliverables, which is not a given. The biggest factor in how much you pay is probably how they charge a couple of the most common models, There are other models but these are the ones Ive seen most. The difference between these two models is a lot of money over time. Hourly is going to be much cheaper, because its a onetime cost instead of ongoing, and unrelated to what you have in assets. However, you wont get investment management, which can be valuable if you arent the kind to stick to an investment plan or you want someone else to completely take care of it for you. The investmentmanagement planners have the potential to make a lot more money and are more likely to be in it for the money. Hourly planners dont really have as good a business from a business owners perspective, but they are cheaper from a customer perspective, as long as youre happy to DIY a bit. One thing I like about hourly planners is that I dont really feel investments are the main place planners can add value, so it makes me nervous to have the compensation based on that. Insurance, estate planning, taxes, etc. are where its harder for a layperson to know all the ins and outs and DIY. From what Ive seen, the cheapest planners are the ones that you can get free or discounted from companies like USAA or Vanguard if you have an account with them. However, they will only recommend products from the company in question, so thats a downside, and you probably wont get to meet them in person.

A little advice pleasecar loan related,"Lets assess the situation first, then look at an option This leaves you with about 1,017mo in cash flow, provided you spend money on nothing else entertainment, oil changes, general merchandise, gifts, etc. So Id say take 200mo off that as ""backup"" money. Now were at 817mo. Question What have you been doing with this extra 800mo? If you put 600mo of that extra towards the 10 loan, it would be paid off in 12 months and you would only pay 508 in interest. If you have been saving it like all the wisest people say you should, then you should have plenty enough to either pay for a new transmission or buy a ""good enough"" car outright. 10 interest rate on a vehicle purchase is not very good. Not sure why you have a personal loan to handle this rather than an auto loan, but Ill guess you have a low credit score or not much credit history. Cost of a new transmission is usually 1,700  3,500. Not sure what vehicle were talking about, so lets make it 3,000 to be conservative. At your current interest rate, youll have paid another 1,450 in interest over the next 33 months just trying to pay off your underwater car. If you take your old car to a dealership and trade it in towards a ""new to you"" car, you might be able to roll your existing loan into a new loan. Now, Im not sure when you say personal loan if you mean an official loan from a bank or a personal loan from a friendfamilymember, so that could make a difference. Im also not sure if a dealership will be willing to recognize a personal loan in the transaction as Id wager theres no lien against the vehicle for them to worry about. But, if you can manage it, you may be able to get a lower overall interest rate. If you cant roll it into a new financing plan, then you need to assess if you can afford a new loan provided you even get approved on top of your existing finances. One big issue that will affect interest rates and approvals will be your down payment amount. The higher it is, the better interest rate youll receive. Ultimately, youre in a notsogreat position, but if your monthly budget is as you describe, then youll be fine after a few more years. The perils of buying a used car is that you never know what might happen. What if you dont repair your existing car, buy another car, and it breaks down in a year? Its all a bit of a gamble. Dont let your emotions get in the way of making a decision. You might be frustrated with your current vehicle, but if 3,000 of repairs makes it last 3 more years, by which time your current loan should be paid off, then youll be in a much better spot to finance a newer vehicle. Of course it would be much better to save up cash over that time and buy something outright, but thats not always feasible. Would you rather fix up your current car and keep working to pay down the debt, or, would you rather be rid of the car and put 3,000 down on a ""new to you"" car and take on an additional monthly debt? Theres no single right answer for you. First and foremost you need to assess your monthly cash flow and properly allocate the extra funds.

Married Couple  Open investment account Separate or Joined?,"I dont believe it makes a difference at the federal level  if you file taxes jointly, gains, losses, and dividends appear on the joint tax account. If you file separately, I assume the tax implications only appear on the owners tax return. Then the benefits might outweigh the costs, but only if you correctly predict market behavior and the behavior of your positions. For example, lets say you lose 30k in the market in one year, and your spouse makes 30k. If youre filing jointly, the loss washes out the gain, and you have no net taxes on the investment. If youre filing separately, you can claim 3k in loss the remaining 27k in loss is banked to future tax years, but your spouse pays taxes on 30k in gain.

Should the poor consider investing as a means to becoming rich? ,"What could a small guy with 100 do to make himself not poor To answer the question directly, not much. Short of investing in something at the exact moment before it goes bananas, then reinvesting into a bigger stock and bigger etc, its super high risk. A better way is to sacrifice some small things, less coffee, less smokes, less going out partying so that instead of having 100, you have 100 a week. This puts you into a situation where you can save enough to become a deposit on an appreciating asset choose your own asset class, property in AU for me. Take out a loan for as much as you can for your 100 a week payment and make it interest only with an offset against it, distributions from shares can either be reinvested or put into the offset or in the case of property, rent can be put against the offset, pretty soon you end up with a scenario where you have cash offsetting a loan down to nothing but you still have access to the cash, invest into another place and revalue your asset, you can take out any equity that has grown and put that also into your offset. Keep pulling equity and using the money from the offset as deposits on other assets it kind of works really well on property and within 15 years you can build an empire with a passive income to retire on. The biggest thing the rich guys get that the poor guys dont is that debt is GOOD, use someone elses money to buy an appreciating asset then when you pay it back eventually, you own the growth. Use debt to buy more debt for exponential growth. Of course, you need to also invest your time to research what you are investing in, you need to know when you make the decision to buy that it will appreciate, its no good just buying off a tip, you may as well drop your money on the horses if you want to play it like that.

My bank refused to do a charge back,"You cant make your bank do a charge back. This function is to assist with straight up fraud, not a customer service mistake. Think spoofed or stolen card or if a vendor intentionally acted fraudulently.

Trying to call back and giving up after a long hold time wont meet their standards. If banks started letting anyone unhappy with a vendor start doing charge backs, they would be doing nothing else all day. The issues youre describing has not reached the threshold for the bank to authorize a charge back. Comcast has local and regional offices, and you could go in person to speak with someone.

Investment for young expatriate professionals,"Thats a broad question, but I can throw some thoughts at you from personal experience. Im actually an Australian who has worked in a couple of companies but across multiple countries and Ive found out first hand that you have a wealth of opportunities that other people dont have, but you also have a lot of problems that other people wont have. First up, asset classes. Real estate is a popular asset class, but unless you plan on being in each of these countries for a minimum of one to two years, it would be seriously risky to invest in rental residential or commercial real estate. This is because it takes a long time to figure out each countrys particular set of laws around real estate, plus it will take a long time to get credit from the local bank institutions and to understand the local markets well enough to select a good location. This leaves you with the classics of stocks and bonds. You can buy stocks and bonds in any country typically. So you could have some stocks in a German company, a bond fund in France and maybe a mutual fund in Japan. This makes for interesting diversification, so if one country tanks, you can potentially be hedged in another. You also get to both benefit and be punished by foreign exchange movements. You might have made a killing on that stock you bought in Tokyo, but it turns out the Yen just fell by 15. Doh. And to top this off, you are almost certainly going to end up filling out tax returns in each country you have made money in. This can get horribly complicated, very quickly. As a person who has been dealing with the US tax system, I can tell you that this is painful and the US in particular tries to get a cut of your worldwide income. That said, keep in mind each country has different tax rates, so you could potentially benefit from that as well. My advice? Choose one country you suspect youll spend most of your life in and keep most of your assets there. Make a few purchases in other places, but minimize it.

In the best case scenario you will need an explanation letter of why you did this. In the worst case scenario the lender will want you to wait to get financing. Try and find a lender with NO FHA overages which means they dont put additional restrictions on giving you an FHA insured loan. That type of lender will be your best choice because they just follow FHA rules and dont add any additional requirements.,What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Does settlement of second mortgage count as short sale?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Buying a more expensive house as a tax shelter larger interest deduction?,"Two points You dont really get the full 10,000 annual interest as tax free income. Well you do, but you would have gotten a substantial amount of that anyway as the standard deduction. ...From the IRS.... Standard deduction The standard deduction for married couples filing a joint return is at 11,900 for 2012. The standard deduction for single individuals and married couples filing separate returns is 5,950 for 2012. The standard deduction for heads of household increases by 50 to 8,700 for 2012. so If you were married it wouldnt even make sense to claim the 10,000 mortgage interest deduction as the standard one is larger. It can make sense to do what you are talking about, but ultimately you have to decide what the effective interest rate on your mortgage is and if you can afford it. For instance. I might have a 5 mortgage. If I am in a 20 tax bracket it effectively is a 4 mortgage to me. Even though I am saving tax money I am still paying effectively 4. Ultimately the variables are too complex to generalize any hard and fast rules, but it often times does make sense.

"Shortsell, or try to rent out?","A short sale will be pretty bad for your credit report. It will linger for 7 years. This may ruin your opportunity to buy in the new area.

So the shortfall of 800mo after adjustment will reduce your borrowing power if you rent it out. In general this is the idea. You rent for a year, and buy into the new area. If you short sell after this, while your credit is trashed, you still have your new home, and 50K less debt. Disclaimer  There are those who question the ethics of this, a willing short sale.

Should I Use an Investment Professional?,"Ask yourself the same question for furniture making.

Why cant you just have someone invest for you and split the profits and losses with him?,"Why is nobody providing a service that is basically Give me your money. I will invest it as I see fit. A year later I will return the capital to you, plus half of any profits or losses. This means that if your capital under my management ends up turning a profit, I will keep half of those profits, but if I lose you money, I will cover half those losses. Because they can already make lots of money by just charging people an unconditional fee and not having to cover their losses. Why take on the risk of having to cover your losses when they can just take a percentage of your assets and stick you with any losses? In addition, as Charles E. Grant mentioned in a comment on another answer, if a person has both sufficient capital to cover your losses and sufficient confidence in their investing acumen that they dont think they will have to do so, they have little need for your money. Rather than take half the gains on your money, they will invest their own money they must have some, or else they cant guarantee your losses and take all the gains. Your scheme would only be plausible as a partnership between a person with investing skills but little capital, and another person with ample capital and less skill. In that case, the investment whiz could genuinely benefit from access to the bankrollers capital. As quid noted in chat, this does exist in the form of adhoc private equity arrangements between individuals. However, such a setup is unlikely to exist as an ""offtheshelf product"" marketed at retail investors, because financial institutions have more capital than any individual retail investor  and, more generally, anyone with sufficient skill to pull this off will at least in theory quickly accumulate enough capital that they can negotiate a less risky payment plan.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why cant you just have someone invest for you and split the profits and losses with him?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"As a 22yearold, how risky should I be with my 401k investments?","Current evidence is that, after you subtract their commission and the additional trading costs, actively managed funds average no better than index funds, maybe not as well. You can afford to take more risks at your age, assuming that it will be a long time before you need these funds  but I would suggest that means putting a high percentage of your investments in smallcap and largecap stock indexes.

Proscons for buying gold vs. saving money in an interestbased account?,"As Michael McGowan says, just because gold has gone up lots recently does not mean it will continue to go up by the same amount.

To try to answer this, I used the house price data from here, the 30 year fixed mortgages here and the US salary information from here. To calculate the ""ability to borrow"" I took the US hourly salary information, multiplied by 200012 to get a monthly salary. I completely arbitrarily assumed that 25 per cent of the monthly salary would be used on mortgage payments. I then used Excels ""PV"" Present Value function to calculate the present value of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage. The resulting graph is below.

What factors of a stock help determine its potential ,"Knowing the answer to this question is generally not as useful as it may seem. The stocks current price is the consensus of thousands of people who are looking at the many relevant factors dividend rate, growth prospects, volatility, risk, industry, etc. that determine its value. A stocks price is the markets valuation of the cash flows it entitles you to in the future. Researching a stocks value means trying to figure out if there is something relevant to these cash flows that the market doesnt know about or has misjudged. Pretty much anything we can list for you here that will affect a stocks price is something the market knows about, so its not likely to help you know if something is mispriced. Therefore its not useful to you. If you are not a true expert on how important the relevant factors are and how the market is reacting to them currently and often even if you are, then you are essentially guessing. How likely are you to catch something that the thousands of other investors have missed and how likely are you to miss something that other investors have understood? I dont view gambling as inherently evil, but you should be clear and honest with yourself about what you are doing if you are trying to outperform the market.

are there any special procedures for managing nonpetty cash?,"After talking to two CPAs it seems like managing it using an imprest system is the best idea. The base characteristic of an imprest system is that a fixed amount is reserved and later replenished as it runs low. This replenishment will come from another account source, e.g., petty cash will be replenished by cashing a cheque drawn on a bank account. Petty cash imprest system allows only the replenishment of the spend made. So, if you start the month with 100 in your petty cash float and spend 90 of that cash in the month, an amount of 90 will be then placed in your petty cash float to bring the balance of your petty cash float back to 100. The replenishment is credited to the primary cash account, usually a bank account Dr  Petty Cash ac, Cr  Bank ac and the debits will go to the respective expense accounts, based on the petty cash receipt dockets Dr Expense ac, Cr  Petty Cash ac. In a non imprest system where a fixed amount is issued every month, e.g., 100 every time cash is required, there is no incentive to ensure all money issued has been documented because when money is all spent a check for a fixed amount is issued. It is much more difficult to reconcile a non imprest system as you never know how much exactly should be in the float. In an imprest system the amount requested is documented, the documentation being the petty cash dockets and their associated receipts or invoices. So at all times you can check how much should be left in the petty cash float by deducting the amount spent from the opening petty cash float.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: are there any special procedures for managing nonpetty cash?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?","The answer is Discounted Cash Flows. Companies that dont pay dividends are, ostensibly reinvesting their cash at returns higher than shareholders could obtain elsewhere. They are reinvesting in productive capacity with the aim of using this greater productive capacity to generate even more cash in the future. This isnt just true for companies, but for almost any cashgenerating project. With a project you can purchase some type of productive assets, you may perform some kind of transformation on the good or not, with the intent of selling a product, service, or in fact the productive mechanism you have built, this productive mechanism is typically called a ""company"". What is the value of such a productive mechanism? Yes, its capacity to continue producing cash into the future. Under literally any scenario, discounted cash flow is how cash flows at distinct intervals are valued. A company that does not pay dividends now is capable of paying them in the future. Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend currently, but its cash flows have been reinvested over the years such that its current cash paying capacity has multiplied many thousands of times over the decades. This is why companies that have never paid dividends trade at higher prices. Microsoft did not pay dividends for many years because the cash was better used developing the company to pay cash flows to investors in later years. A companies value is the sum of its risk adjusted cash flows in the future, even when it has never paid shareholders a dime. If you had a piece of paper that obligated an entity such as the government to absolutely pay you 1,000 20 years from now, this 1,000 cash flows present value could be estimated using Discounted Cash Flow. It might be around 400, for example. But lets say you want to trade this promise to pay before the 20 years is up. Would it be worth anything? Of course it would. It would in fact typically go up in value barring heavy inflation until it was worth very close to 1,000 moments before its value is redeemed. Imagine that this ""promise to pay"" is much like a nondividend paying stock. Throughout its life it has never paid anyone anything, but over the years its value goes up. It is because the discounted cash flow of the 1,000 payout can be estimated at almost anytime prior to its payout.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

why do I need an emergency fund if I already have investments?,"My take on this is that this reduces your liquidity risk. Stocks, bonds and many other investment vehicles on secondary markets you may think of are highly liquid but they still require that markets are open and then an additional 35 business days to settle the transaction and for funds to make their way to your bank account. If you require funds immediately because of an emergency, this 35 business days which gets longer as weekends and holidays are in the way can cause a lot of discomfort which may be worth a small loss in potential ROI. Think of your car breaking down or a water pipe exploding in your home and having to wait for the stock sale to process before you can make the payment. Admittedly, you have other options such as margin loans and credit cards that can help absorb the shock in such cases but they may not be sufficient or cause you to pay interest or fees if left unpaid.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: why do I need an emergency fund if I already have investments?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

FICA was not withheld from my paycheck,"According to this section in Publication 15 Collecting underwithheld taxes from employees. If you withheld no income, social security, or Medicare taxes or less than the correct amount from an employees wages, you can make it up from later pay to that employee. But youre the one who owes the underpayment. Reimbursement is a matter for settlement between you and the employee. [...] it seems that if the employer withheld less than the correct amount of FICA taxes from you, it is still the employer who owes your FICA taxes to the government, not you. I do not believe there is a way for you, an employee not selfemployed, to directly pay FICA taxes to the government without going through the employer. The employer can deduct the underwithheld amount from you future paychecks assuming you still work for them, or settle it with you in some other way. In other words, you owe the employer, and the employer owes the government, but you do not directly owe the government. If they do deduct it from your future pay, then they can issue a corrected W2, to reflect the amount deducted from you.

There is no reason that she cant provide for her children on US50k per year. In all honesty it sounds like she has a mental health problem and needs to see a professional. You, as the exhusband, are probably not the right person to tell her that, though. If you really want to help her and are still on good terms with some friends or family members she trusts you could ask them to help her get help. They probably see the same mess that you and your kids do, but might need a little encouragement to act. The other option is if you sued for custody, based on living conditions, the possibility of losing her children and the child support might provide a much needed incentive to clean up her act.

Best ISA alternative ,"Your question is actually quite broad, so will try to split it into its key parts Yes, standard bank ISAs pay very poor rates of interest at the moment. They are however basically risk free and should track inflation. Any investment in the 67 return range at the moment will be linked to stock. Stock always carries large risks 50 swings in capital are pretty standard in the short run. In the long run it generally beats every other asset class by miles. If you cant handle those types of short terms swings, you shouldnt get involved. If you do want to invest in stock, there is a hefty ignorance tax waiting at every corner in terms of how brokers construct their fees. In a nutshell, there is a different best value broker in the UK for virtually every band of capital, and they make their money through people signing up when they are in range x, and not moving their money when they reach band y or just having a large marketing budget and screwing you from the start Nutmeg at 1 a year is def in this category. There isnt much of an obvious way around this if you are adamant you dont want to learn about it  the way the market is constructed is just a total predatory minefield for the complete novice. There are middle ground style investments between the two extremes you are looking at bonds, bond funds and mixes of bonds and small amounts of stock such as the Vanguard income or Conservative Growth funds outlined here, can return more than savings accounts with less risk than stocks, but again its a very diverse field thats hard to give specific advice about without knowing more about what your risk tolerance, timelines and aims are. If you do go down this or the pure stock fund route, it will need to be purchased via a broker in an ISA wrapper. The broker charges a platform fee, the fund charges a fund fee. In both cases you want these as low as possible. The Telegraph has a good heat map for the best value ISA platform providers by capital range here.

Can preventive health checkup be claimed as a separate expense from medical expenses?,"There are 2 different things, As per IT Act, one can get ""Medical Reimbursement"" upto Rs 15,000 which is tax free. The way it is supposed to work is an employee submits bill and employer will ""Reimburse"" upto Rs 15,000. So if one does not submit any bills, he does not get any money. If the employer has given the employee Rs 15,000 without any bills, it would have been taxed as per the tax bracket. In practise all employer factor the Rs 15,000 in the salary to the employee. If bills are submitted, then its tax free. If bill are not submitted, partially submitted, the difference is paid as ""Allowance"" and hence becomes taxable. Apart from above there is section 80D that provides additional rebate. Upto Rs 15,000 when health insurance is taken. Upto Rs 5,000 for Health checkup. Hence if you submit the details to your employer you will get rebate in tax, on Rs 5,000 it would be Rs 1,500. You would not get ""Reimbursement"".

Should I get a car loan before shopping for a car?,"You have a good start estimated max amount you will pay, estimated max down payment, and term Now go to your bankcredit union and apply for the loan.

The dealer doesnt have to know how much is loan. You also know from the loan commitment exactly how much your monthly payment will be in the worst case. If you have a car you want to trade in, get an written estimate that is good for a week or so. This lets you know how much you can get from selling the car.

What are NSCC illiquid charges?,"NSCC illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of lowpriced overthe counter OTC securities with low volumes. Open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3day settlement cycle. Open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm Basically, you cant hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid OTC stock without facing a fee. Youll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions. Open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3day settlement cycle. Open net sell quantity must be less than 10 percent of the 20day average volume If you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10 of the stocks average volume over the last 20 days, youll also be assessed a fee. The first link I included above is just an example, but it makes the important point you may still be assessed a fee for trading OTC stocks even if your account doesnt meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm, not the individual client. This means that if other investors with your broker, or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm, purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual OTC stock at the same time, all of your accounts may face fees, even though individually, you dont exceed the limits. Technically, these fees are assessed to the clearing firm, not the individual investor, but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker and possibly add other charges as well, and the broker will charge a fee to the individual accounts that triggered the restriction. Also, remember that when buying OTCpink sheet stocks, your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy fromsell to. If you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future, but there arent enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you, you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price, or even at all.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are NSCC illiquid charges?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Im selfemployed with my own LLC. How should I pay myself, given my situation?","Youre conflating LLC with Corporation. Theyre different animals. LLC does not have ""S"" or ""C"" designations, those are just for corporations. I think what youre thinking about is electing pass through status with the IRS. This is the easiest way to go. The company can pay you at irregular intervals in irregular amounts. The IRS doesnt care about these payments. The company will show profit or loss at the end of the year those payments to you arent expenses and dont reduce your profit. You report this on your schedule C and pay tax on that amount. Your state tax authority will have its own rules about how this works. Alternatively you can elect to have the LLC taxed as a corporation. I dont know of a good reason why someone in your situation would do this, but Im not an accountant so there may be reasons out there. My recommendation is to get an accountant to prepare your taxes. At least once  if your situation is the same next year you can use the previous years forms to figure out what you need to fill in. The investment of a couple hundred dollars is worthwhile. On the question of buying a home in the next couple of years... yes, it does affect things. Pass through status? Probably doesnt affect much. If all of your income is coming from selfemployment, be prepared for hassles when you are shopping for a mortgage. You can ask around, maybe you have a friendly loan officer at your credit union who knows your history. But in general they will want to see at least two years of selfemployment tax returns.

"For very highnet worth individuals, does it make sense to not have insurance?","There is an economic, a social and a psychological side to the decision whether to buy insurance or not, and if yes, which one. Economically, as you say already in your question, an insurance is on average a net loss for the insured. The key word here is ""average"". If you know that there are many cancer cases in your family buy health insurance by all means its a sound investment. If you are a reckless driver make sure you have extensive coverage on your liability insurance. But absent such extra risks Independently of somebodys wealth insurance should be limited to covering catastrophic events. What is often overlooked is that the insurance by all means should really cover those catastrophic events. For example the car liability minimums in many states are not sufficient. The typical upper middle class person could probably pay the 15k30k10k required in Arizona with a loan on their house but a really catastrophic accident is simply not covered and would totally ruin that person and their family. Insuring petty damage is a common mistake economically speaking, all insurances should have deductibles which are as high as one could afford to pay without feeling too much pain. That ""pain"" qualification has an economical and a social aspect. Of course any risk which materialized is an economical damage of some kind perhaps now I cant buy the PS4, or the diamond ring, or the car, or the house, or the island which had caught my eye. I could probably do all these things, just perhaps without some extras, even if I had paid for insurance so if I dont want to live with the risk to lose that possibility I better buy insurance. Another economical aspect is that the money may not be available without selling assets, possibly on short notice and hence not for the best price. Then an insurance fee takes the role of paying for a permanent backup credit line and should not be more expensive than that. The social aspect is that even events which wouldnt strictly ruin a person might still force them to, say, sell their Manhattan penthouse no more parties! or cancel their country club membership. That is a social pain which is probably to be avoided. Another socioeconomic aspect is that you may have a relationship to the person selling you the insurance. Perhaps he buys his car at your dealership? Perhaps he is your golf buddy? Then the insurance may be a good investment. It is only borderline bad to begin with any benefits move the line into the profit zone. The psychological aspect is that an insurance buys peace of mind, and that often seems to be the most important benefit. A dart hits the flat screen? Hey, it was insured. Junior totals the Ferrari? Hey, it was insured.

"For net worth, should I value physical property at my cost to replace it, or the amount I could get for selling it?","Valuation by definition is what an item is worth, not what you paid for it. Net worth should be market value for fixed assets or ""capital"" goods. I would consider this cars, real property, furniture, jewelry, appliances, tools, etc. Everything else can be valued by liquidation value. You can use valuation guides for tax deductions as a way to guide your valuation. Insurance companies usually just pick a percentage of your homes value as a guesstimate for content value. I could see doing this as a way to guide purchase decisions for appliances, cars or the like. But if you are trying to figure out the market value of your socks and underwear, I would argue that youre doing something thats a little silly.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: For net worth, should I value physical property at my cost to replace it, or the amount I could get for selling it?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

How can I stop wasting food?,"You want to combine a set of techniques to avoid throwing food away. Consider setting aside a weekend day or other nonbusy time to do some food prep. Check to see if there is anything in the fridge that needs to be used quickly and prioritize meals that use that item. Make a weekly menu and get your groceries. Chop all the vegetables and fruits you need for the weeks meals. Cook meats that can be cooked in advance. Chefs call the concept of having everything ready for making a meal ""mis en place."" Try to do yours in advance to energize you for cooking and also make you more likely to cook on those nights youve been at the office late. Get to know and love your freezer. Buy frozen meat in bulk and portion individually wrap 12 lb blocks of ground beef and chicken pieces in foil then store in freezer bags, for example. Get frozen packaged fish fillets for seafood. Boil a whole chicken, shred the meat, and have on hand for easy meals like tacos, enchiladas, chicken pot pie, pasta, etc. Do the same with beef roasts or pork shoulder for pulled pork, etc. Freeze vegetables and fruits if you cant use them in time or buy frozen vegetables to begin with. You can even consider making dumplings like perogis or pelmeni and freezing for a homemade alternative to a frozen food aisle meal. You can even go all the way with freezer cooking. Cook with shelfstable items. Rice, pasta, beans, lentils, canned goods, and other items can be made into major components of a meal. When you do buy something perishable that doesnt freeze well, try to utilize it in more than one of your meals for the week. This works well for items like fresh herbs. If you dont want to spend a lot of time cooking, a source like stonesoup is a great place to start  many recipes there can be finished in under 10 minutes, most are five ingredients or less, and all are tasty and good for you.

First time investor and online brokerage accounts,"Littleadv has given you excellent general advice, but to my mind, the most important part of it all and the path which I will strongly recommend you follow, is the suggestion to look into a mutual fund. I would add even more strongly, go to a mutual fund company directly and make an investment with them directly instead of making the investment through a brokerage account. Pick an index fund with low expenses, e.g. there are SP 500 index funds available with expenses that are a fraction of 1. However, many also require minimum investments on the order of 2500 or 3000 except for IRA accounts. At this time, your goal should be to reduce expenses as much as possible because expenses, whether they be in brokerage fees which may be directly visible to you or mutual fund expenses which are invisible to you, are what will eat away at your return far more than the difference between the returns of various investments.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: First time investor and online brokerage accounts?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Would the purchase of a car for a business through the use of a business loan be considered a business expense?,"You dont say what country you live in. If its the U.S., the IRS has very specific rules for business use of a car. See, for starters at least, httpwww.irs.govpublicationsp463ch04.html. The gist of it is If you use the car 100 for business purposes, you NEVER use it to drive to the grocery store or to your friends house, etc, then it is a deductible business expense. If you use a car party for business use and partly for personal use, than you can deduct the portion of the expense of the car that is for business use, but not the portion that is for personal use. So basically, if you use the car 75 for business purposes and 25 for personal use, you can deduct 75 of the cost and expenses. You can calculate the business use by, a Keeping careful records of how much you spent on gas, oil, repairs, etc, tracking the percentage of business use versus percentage of personal use, and then multiplying the cost by the percentage business use and that is the amount you can deduct or b Use the standard mileage allowance, so many cents per mile, which changes every year. Note that the fact that you paid for the car from a business account has absolutely nothing to do with it. If it did, then everyone could create a small business, open a business account, pay all their bills from there, and all their personal expenses would magically become business expenses. Just by the way If you are going to try to stretch the rules on your taxes, business use of a car or personal computer or expenses for a home office are the worst place to do it. The IRS knows that cars and computers are things that can easily be used for either personal or business purposes and so they keep a special eye out on these.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Would the purchase of a car for a business through the use of a business loan be considered a business expense?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"If a companys assets are worth more than its market cap, can one say the shares must be undervalued?","Look at Pricebook value and there are more than a few stocks that may have a PB under 1 so this does happen. There are at least a couple of other factors you arent considering here Current liabilities  How much money is the company losing each quarter that may cause it to sell repeatedly. If the company is burning through 100 millionquarter that asset is only going to keep the lights on for another 2.5 years so consider what assumptions you make about the companys cash flow here. The asset itself  Is the price really fixed or could it be flexible? Could the asset seen as being worth 1 billion today be worth much less in another year or two?

What are the pros and cons of buying a house just to rent it out?,"There are actually a few questions you are asking here. I will try and address each individually. Down Payment What you put down cant really be quantified in a dollar amount here. 5k10k means nothing. If the house costs 20k then youre putting 50 down. What is relevant is the percent of the purchase price youre putting down. That being said, if you go to purchase a property as an investment property something you wont be moving into then you are much more likely to be putting a down payment much closer to 2025 of the purchase price. However, if you are capable of living in the property for a year usually the limitation on federal loans then you can pay much less. Around 3.5 has been my experience. The Process Your plan is sound but I would HIGHLY suggest looking into what it means to be a landlord. This is not a decision to be taken lightly. You need to know the tenant landlord laws in your city AND state. You need to call a tax consultant and speak to them about what you will be charging for rent, and how much you should withhold for taxes. You also should talk to them about what write offs are available for rental properties. ""Breaking Even"" with rent and a mortgage can also mean loss when tax time comes if you dont account for repairs made. Financing Your first rental property is the hardest to get going if you dont have experience as a landlord. Most lenders will allow you to use the potential income of a property to qualify for a loan once you have established yourself as a landlord. Prior to that though you need to have enough income to afford the mortgage on your own. So, what that means is that qualifying for a loan is highly related to your debt to income ratio. If your properties are self sustaining and you still work 40 hours a week then your ability to qualify in the future shouldnt be all that impacted. If anything it shows that you are a responsible credit manager. Conclusion I cant stress enough to do YOUR OWN research. Dont go off of what your friends are telling you. People exaggerate to make them seem like they are higher on the socioeconomic ladder then they really are. They also might have chicken little syndrome and try to discourage you from making a really great choice. I run into this all the time. People feel like they cant do something or theyre to afraid so you shouldnt be able to either. If you need advice go to a professional or read a book.

Is it possible to influence a companys actions by buying stock?,"Yes and no. This really should be taught at junior school level in a capitalist country but that is a different argument. A company is influenced by its shareholders but not in the way you are hoping. This is the only area where a Company must behave democratically with one share one vote. If you own one share in a company specifically a voting share, then you are entitled to attend an AGM where you will have a vote on issues presented by the board. You might have an opportunity to make a statement or ask a question at the AGM, but I wouldnt rely on it. You will not be able to influence the companies behavior beyond that unless you control enough shares to influence the board. Notice I said control not own. If you get other shareholders to agree to vote with you, then you effectively control their shares. Shareholders are there to get a return on their investment, so you must convince them that they will get a better return by agreeing with you then by following the board that they put there!. Convince them that for example a trespass lawsuit will rob the company of more value then the profit to be made and they might agree to not trespass. Morals, ethics, justice etc., are human attributes and since most shareholders are other corporations not humans, they have no place in your arguments with one exception Goodwill is a value that appears on a balance sheet and you might be able to use emotional arguments to show that there is a risk of a loss of goodwill from the proposed actions. You can make your argument stronger by generating media pressure on customers and suppliers of the company to make critical public comments.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is it possible to influence a companys actions by buying stock?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why invest in becoming a landlord?,"As a landlord for 14 years with 10 properties, I can give a few pointers be able and skilled enough to perform the majority of maintenance because this is your biggest expense otherwise. it will shock you how much maintenance rental units require. dont invest in real estate where the localitystate favors the tenant e.g., New York City in disputes. A great state is Florida where you can have someone evicted very quickly. require a minimum credit score of 620 for all tenants over 21. This seems to be the magic number that keeps most of the nightmare tenants out makes sure they have a job nearby that pays at least three times their annual rent every renewal, adjust your tenants rent to be approximately 5 less than going rates in your area. Use Zillow as a guide. Keeping just below market rates keeps tenants from moving to cheaper options. do not rent to anyone under 30 and single. Trust me trust me trust me. you cant legally do this officially, but do it while offering another acceptable reason for rejection theres always something you could say thats legitimate bad credit, or chose another tenant, etc. charge a 5 late fee starting 10 days after the rent is due. 20 days late, file for eviction to let the tenant know you mean business. Dont sink yourself too much in debt, put enough money down so that you start profitable. I made the mistake of burying myself and I havent barely been able to breathe for the entire 14 years. Its just now finally coming into profitability. Dont get adjustable rate or balloon loans under any circumstances. Fixed 30 only. You can pay it down in 20 years and get the same benefits as if you got a fixed 20, but you will want the option of paying less some months so get the 30 and treat it like a 20. dont even try to find your own tenants. Use a realtor and take the 10 cost hit. They actually save you money because they can show your place to a lot more prospective tenants and it will be rented much sooner. Empty place  empty wallet. Also, block out the part of the realtors agreementtolease where it states they keep getting the 10 every year thereafter. Most realtors will go along with this just to get the first year, but if they dont, find another realtor. buy all in the same community if you can, then you can use the same vendor list, the same lease agreement, the same realtor, the same documentation, spreadsheets, etc. Much much easier to have everything a clone. They say dont put all your eggs in one basket, but the reality is, running a bunch of properties is a lot of work, and the more similar they are, the more you can duplicate your work for free.

What is a margincall and how are they enforced?,"Simplest way to answer this is that on margin, one is using borrowed assets and thus there are strings that come with doing that. Thus, if the amount of equity left gets too low, the broker has a legal obligation to close the position which can be selling purchased shares or buying back borrowed shares depending on if this is a long or short position respectively. Investopedia has an example that they walk through as the call is where you are asked to either put in more money to the account or the position may be closed because the broker wants their money back. What is Maintenance Margin? A maintenance margin is the required amount of securities an investor must hold in his account if he either purchases shares on margin, or if he sells shares short. If an investors margin balance falls below the set maintenance margin, the investor would then need to contribute additional funds to the account or liquidate stocks in the account to bring the account back to the initial margin requirement. This request is known as a margin call. As discussed previously, the Federal Reserve Board sets the initial margin requirement currently at 50. The Federal Reserve Board also sets the maintenance margin. The maintenance margin, the amount of equity an investor needs to hold in his account if he buys stock on margin or sells shares short, is 25. Keep in mind, however, that this 25 level is the minimum level set, brokerage firms can increase, but not decrease this level as they desire. Example Determining when a margin call would occur. Assume that an investor had purchased 500 shares of Newcos stock. The shares were trading at 50 when the transaction was executed. The initial margin requirement on the account was 70 and the maintenance margin is 30. Assume no transaction costs. Determine the price at which the investor will receive a margin call. Answer Calculate the price as follows 50 1 0.70  21.43 1  0.30 A margin call would be received when the price of Newcos stock fell below 21.43 per share. At that time, the investor would either need to deposit additional funds or liquidate shares to satisfy the initial margin requirement. Most people dont want ""Margin Calls"" but stocks may move in unexpected ways and this is where there are mechanisms to limit losses, especially for the brokerage firm that wants to make as much money as possible. Cancel what trade? No, the broker will close the position if the requirement isnt kept. Basically think of this as a way for the broker to get their money back if necessary while following federal rules. This would be selling in a long position or buying in a short sale situation. The Margin Investor walks through an example where an email would be sent and if the requirement isnt met then the position gets exited as per the law.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is a margincall and how are they enforced?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Most effective Fundamental Analysis indicators for market entry,"Unfortunately, there is very little data supporting fundamental analysis or technical analysis as appropriate tools to ""time"" the market. I will be so bold to say that technical analysis is meaningless. On the other hand, fundamental analysis has some merits. For example, the realization that CDOs were filled with toxic mortgages can be considered a product of fundamental analysis and hence provided traders with a directional assumption to buy CDSs. However, there is no way to tell when there is a good or bad time to buy or sell. The market behaves like a random 5050 motion. There are many reasons for this and interestingly, there are many fundamentally sound companies that take large dips for no reason at all. Depending on your goal, you can either believe that this volatility will smooth over long periods and that the market has generally positive drift. On the other hand, I feel that the appropriate approach is to remain active. You will be able to mitigate the large downswings by simply staying small and diversifying  not in the sense of traditional finance but rather looking for uncorrelated products. Remember, volatility brings higher levels of correlation. My second suggestion is to look towards products like options to provide a method of shaping your PL  giving up upside by selling calls against a long equity position is a great example.

Death and Capital Gains Taxes United States,"My understanding is that when you die, the stocks are sold and then the money is given to the beneficiary or the stock is repurchased in the beneficiaries name. This is wrong, and the conclusion you draw from michaels otherwise correct answer follows your false assumption. You seem to understand the Estate Tax federal threshold. Jersey would have its own, and I have no idea how it works there. If the decedent happened to trade in the tax year prior to passing, normal tax rules apply. Now, if the executor chooses to sell off and liquidate the estate to cash, theres no further taxable gain, a 5M portfolio can have millions in long term gain, but the step up basis pretty much negates all of it. If thats the case, the beneficiaries arent likely to repurchase those shares, in fact, they might not even know what the list of stocks was, unless they sifted through the asset list. But, that sale was unnecessary, assets can be divvied up and distributed inkind, each beneficiary getting their fraction of the number of shares of each stock. And then your share of the 5M has a stepped up basis, meaning if you sell that day, your gains are near zero. You might owe a few dollars for whatever the share move in the time passing between the step up date and date you sell. I hope that clarifies your misunderstanding.

Can my employer limit my maximum 401k contribution amount below the IRS limit?,"Highly Compensated Employee Rules Aim to Make 401ks Fair would be the piece that I suspect you are missing here. I remember hearing of this rule when I worked in the US and can understand why it exists. A key quote from the article You wouldnt think the prospect of getting money from an employer would be nervewracking. But those jittery coworkers are highly compensated employees HCEs concerned that they will receive a refund of excess 401k contributions because their plan failed its discrimination test. A refund means they will owe more income tax for the current tax year. Geersk a pseudonym, who is also an HCE, is in information services and manages the computers that process his firms 401k plan. 401k  Wikipedia reference on this To help ensure that companies extend their 401k plans to lowpaid employees, an IRS rule limits the maximum deferral by the companys ""highly compensated"" employees, based on the average deferral by the companys nonhighly compensated employees. If the less compensated employees are allowed to save more for retirement, then the executives are allowed to save more for retirement. This provision is enforced via ""nondiscrimination testing"". Nondiscrimination testing takes the deferral rates of ""highly compensated employees"" HCEs and compares them to nonhighly compensated employees NHCEs. An HCE in 2008 is defined as an employee with compensation of greater than 100,000 in 2007 or an employee that owned more than 5 of the business at any time during the year or the preceding year.[13] In addition to the 100,000 limit for determining HCEs, employers can elect to limit the toppaid group of employees to the top 20 of employees ranked by compensation.[13] That is for plans whose first day of the plan year is in calendar year 2007, we look to each employees prior year gross compensation also known as Medicare wages and those who earned more than 100,000 are HCEs. Most testing done now in 2009 will be for the 2008 plan year and compare employees 2007 plan year gross compensation to the 100,000 threshold for 2007 to determine who is HCE and who is a NHCE. The threshold was 110,000 in 2010 and it did not change for 2011. The average deferral percentage ADP of all HCEs, as a group, can be no more than 2 percentage points greater or 125 of, whichever is more than the NHCEs, as a group. This is known as the ADP test. When a plan fails the ADP test, it essentially has two options to come into compliance. It can have a return of excess done to the HCEs to bring their ADP to a lower, passing, level. Or it can process a ""qualified nonelective contribution"" QNEC to some or all of the NHCEs to raise their ADP to a passing level. The return of excess requires the plan to send a taxable distribution to the HCEs or reclassify regular contributions as catchup contributions subject to the annual catchup limit for those HCEs over 50 by March 15 of the year following the failed test. A QNEC must be an immediately vested contribution. The annual contribution percentage ACP test is similarly performed but also includes employer matching and employee aftertax contributions. ACPs do not use the simple 2 threshold, and include other provisions which can allow the plan to ""shift"" excess passing rates from the ADP over to the ACP. A failed ACP test is likewise addressed through return of excess, or a QNEC or qualified match QMAC. There are a number of ""safe harbor"" provisions that can allow a company to be exempted from the ADP test. This includes making a ""safe harbor"" employer contribution to employees accounts. Safe harbor contributions can take the form of a match generally totaling 4 of pay or a nonelective profit sharing totaling 3 of pay. Safe harbor 401k contributions must be 100 vested at all times with immediate eligibility for employees. There are other administrative requirements within the safe harbor, such as requiring the employer to notify all eligible employees of the opportunity to participate in the plan, and restricting the employer from suspending participants for any reason other than due to a hardship withdrawal.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Stochastic Oscillator for Financial Analysis,"When using the Stochastic Indicator your basic aim is to buy go long when the stochastic becomes oversold goes below 20 and then the K line crosses above the D line at a market low, and to sell go short when the stochastic becomes overbought goes above 80 and then the K line crosses below the D line at a market high. Other indicators or candlestick patters can also be used to further confirm the trade. Below is a chart of a trade I recently took on GUD.AX using the Slow Stochastic in combination with support and resistance levels as well as a candlestick pattern. When I conducted my stock search on the evening of 28th July 2015, GUD was one of the results from the search that I particularly liked. The Slow Stochastic had just made a crossover in the oversold area just as the price was bouncing off its recent lows at the support line. But what I really like about this opportunity was that there was also a bullish reversal candle a Hammer at this short term market bottom. The high for the day was 8.34, so I placed a stop buy order to buy the stock tomorrow if the price opened or moved above this high of today. So I would only buy if the stock hit or moved above 8.35 during the next days trading. So if the stock opened and stayed below the previous days high I would not buy the stock and my order would be canceled at the end of the day. This is very important because it stops you from getting into trades that dont go in the direction you want. If this happens then you could check the chart again after market close to see if it is still worthwhile to place a new order for the next day. On the 29th July 2015 the stock did open higher at 8.42 which is where my order got executed and closed at 8.46. So I ended up buying slightly above my target price but it did move higher on the day, so a successful entry overall. I had placed my initial stop loss at 8.09 just below the low of the previous day of 8.10. If the trade had gone against me in the following days the most I would have lost was 1 of my total account capital. My target for this trade was 9.86 just below the resistance line near 10, which would represent a 5 gain against my total account capital or approx. 16.7 gain on the trade. So my win to loss ratio was 51. As you can see from the chart, the next day gapped up at the open and prices continued moving up strongly during the day. The next day was a slightly negative day, and then a few days later, on the 5th August 2015 my target price of 9.86 was reached with a high of 9.88 for that day, so my order was closed for a total profit of 16.7 on the face value of the trade. However, as I bought on margin using CFDs my actual profit on the initial margin I had invested was 167. My total time in the trade was 7 days, and I spent about an hour in the evening doing my searches and placing my orders, then less than 10 minutes managing the trade each evening after market close. The stock did go up a bit further after my profit target was reached, but the day after that the price started to fall as the price hit the resistance line and the Slow Stochastic did a crossover in the overbought area. Overall, this was a very ideal trade and I was very happy with it. Not all my trades reach my profit targets and I may get stopped out at a smaller profit or I might make a small loss as I move my stops up as the price moves up. The key to successful trading over the long term is to keep you losses small and let your profits run with my longer term trend trading I dont have profit targets and let my profits run until I get stopped out, but with my shorter term trading I do use a profit target usually 5 or 6 times the size of my initial stop. If you have an average win to average loss ratio of 31 or higher and have a success rate of 50 winners you will make money over the long term.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Stochastic Oscillator for Financial Analysis?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"What are my options for paying off the large balance of my federal, high interest student loans?","As someone with a lot of student loan debt, I can relate  the first thing you should do is read the promissory note on your current loans  there might be information there you can use. For govt loans stafford, etc made after July 1, 2006 the interest rate is going to be fixed and even a federal direct consolidation is not going to lower the rates themselves. If anything, consolidation will just increase the repayment period, which means youll end up paying more in the long run. Most private Loans usually offer variable interest rates, which today are quite low. But unless your financial situation is very comfortable and stable, consolidating out of federally guaranteed loans into private loans might not be the best path. You might lose options like deferment, forbearance, and maybe even things like a death benefit if you die, your loans die with you. related  if you have a cosigner you dont get that death benefit! But refinancing into a variable rate private loan is going to push a lot of risk to you in terms of interest rate inflation, etc. Most financial professionals will agree that interest rates can only go up in the long run. Keep in mind, student loans are completely unsecured  meaning lenders are taking a fairly large risk in loaning money and probably why the fed govt has to guarantee most of them. Ive heard of people borrowing against their home equity to pay down student loan debt  but I cant think of a reason youd want to substitute secured for unsecured debt and possibly lose the loan interest tax deduction. The bottom line is youre unlikely to find an alternative lending source at a lower interest rate for an unsecured student loan. Another option may be the income based repayment plan. If you qualify, it caps student loan monthly payments at 15 of your discretionary income discretionary is your income minus whatever the poverty threshold income amount is. And if that 15 doesnt even cover the interest on the loans, the govt picks up the tab for the difference for up to 3 years. You have to requalify every year by sending in all sorts of documentation, but if you somehow stay on IBR for 25 years, your loans are then forgiven. Obviously the downside here is that you are probably paying little to no principal, but if you do the math and determine that your IBR payment would be next to nothing, and your current situation is barely paying interestonly... well, maybe IBR isnt a bad thing for a couple of years or 25 if you think you will never have a larger income. Personally, I went through all these options as well and decided that my best option was to just earn more money... a 2nd job or side project here and there helps me pay down the debt faster, and with less risk, than moving to private variable rate loans.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are my options for paying off the large balance of my federal, high interest student loans?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

How can I investigate historical effect of Rebalancing on Return and Standard Deviation?,"To answer your question directly.. you can investigate by using google or other means to look up research done in this area. Theres been a bunch of it Heres an example of search terms that returns a wealth of information. effectofperiodicrebalancingonportfolioreturn Id especially look for stuff that appears to be academic papers etc, and then raid the references section of those. Look for stuff published in industry journals such as ""Journal of Portfolio Management"" as an example. If you want to try out different models yourself and see what works and what doesnt, this Monte Carlo Simulator might be something you would find useful The basic theory for those that dont know is that various parts of a larger market do not usually move in perfect lockstep, but go through cycles.. one year tech might be hot, the next year its healthcare. Or for an international portfolio, one year korea might be doing fantastic only to slow down and have another country perform better the next year. So the idea of rebalancing is that since these things tend to be cyclic, you can get a higher return if you sell part of a slice that is doing well e.g. sell at the high and invest it in one that is not buy at the low Because you do this based on some criteria, it helps circumvent the human tendency to hold on to a winner too long how many times have you heard someone say but its doing so well, why do I want to sell now""? presuming trends will continue and they will lose out on future gains, only to miss the peak and ride the thing down back into mediocrity. Depending on the volatility of the specific market, and the various slices, using re balancing can get you a pretty reasonable lift above the market average, for relatively low risk. generally the more volatile the market, such as say an emerging markets portfolio the more opportunity for lift. I looked into this myself a number of years back, the concensus I came was that the most effective method was to rebalance based on need rather than time. Need is defined as one or more of the slices in your portfolio being more than 8 above or below the average. So you use that as the trigger. How you rebalance depends to some degree on if the portfolio is taxable or not. If in a tax deferred account, you can simply sell off whatever is above baseline and use it to buy up the stuff that is below. If you are subject to taxes and dont want to trigger any short term gains, then you may have to be more careful in terms of what you sell. Alternatively if you are adding funds to the portfolio, you can alter how your distribute the new money coming into the portfolio in order to bring up whatever is below the baseline which takes a bit more time, but incurs no tax hit The other question is how will you slice a given market? by company size? by sectors such as techfinanceindustrialhealthcare, by geographic regions?",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can I investigate historical effect of Rebalancing on Return and Standard Deviation?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

ETF SP 500 with Reinvested Dividend,"What you seem to want is a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP. Thats typically offered by the broker, not by the ETF itself. Essentially this is a discounted purchase of new shares when youre dividend comes out. As noted in the answer by JoeTaxpayer, youll still need to pay tax on the dividend, but that probably wont be a big problem unless youve got a lot of dividends. Youll pay that out of some other funds when its due. All DRIPs not just for ETFs have potential to complicate computation of your tax basis for eventual sale, so be aware of that. It doesnt have to be a showstopper for you, but its something to consider before you start. Its probably less of a problem now than it used to be since brokers now have to report your basis on the 1099B in the year of sale, reducing your administrative burden if you trust them to get it right. Heres a list of brokerages that were offering this from a topofthesearchlist article that I found online Some brokerages, including TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Scottrade, Schwab and, to a lesser extent, Etrade, offer ETF DRIPsnocost dividend reinvestment programs.

I almost didnt included but I thought the wide availability at least as of the time of the articles posting was more interesting than any specific broker on it. Youll want to do some research before you choose a broker to do this.

If the company bought a computer that they loan to you to do occasional work for them, theres no reason you couldnt take the computer home and have that company retain ownership of the property. They could still expense the depreciation of the computer without giving it to you. If it were a car though, you would have to count mileage for personal use as income.

Why should one only contribute up to the employers match in a 401k?,"Unfortunately, I missed most of segment and I didnt get to understand the Why? To begin with, Cramer is an entertainer and his business is pushing stocks. If you put money into mutual funds which most 401k plans limit your investments to, then you are not purchasing his product. Also, many 401k plans have limited selections of funds, and many of those funds are not good performers. While his stockpicking track record is much better than mine, his isnt that great. He does point out that there are a lot of fees mostly hidden in 401k accounts. If you read your companys 5500 filing especialy Schedule A, you can determine just how much your plan administrators are paying themselves. If paying excessive fees is your concern, then you should be rolling over your 401k into your IRA when you quit or the employermatch vests, which ever is later. Finally, Cramer thinks that most of his audience will max out their IRA contributions and have only a little bit left for their 401k.

How much is inflation?,"To add to MrChristers answer Canada also has a Consumer Price Index CPI used to measure inflation that is distinct and separate from that maintained by the United States. There are differences in inflation between the U.S. and Canada because our currencies are different, and there may be different items in the ""basket"" of goods that constitutes the index. You can find current information on the Canadian CPI at Statistics Canada, here Latest release from the Consumer Price Index. Also, the Bank of Canada  our central bank  maintains a free online Inflation Calculator. The BoCs inflation calculator is handy because you can enter a dollar amount for a past date and it will figure out what that would be in todays dollars. For instance, 100 in 1970 dollars had the same purchasing power under the CPI as 561.76 in 2009 dollars! And youre right  if you get a salary increase that is less than the rate of inflation, then in theory you have lost purchasing power. So, anybody really looking for a raise ought to make an effort to get more than the increase in CPI. Of course, some employers are counting on you not knowing that, because any increase thats less than CPI is effectively a salary decrease which could mean more profit for them, if they are able to increase their prices  revenues at inflation or better. Finally, consider that salary  wage increases also contribute to inflation! Perhaps youve heard of the wageprice inflation spiral.

Advice on lowrisk longterm strategy for extra cash?,"So, you have 100k to invest, want a lowmaintenance investment, and personal finance bores you to death.

Are mutual funds safe from defaults?,"There is a measure of protection for investors. It is not the level of protection provided by FDIC or NCUA but it does exist Securities Investor Protection Corporation What SIPC Protects SIPC protects against the loss of cash and securities  such as stocks and bonds  held by a customer at a financiallytroubled SIPCmember brokerage firm. The limit of SIPC protection is 500,000, which includes a 250,000 limit for cash. Most customers of failed brokerage firms when assets are missing from customer accounts are protected. There is no requirement that a customer reside in or be a citizen of the United States. A nonU.S. citizen with an account at a brokerage firm that is a member of SIPC is treated the same as a resident or citizen of the United States with an account at a brokerage firm that is a member of SIPC. SIPC protection is limited. SIPC only protects the custody function of the broker dealer, which means that SIPC works to restore to customers their securities and cash that are in their accounts when the brokerage firm liquidation begins. SIPC does not protect against the decline in value of your securities. SIPC does not protect individuals who are sold worthless stocks and other securities. SIPC does not protect claims against a broker for bad investment advice, or for recommending inappropriate investments. It is important to recognize that SIPC protection is not the same as protection for your cash at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured banking institution because SIPC does not protect the value of any security. Investments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market value. SIPC was not created to protect these risks. That is why SIPC does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks, bonds and other investment falls for any reason.

"For a car, would you pay cash, finance for 0.9 or lease for 0.9?","While this question is old and I generally agree with the answers given I think theres another angle that needs a little illuminating insurance. If you go with an 84 month loan your car will likely be worth less than the amount owed for substantially all of the entire 84 month loan period this will be exacerbated if you put zero down and include the taxes and fees in the amount borrowed. Your lender will require you to carry full comprehensivecollisionliability coverage likely with a low maximum deductible. While the car is underwater it will probably also be a good idea to carry gap insurance because the last thing you want to do is write a check to your lender to shore up the loan to value deficit if the thing is totaled. These long term car loans Ive seen as high as 96 months are a bear when it comes to depreciation and related insurance costs. There is more to this decision than the interest calculation. Obviously, if you had the cash at the front of this decision presumably youll have the cash later to pay off the loan at your convenience.

How to find historical stock price for a delisted or defunct company?,"Such data is typically only available from paid sources due to the amount of research involved in determining the identity of delisted securities, surviving entities in merger scenarios, company name changes, symbol changes, listing venue changes, research of all capital events such as splits, and to ensure that the data coverage is complete. Many stocks that are delisted from a major exchange due to financial difficulties are still publicly tradeable companies with their continuing to trade as ""OTC"" shares. Some large companies even have periods where they traded for a period of their history as OTC. This happened to NYSENAV Navistar from Feb 2007 to July 2008, where they were delisted due to accounting statement inaccuracies and auditor difficulties. In the case of Macromedia, it was listed on NASDAQ 13 Dec 1993 and had its final day of trading on 2 Dec 2005. It had one stock split 21 with exdate of 16 Oct 1995 and no dividends were ever paid. Other companies are harder to find. For example, the bankrupt General Motors was NYSEGM became Motoros Liquidation Corp OTCMTLQQ and traded that way for almost 21 months before finally delisting. In mergers, there are in two or more entities  one surviving entity and one or more delisted entity. In demergersspinoffs there are two or more entities  one that continues the capital structure of the original company and the other newly formed spunoff entity. Just using the names of the companies is no indication of its history. For example, due to monopoly considerations, ATT were forced to spinoff multiple companies in 1984 and effectively became 75 smaller. One of the companies they spunoff was Southwestern Bell Corporation, which became SBC Communications in 1995. In 2005 SBC took over its former parent company and immediately changed its name to ATT.

What is an effective way to invest in electric car industry?,"At this time I would say that the electric car industry as a whole is too new to be able to invest in it as a sector. There are only a handful of companies that focus solely on electric cars to create a moderately diverse portfolio, let alone a mutual fund. You can invest in mutual funds that include EV stocks as part of an auto sector or clean energy play, for example, but theres just not enough for an EVonly fund at this point. At this point, perhaps the best you can do if you want an exclusively EV portfolio is add some exposure to the companies that are the biggest players in the market and review the market periodically to see if any additional investments could be made to improve your diversification. Look at EVonly car makers, battery makers, infrastructure providers, etc. to get a decent balance of stocks. I would not put any more than 10 of your entire investment portfolio into any one stock, and not more than 20 or so in this sector.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is an effective way to invest in electric car industry?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"How to calculate money needed for bills, by day","I think you might benefit from adopting a zerosum budget, in which you plan where each dollar will be spent ahead of time, rather than simply track spending or worry about the next expense. Heres a pretty good article on the subject How and Why to Use a ZeroSum Budget. This is the philosophy behind a popular budgeting tool You Need a Budget, I am not advocating the tool, but I am a fan of the idea that a budget is less about tracking spending and more about planning spending. That said, to answer your specific question, one method for tracking your minneeded for upcoming expenses would be to record the date, expense, amount due, and amount paid as shown here Then the formula to calculate the minneeded entered in E1 and copied down would be As you populate amounts paid, the MinNeeded is adjusted for all subsequent rows.

Why would a central bank or country not want their currency to appreciate against other currencies?,"I wrote about the dynamic of why either of a lower or higher exchange rate would be good for economies in Would dropping the value of its currency be good for an economy? A strong currency allows consumers to import goods cheaply from the rest of the world. A weak currency allows producers to export goods cheaply to the rest of the world. People are both consumers and producers. Clearly, there have to be tradeoffs. Strong or weak mean relative to Purchasing Power Parity i.e. you can buy more or less of an equivalent good with the same money. Governments worrying about unemployment will try and push their currencies weaker relative to others, no matter the cost.

Is there an advantage to keeping a liquid emergency fund if one also has an untapped line of credit?,"Why cant you have both? If you do have both credit and an emergency fund, and an emergency occurs, you can draw from the line of credit first. Having debt  cash is a much more stable situation than having neither, because then you have the option to use the cash to pay off the debt, or use the cash to pay other expenses.

Why would this FHA refinance cause my mortgage insurance payment to increase so much?,"The PMI premium you pay is dependent on a very large number of variables in the finance market. Mortgage insurance, at the higher interbank levels, is handled with credit default swaps the ones youve been hearing about on the news for the past 4 years, where the lender bundles a block of mortgages, takes them to a guarantor like AIG or Freddie Mac, and says ""We bet you that these mortgages will default this month, because the homeowners have little or no equity to deter them if we win, you agree to swap these debts for their current face value"". The lender examines the mortgages, calculates the odds of a default severe enough that the bank would come to collect, using complex environmental heuristics, multiplies by the value of the potential payout, adds a little for their trouble, and says ""well, well take that bet if you pay us X"". The bank takes the deal, then divvies up that cost among the mortgages and bills the homeowner for their share. The amount you pay for PMI can therefore depend on pretty much anything in this entire process the exact outstanding amount and equity status of your loan, the similar status of other mortgages your loan will be bundled with for assessment, who the guarantor is, what exact heuristic they use to come up with an amount, the weighting the bank uses to divvy it up, and how much they actually pass on to you. Most of these same variables are at play when you shop for actual insurance for your car or home, which is why your premiums will go up or down with the same insurer and why someone else always seems to have a better deal pretty much every insurer can say that ""drivers who switched saved an average of X"" of course they did, otherwise they wouldnt have switched. Thinking of it in those terms, its easy to see how this number can vary widely based on numbers you cant see. Youre free to say no, and it will cost you nothing right up until you sign something that says you agree to be penalized for saying no. While the overall amount of the payments does decrease, the PMI has gone up, and thats money youll never see again just like interest except you can deduct interest not PMI. I would do the tax math find out how much you could deduct over the next year in interest on your current loan, then on their proposed terms, and what the resulting tax bills will be from both. You may save monthly only to pay more than you saved to Uncle Sam at the end of the year. Youre also free to negotiate. The worst they can do is stay firm on their offer, but they may take a second look and say ""youre right, that PMI is rather high, well try again and see if we can do better"". They can either negotiate with their insurer, or they can eat some of the PMI cost that theyre currently passing on to you.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why would this FHA refinance cause my mortgage insurance payment to increase so much?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Will I be able to purchase land?,"If there is land for sale, you can buy it. The United States doesnt have many restrictions on the purchase of land. However, you need to be able to afford it.

Have a look around, there should be plenty of places for you to find land for sale. As for credit, it is more important that you dont build bad credit.

"Why do people use mortgages, when they could just pay for the house in full?","Condensed to the essence if you can reliably get more income from investing the cost of the house than the mortgage is costing you, this is the safest leveraged investment youll ever make. Theres some risk, of course, but there is risk in any financial decision. Taking the mortgage also leaves you with far greater flexibility than if you become ""house rich but cashpoor"". Note that you probably shouldnt be buying at all if you may need geographic flexibility in the next five years or so thats another part of the liquidity issue. Also, it doesnt have to be eitheror. I borrowed half and paid the rest in cash, though I could have taken either extreme, because that was the balance of certainty vs.risk that I was comfortable with. I also took a shorter mortgage than I might have, again trading off risk and return I decided I would rather have the house paid off at about the same time that I retire.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do people use mortgages, when they could just pay for the house in full?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

When should I walk away from my mortgage?,"Interestingly enough, ""strategic default"" seems to be more common than one might think in California and there is actually a lot of information available on it, to include a calculator that breaks down the numbers for you although affiliated with a law office. Speaking from a purely financial standpoint, walking away only makes sense if it puts you in a better financial position than you were before while you had the mortgage. If you look at the downsides of walking away The issues with the credit rating are will known but you need to take into account any open lines of credit you currently have as well as any need you might have to open a line of credit in the future. If you currently have credit cards, will the rates go up after the hit? On the housing side of things, you mortgage payment is currently a known quantity that will not change for the duration of the mortgage unless you do something to change it. However, it is fairly rare for rents to not change between years and if you want an apartment or house similar to what you currently have, you might find that the rent will fluctuate quite a bit between years and in the long run the rent might run higher than your current mortgage payment. Likewise, in the shorter term, if the landlord runs a credit check they might adjust what the rent is or deny you the apartment on the basis of the black mark on your history for reasons that other have mentioned. Another item to take into account is if you need to get a job in the future. Depending upon what you do for a living this might be a nonissue however, if you are in a position of trust, walking away from a mortgage payment will reflect negatively upon your character unless you have a very good reason for it. This can lead to a loss of employment opportunities. Next, if you walk away from the mortgage you are walking away from the current value of the home and any future value that the home might have. If you like where you are living and arent planning on moving to another part of the country, you are gambling that the market will not recover or that you would reach parity with what you owe by the time you need to sell the house. If you do plan on staying where you are and the house is in good repair, then in the long run you might be giving up quite a bit of money by walking away. These are a lot of factors to take into account though so its really hard to say one way or another if a strategic default is a good idea. In the long run you might come out ahead but knowing when that date is can be difficult to calculate. Likewise, in the long run it might adversely affect you and you might come to regret the decision. If the payments themselves are a bit too high, perhaps you can refinance or negotiate with the bank for a lower payment? If you get a better rate but keep your monthly payments the same then you might reach parity with the mortgage much faster which would also be to your advantage.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: When should I walk away from my mortgage?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

A University student wondering if investing in stocks is a good idea?,"Investing in the stock market early is a good thing. However, it does have a learning curve, and that curve can, and eventually will, cost you. One basic rule in investing is that risk and reward are proportional. The greater the reward, the higher the risk that you either a wont get the reward, or b lose your money instead. Given that, dont invest money you cant afford to lose you mentioned youre on a student budget. If you want to start with short but sercure investments, try finding a highinterest savings account or CD. For example, the bank I use has an offer where the first 500 in your account gets 6 interest  certainly not bad if you only put 500 in the account. Unfortunately, most banks are offering a pittance for savings rates or CDs. If youre willing to take more risk, you could certainly put money into the stock market. Before you do, I would recommend spending some time learning about how the stock market works, its flows and ebbs, and how stock valuations work. Dont buy a stock because you hear about it a lot understand why that stock is being valued as such. Also consider buying index funds such as SPY which is like a stock but tracks an entire index. That way if a specific company suddenly drops, you wont be nearly as affected. On the flip side, if only 1 company goes up, but the market goes down, youll miss out. But consider the odds of having picked that 1 company.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: A University student wondering if investing in stocks is a good idea?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

I just paid online with a debit card with no funds. What now?,"There are a few factors at play here. Depending on the bank that has offered you the card there are different types of overdraft protection that may have been set up. Typically, if they attempt to run the card with no money, if one of these is in play, you will be spared any overdraft fees by the transaction charging to a designated overdraft account, usually savings, or by the transaction failing due to insufficient funds. If you know the transaction went through, and you know there were not enough funds in the account to cover the transactions, then you have a few options. If you have overdraft protection that auto charges insufficient funds charges to a separate account, then you have nothing to worry about. If you do not, most banks offer a grace period where you have until the end of the day to zero out your account, that is to say pay the overdraft amount and bring your balance to at least 0. If this is a charge that occurred in the past, and you have already been charged an overdraft fee, there may still be hope. I cannot speak for all banks, but I know that Chase Bank offers a once per year overdraft forgiveness, where they will get rid of the charges if you agree to bring the account out of the negative.

Is Amazons offer of a 50 gift card a scam?,"The most likely reason for this card is that Amazon has an arrangement with the issuer I believe that that used to be Chase may have changed since. Such an arrangement may allow Amazon to take the risk of chargebacks, etc. in return for the issuer handling the mechanics of billing. This is advantageous for Amazon, as otherwise they are subject to both their own procedures and those of the issuer. Amazon would rather take the entire risk than share it with someone else who charges for the privilege. Fees for processing credit cards can be as much as 5, although 12 is more typical. Due to its size, Amazon may already have negotiated fees lower than 1. But even so, any savings they make are to their benefit. Further, now they can get a share of the fees charged to other merchants. For example, if you buy a book from Barnes  Noble an Amazon competitor with the Amazon card, then Amazon gets some money in return, say 1 of the transaction. If the price is the same on Amazon and at Barnes  Noble, you can actually save money with the Amazon card. Amazon gives more ""cash back"" in the form of gift card balance for an Amazon purchase. So the card may mean that you buy from Amazon when you might otherwise have chosen someone else. If we again assume a 20 margin, they only need 200 of additional purchases to make 40 of profit. Someone who buys 1000 additional on the Amazon site makes them 200 of profit. Theyre over 160 ahead. Also note that Amazon is only giving you a gift card, which you have to use on Amazon. And its difficult to spend exactly 50. As a practical matter, most people will buy, say, 60, with 10 of that money. So they sell you 48 of merchandise their cost, assuming a 20 margin for 10. They lost 38 on that transaction, but theyve lured you into a long term relationship that may return more than that. And they didnt lose the 50 you gained. They only lost 38. Think about it as a marketing cost. Amazon is willing to pay 38 for a long term relationship with you. From their perspective, doing so in such a way that you come out 50 ahead assuming you would have made the same purchases without this, is a winwin. Because once they have that relationship, they can leverage it to give them savings elsewhere. This is Amazons approach in general. Originally all their products were drop shipped from someone like Ingram Micro. They handled the web site and billing while the drop shipper handled inventory and shipping. Then Amazon added their own warehouses. Now they can do all that separately. This is just the same thing for buyers. Amazon manages all the risk of the transaction and thus gets all the profit. Because Amazon is managing the credit card risk, they have access to all the credit history. This helps them better determine if that sudden shipment of a 2000 camera to Thailand is a real transaction youre a photographer who regularly vacations in Thailand or a fake youve never been to Thailand in your life and your phone is camera enough. That additional information may itself be worth enough to make the relationship profitable for Amazon. Amazon certainly gets something out of the relationship. You give them money. And you are likely to give them more money with the Amazon card than they would otherwise receive. But you get products in return. Is that a good deal? If you prefer having the products to the money, then yes. Others have suggested that its the irresponsible credit card users that generate the real profit. I disagree. They generate more revenue in the short term, but then they overspend and declare bankruptcy. Then Amazon loses its money. Yes, they get more interest and fees in that case, but if they lose 1000, they needed to make 1000 in profit just to break even. Its safer to make the smaller short term profits with responsible customers who will continue to be customers for the long term. A steady profit of 100 or 200 a year is better than a one time profit of 500 followed by a loss of 1000 followed by nothing for ten years. Anyway, your question was if you should sign up for the card. If you are planning on doing a lot of shopping on Amazon, you might as well. It gives you cash back. If shopping on Amazon is inconvenient, then perhaps that outweighs the advantage of the card. The ""cash back"" is just Amazon money. You cant spend it anywhere but Amazon. If each transaction gives you a little bit of Amazon money, you have to keep going back to spend it.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is Amazons offer of a 50 gift card a scam?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Precedent and models for 100 equity available via initial offering?,"Founder makes available 100 equity, but uses a reasonable amount of the proceeds to pay himherself a salary or wage and from that salary invests in the same initial offering to acquire shares for himherself. I see several problems. What is a reasonable salary? Also, this leaves the door open to the following scam Founders say that they are going to follow this plan. However, instead of buying shares, they simply quit after being paid the salary. They use knowledge gained from this business to start a competitor. Investors are left holding an empty company. Tax consequences. The founder would pay income tax on the salary. By contrast, if the founder instead sells shares, that would be capital gains tax, which is lower in many countries e.g. the United States. Why would I want to invest in a business where the founders dont believe in it enough to take a significant equity stake? Consider the Amazon.com example. Jeff Bezos makes a minimal salary, around 80,000 a year, less than many of his employees. But he has a substantial ownership position. If the company doesnt make money, he wont. Would investors really value the stocks with a PE of 232.10 in 2016 if they didnt trust him to make the right long term decisions? Its also worth noting that most initial public offerings IPOs are not made when the founder is the only employee. A single employee company instead looks for private investors, often called angel investors. Companies generally dont go public until they are established in some way, often making money. Negotiating with angel investors is different from negotiating with the public. They can personally review the books and once invested tend to have input on how the money is spent. In other words, this is mostly solving the wrong problem if you talk about IPOs. This might make more sense with a crowdfunded venture, as that replaces a few angel investors with many individuals. But most crowdfunded ventures tend to approach things from the opposite direction. Instead of looking for investors, they look for customers. If they offer a useful product, they will get customers. If not, they never get the money. Beyond all this, if a founder is only going to get a fair salary some of the time, then why put in any sweat equity? This works fine if the company looks valuable after a year. What if it doesnt? The founder is out a year of sweat equity and has nothing in return. That happens now too, but the possibility of the big return offsets it. Youre taking out the big return. I dont think that this is good for either founders or investors. The founder trades a potentially good or even great return for a mediocre return. The investors trade a situation where both they and the founder benefit from a successful company to one where they benefit a lot more than the founder. Thats not good for either side.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Precedent and models for 100 equity available via initial offering?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why are banks providing credit scores for free?,"Why are banks all of a sudden providing people their credit scores for free? Because it is a really good idea.

How do I determine ownership split on a franchise model?,"There is no right and wrong answer to this question. What you and your business partner perceive as Fair is the best way to split the ownership of the new venture. First, regarding the two issues you have raised Capital Contributions The fact that you are contributing 90 of initial capital does not necessarily translate to 90 of equity. In my opinion, what is fair is that you transform your contributions into a loan for the company. The securitization of your contribution into a loan will make it easier to calculate your fair contribution and also compensate you for your risk by choosing whatever combination of interest income and equity you see suitable. For example, you might decide to split the company in half and consider your contributions a loan with 20, 50 or 200 annual interest. Salary It is common that cofounders of startups forgo their wages at the start of the company. I do not recommend that this forgone salary be compensated through equity because it is impossible to determine the suitable amount of equity to be paid. I suggest the translation of forgone wages into loans or preferred stocks in similar fashion to capital contribution Also, consider the following in deciding the best way to allocate equity between both of you and your partner Whose idea was it? Talk with you business partner how both of you value the inventor of the concept. In general, execution is more important but talking about how you both feel about it is good. Fulltime vs. parttime A person who works full time at the new venture should have more equity than the partner who is only a parttime helper. Control It is important to talk about control and decision making of the company. You can separate the control and decision making of important decisions from ownership.

Estate taxes and the top 1 percent by net worth,"Data is a funny thing. There are many different ways of constructing data sets. Keep in mind, the cite you linked is fine, I follow this kind of site when I am data mining. They got their data from the Government, and theres no reason to doubt its validity. Keep in mind, its a survey. They extrapolate from a survey of a small population  In the 2016 survey, 6,254 families were interviewed, and in the 2013 survey, 6,026 were interviewed. 1 Lets set that aside, and look at the numbers as if they were gospel. 10.37M net worth to be top 1. Thats people at all different ages, and not the wealth cutoff for those dying, else the estate tax would hit closer to the 1. Given the limited data set, Id only hypothesize, if we graphed the age along the bottom, X axis vs number of people, the curve would peek in mid to late 60s, as people retire. With 20 years for the couple to spend and gift, its not tough to imagine that by the time they pass away, the taxable estate 11M couple falls to just .2. 2 When the estate tax impacted estates over just 600K, and my daughter was born, we set up a trust. Out net worth was barely positive, but insurance alone would have created enough wealth to have our orphaned child be subject to the tax of our estate before she received a dime. We also used the trust to fund her college. As a completed gift, had we made some bad decisions and lost it all, at least that money would be protected. Keep in mind, there are different flavors of trusts, but its safe to say that in a survey to collect data, the million dollar trusts are considered family wealth. Not tough to imagine a good fraction of those families over 10M have a nice chunk already protected this way. 3 Last  For any illiquid assets, theres a discount that gets applied, typically 30.

An options trader in a bank would say that the value of a call option can go up for two reasons The VIX index is a measure of the levels of implied volatility, so you could intuitively say that when you trade options you are taking a view on two components the underlying stock, and the level of the VIX index. Importantly, as you get closer to the expiry date this second effect diminishes big jumps up in the VIX will produce smaller increases in the value of the call option. Taking this point to its limit, at maturity the value of the call option is only dependent on the price of the underlying stock. An options trader would say that the vega of a call option decreases as it gets closer to expiry. A consequence of this is that if pure options traders are naturally less inclined to buy and hold to expiry because otherwise they would really just be taking a view on the stock price rather than the stock price  the implied volatility surface. Trading options without thinking too much about implied volatities is of course a valid strategy  maybe you just use them because you will automatically have a mechanism which limits losses on your positions.

Are there special exceptions to the rule that US capital gains taxes are owed only when the gain materializes?,"This is really an extended comment on the last paragraph of BenMillers answer. When the manager of a mutual fund sells securities that the fund holds for a profit, or receives dividends stock dividends, bond interest, etc., the fund has the option of paying taxes on that money at corporate rates and distributing the rest to shareholders in the fund, or passing on the entire amount categorized as dividends, qualified dividends, net shortterm capital gains, and net longterm capital gains to the shareholders who then pay taxes on the money that they receive at their own respective tax rates. If the net gains are negative, i.e. losses, they are not passed on to the shareholders. See the last paragraph below. A shareholder doesnt have to reinvest the distribution amount into the mutual fund the option of receiving the money as cash always exists, as does the option of investing the distribution into a different mutual fund in the same family, e.g. invest the distributions from Vanguards SP 500 Index Fund into Vanguards Total Bond Index Fund andor vice versa. This last can be done without needing a brokerage account, but doing it across fund families will require the money to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account. Such crosstransfers can be helpful in reducing the amounts of money being transferred in rebalancing asset allocations as is recommended be done once or twice a year. Those investing in load funds instead of noload funds should keep in mind that several load funds waive the load for reinvestment of distributions but some funds dont the sales charge for the reinvestment is pure profit for the fund if the fund was purchased directly or passed on to the brokerage if the fund was purchased through a brokerage account. As Ben points out, a shareholder in a mutual fund must pay taxes in the appropriate categories on the distributions from the fund even though no actual cash has been received because the entire distribution has been reinvested. It is worth keeping in mind that when the mutual fund declares a distribution say 1.22 a share, the Net Asset Value per share drops by the same amount assuming no change in the prices of the securities that the fund holds and the new shares issued are at this lower price. That is, there is no change in the value of the investment if you had 10,000 in the fund the day before the distribution was declared, you still have 10,000 after the distribution is declared but you own more shares in the fund than you had previously. In actuality, the new shares appear in your account a couple of days later, not immediately when the distribution is declared. In short, a distribution from a mutual fund that is reinvested leads to no change in your net assets, but does increase your tax liability. Ditto for a distribution that is taken as cash or reinvested elsewhere. As a final remark, net capital losses inside a mutual fund are not distributed to shareholders but are retained within the fund to be written off against future capital gains.

Is inflation a good or bad thing? Why do governments want some inflation?,"Basically, in any financial system that features fractional reserve banking, the monetary supply expands during times of prosperity. Stable, low inflation of 24 keeps capital available while keeping the value of money stable. It also discourages hoarding of wealth. Banks arent vaults. They take deposits and make an explicit promise to repay the depositor on demand. Since most depositors dont need to withdraw money regularly, the lend out the money you deposited and maintain a reserve sufficient to meet daily cash needs. When times are good, banks lend to people and businesses who need capital, who in turn do things that add value to the overall economy. When times are bad, people and businesses either cannot get capital or pay more for it, which reduces the number of times that money changes hands and has a negative impact on the wider economy. People who are trying to sell you commodities or who have a naive view of how the economy actually works decry the current monetary system and throw around scary words like ""fiat currency"" and ""inflation is theft"". What these people dont realize is that before the present system, where the value of money is based on promises to repay, the gold and silver backed systems also experienced inflation.

What is the preferred way to set up personal finances?,"Theres a lot of personal preference and personal circumstance that goes into these decisions. I think that for a person starting out, whats below is a good system. People with greater needs probably arent reading this question looking for an answer.

You should probably have one checking account and one savings  money market account. If youre total savings are too low to avoid fees on two accounts, then just the checking account at the beginning. Keep the checking account balance high enough to cover your actual debits plus a little buffer. Put the rest in savings. Multiple bank accounts beyond the basics or using multiple banks can be appropriate for some people in some circumstances.

Why cant you just have someone invest for you and split the profits and losses with him?,"For one thing fund managers, even fund management companies, own less money than their clients put together. On the whole they simply cannot underwrite 50 of the potential losses of the funds they manage, and an offer to do so would be completely unsecured. Warren Buffet owns about 13 of Berkshire Hathaway, so I suppose maybe he could do it if he wanted to, and I wont guess why he prefers his own business model investing in the fund he manages, or used to manage over the one you propose for him keeping his money in something so secure he could use it to cover arbitrary losses on BH. Buffett and his investors have always felt that he has sufficient incentive to see BH do well, and its not clear that your scheme would provide him any useful further incentive. You say that the details are immaterial. Supposing instead of 50 it was 0.0001, one part in a million. Then it would be completely plausible for a fund manager to offer this ""invest 50 million, lose it all, and Ill buy dinner to apologise"". But would you be as attracted to it as you would be to 50? Then the details are material. Actually a fund manager could do it by taking your money, putting 50 into the fund and 50 into a cash account. If you make money on the fund, you only make half as much as if youd been fully invested, so half your profit has been ""taken"" when you get back the fund value  cash. If you lose money on the fund, pay you back 50 of your losses using the cash. Worst case scenario[], the fund is completely wiped out but you still get back 50 of your initial investment. The combined fundcash investment vehicle has covered exactly half your losses and it subtracts exactly half your profit. The manager has offered the terms you asked for 50 leverage but still doesnt have skin the game. Your proposed terms do not provide the incentive you expect. Why dont fund managers offer this? Because with a few exceptions 50 is an absurd amount for an investment fund to keep in cash, and nobody would buy it. If you want to use cash for that level of inverse leverage you call the bank, open an account, and keep the interest for yourself. You dont expect your managed fund to do it. Furthermore, supposing the manager did invest 100 of your subscription in the fund and cover the risk with their own capital, that means the only place they actually make any profit is the return on a risk that they take with their capital on the funds winslosses. Youve given them no incentive to invest your money as well as their own they might as well just put their capital in the fund and let you keep your money. Theyre better off without you since theres less paperwork, and they can invest whatever they like instead of carefully matching whatever money you send them. If you think they can make better picks than you, and you want them to do so on your behalf, then you need to pay them for the privilege. Riding their coattails for free is not a service they have any reason to offer you. It turns out that you cannot force someone to expose themselves to a particular risk other than by agreeing that they will expose themselves to that risk and then closely monitoring their investment portfolio. Otherwise they can find ways to insurehedge the risk theyre required to take on. If its on their books but cancelled by something else then they arent really exposed. So to provide incentive what we normally want is what Buffett does, which is for the fund manager to be invested in the fund to keep them keen, and to draw a salary in return for letting you in[]. Their investment cannot precisely match yours because the fund managers capital doesnt precisely match your capital. It doesnt cover your losses because its in the same fund, so if your money vanishes the fund manager loses too and has nothing to cover you with. But it does provide the incentive. [] All right, I admit it, worst case scenario theres a total banking collapse, end of civilization as we know it, and the cash account defaults. But then even in your proposed scheme its possible that whatever assets the fund manager was using as security could fail to materialise. [] So why, you might ask, do individual fund managers get bonuses in return for meeting fixed targets instead of only being partpaid in shares in their own fund whose value they can then maximise? I honestly dont know, but I suspect ""lots of reasons"". Probably the psychology of rewarding them for performance in a way that compares with other executive posts or professions they might take up instead of fund management. Probably the benefit to the fund itself, which wants to attract more clients, of beating certain benchmarks.

Does a US LLC owned by a nonresident alien have to pay US taxes if it operates exclusively online?,"Since as you say, an LLC is a passthrough entity, you will be making income in the U.S. when you sell to U.S. customers. And so you will need to file the appropriate personal tax forms in the US. As well as potentially in one or more States. The US government does not register LLCs. The various States do. So youll be dealing with Oregon, Wisconsin, Wyoming, one of those for the LLC registration. You will also need to have a registered agent in the State. That is a big deal since the entire point of forming an LLC is to add a liability shield. You would lose the liability shield by not maintaining the business formalities. Generally nations aim to tax income made in their nation, and many decline to tax income that youve already paid taxes on in another nation. A key exception If money is taxed by the U.S. it may also be taxed by one of the States. Two States wont tax the same dollar. Registering an LLC in one State does not mean youll pay state taxes there. Generally States tax income made in their State. Its common to have a Wyoming LLC that never pays a penny of tax in Wyoming. Officially, an LLC doing business in a State it did not form in, must register in that State as a ""foreign LLC"" even though its still in the USA. The fee is usually the same as for a domestic LLC. ""Doing business"" means something more than incidental sales, it means having a presence specifically in the State somehow. It gets complicated quick.

"Pensions, annuities, and retirement","Pension in this instance seems to mean pension income as opposed to pension pot. This money would be determined by whatever assets are being invested in. It may be fixed, it may be variable. Completely dependant on the underlying investments. An annuity is a product. In simple terms, you hnd over a lump sum of cash and receive an agreed annual income until you die. The underlying investment required to reach that income level is not your concern, its the providers worry. So there is a hige mount of security to the retiree in having an annuity. The downside of annuities is that the level of income may be too low for your liking. For instance, 40010,000 would mean 400 for every 10,000 given to the provider. Thats 4 and would take 25 years to break even ignoring inflation, opportunity cost of investing yourself. Therefore, the gamble is whether you outlive the deal. You could hand over 50,000 to a provider and drop dead a year later. Your 50k got you, say, 2k and then you popped your clogs. Provider wins. Or you could like 40 years after retiring and then you end up costing the provider 80k. You win. Best way to think of an annuity is a route to guaranteed, agreed income. To secure that guarantee, theres a price to pay  and that is, a lower income rate than you might like. Hope that was the kind of reply you were hoping for. If not, edit your OP and ask again. Chris.

When does Ontarios HST come into effect?,"It looks like the HST will be in effect in Ontario on July 1st, 2010. As to whether it will replace GST with HST for all services, it looks like some sectors may get special treatment Ontario may exempt mutual funds from HST National Post. But it doesnt look final yet. However, I would suggest that most servicebased businesses in Ontario need to prepare to start charging 13 HST instead of 5 GST. It will be the law.

What happens to an options contract during an all stock acquisition?,"According to this article With an allstock merger, the number of shares covered by a call option is changed to adjust for the value of the buyout. The options on the boughtout company will change to options on the buyer stock at the same strike price, but for a different number of shares. Normally, one option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock. For example, company A buys company B, exchanging 12 share of A for each share of B. Options purchased on company B stock would change to options on company A, with 50 shares of stock delivered if the option is exercised. This outcome strongly suggests that, in general, holders of options should cash out once the takeover is announced, before the transactions takes place. Since the acquiring company will typically offer a significant premium, this will offer an opportunity for instant profits for call option holders while at the same time being a big negative for put option holders. However, it is possible in some cases where the nominal price of the two companies favours the SML company ie. the share prices of SML is lower than that of BIG, the holder of a call option may wish to hold onto their options.

The bond is guaranteed to be worth a certain amount at maturity as long as the issuer hasnt defaulted, but before maturity the market price of the bond will fluctuate, primarily based on interest rate movements.

Foreign national currently working in U.S.  investing in 401k plan How will taxes apply?,"The 401k contribution is Federal tax free, when you make the contribution, and most likely State too. I believe that is true for California, specifically. There was a court case some years ago about people making 401k or IRA contributions in New York, avoiding the New York state income tax. Then they moved to Florida no income tax, and took the money out. New York sued, saying they had to pay the New York income tax that had been deferred, but the court said no. So you should be able to avoid California state income tax, and then later if you were to move to, for example, Texas no income tax, have no state income tax liability. At the Federal level, you will have different problems. You wont have the money it will be held by the 401k trustee. When you try to access the money cash the account out, you will have to pay the deferred taxes. Effectively, when you remove the money it becomes income in the year it is removed. You can take the money out at any time, but if you are less than 59 12 at the time that you take it, there is a 10 penalty. The agreement is that the Feds let you defer paying the tax because it is going to finance your retirement, and they will tax it later. If you take it out before 59 12, they figure you are not retired yet, and are breaking your part of the agreement. Of course you can generally leave the money in the 401k plan with your old employer and let it grow until you are 59.5, or roll it over into another 401k with a new employer if they let you, or into an IRA. But if you have returned to your own country, having an account in the U.S. would introduce both investment risk and currency risk. If you are in another country when you want the money, the question would be where your U.S. residence would be. If you live in California, then go to, say France, your U.S. residence would still be California, and you would still owe California income tax. If you move from California to Texas and then to France, your U.S. residence would be Texas. This is pretty vague, as you might have heard in the Rahm Emanual case  was he a resident of Chicago or Washington, D.C.? Same problem with Howard Hughes who was born in Texas, but then spent most his life in California, then to Nevada, then to Nicaragua, and the Bahamas. When he died Texas, California and Nevada all claimed him as a resident, for estate taxes. The important thing is to be able to make a reasonable case that you are a resident of where ever you want to be  drivers license, mailing address, living quarters, and so on.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Online transaction  Money taken out late,"Debit Cards have a certain processing delay, ""lag time"", before the transaction from the vendor completes with your bank. In the US its typically 3 business days but I have seen even a 15 day lag from Panera Bread. I guess in the UK, payment processors have similar processing delays. A business is not obliged to run its payment processing in realtime, as thats very expensive. Whatever be the lag time, your bank is supposed to cover the payment you promised through your card. Now if you dont have agreements in place for example, overdraft with your bank, they will likely have to turn down payments that exceed your available balance.

Is 0 credit card utilization worse than 120 credit card utilization for any reason other than pure statistics?,"I too was very confused when I tried to be tricky and paid down my balance BEFORE the bill date. I thought this would be a great thing because it would show my utilization near zero percent. The opposite happen, it dropped my credit score from 762 to 708. Here is the best example I can come up with when it comes to utilization. Lets pretend you are an insurance company and you trying to figure out who are the best risk drivers. The people that drive 10 of the day are a better risk than the people that drive 50 of the day. The people that drive 50 of the day are a better risk than the people that drive 90 of the day. Here is the rub when people drive 0. When you look at the people at 0 they appear to be walking, busing or flying. What they are NOT doing is driving. Since they are not driving using Credit they are viewed as POOR drivers since they are not keeping up on their driving skills. Paying bills, watching how they spend, and managing their debt. So, now before the billing date I pay down my balance to something between 5 to 10 of my utilization. After the bill is issued, I pay it off in FULL.  I am not going to PAY these crazy interest rates. What shows up on my credit report is a person that is driving his credit between 5 and 10 utilization. It shows I know I how to manage my revolving accounts. I know its dumb, you would think they reward people that have zero debt, I dont hate banks I hate the game.

How to rebalance a portfolio without moving money into losing investments,"Also, almost by definition rebalancing involves making more trades than you would have otherwise wouldnt the additional trading fees you incurred in doing so reduce the benefits of this strategy? You forgot to mention taxes. Rebalancing does or rather can incur costs. One way to minimize the costs is to use the parts of the portfolio that have essentially zero cost of moving. These generally are the funds in your retirement accounts. In the United States they can be in IRAs or 401Ks they can be regular or Roth. Selling winners withing the structure of the plan doesnt trigger capital gains taxes, and many have funds within them that have zero loads. Another way to reduce trading fees is to only rebalance once a year or once every two years or by setting a limit on how far out of balance. For example dont rebalance at 6139 to get back to 6040 even if it has been two years. Given that the ratio of investments is often rather arbitrary to begin with, how do I know whether Im selling high and buying low or just obstinately sticking with a losing asset ratio? The ratio used in an example or in an article may be arbitrary, but your desired ratio isnt arbitrary. You selected the ratio of your investments based on several criteria your age, your time horizon, your goals for the money, how comfortable you are with risk. As these change during your investing career those ratios would also morph. But they arent arbitrary. These decisions to rebalance are separate from the ones to sell a particular investment. You could sell Computer Company X because of how it is performing, and buy stock in Technology Company Y because you think it has a better chance of growing. That transaction would not be a rebalancing. Selling part of your stock in Domestic Company A to buy stock in international Company B would be part of a rebalancing.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How to rebalance a portfolio without moving money into losing investments?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Any kind of exit load is going to make an asset less liquid due to the penalties associated with making the sale. So, the whole point of liquid funds is to give people the option of selling quickly if they need to. Since an exit load is meant to discourage this behavior, liquid funds tend not to have one. The point isnt what the financial institution gets, its about offering a service to clients with a particular investment need.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Unable to understand logic behind why there is no exit load on liquid fund?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What would I miss out on by self insuring my car?,"You lose your agent services. When my wife wrecked our car 3 years ago our agent took care of everything. He got us a rental car, made the arrangements to get it fixed, checked in to see how we were doing, and even helped us set up a second opinion on my wifes wrist surgery. The accident was ruled the fault of the uninsured driver who decided to take off through the red light. But our insurance was the one that covered it all total expenses over 80k. We would have had to eat most of those with out full coverage. Most everything was set up our rental car, estimates on repair, even her inital consutation with the surgeon before the investigator had filed her report. Our agents first question was is everyone ok. His second was what can i do to help? He never asked us what happened and was always ahead of our needs in dealing with it. If these things are not important to you, you can probably save quite a bit of money self insuring. But if you are in an accident and unable to do them yourself, do you have someone to do it for you? Do you trust them to handle your business and are you willing to saddle them with the responsibility of dealing with it? To me insurance is less about me and more about my family. It was nice that my agent did all of that for me. I would have been willing to do it myself though.

Can a trade happen in between the bid and ask price?,"Re A trader when buying needs to buy at the ask price and when selling needs to sell at the bid price. So how can a trade happen in between the bid and ask? Saying the trade can happen ""in between"" the bid  ask is simplistic. There is a time dimension to the market. Its more accurate to say that an order can be placed ""in between"" the current best bid  ask observed at time T0, thus establishing a new level for one or the other of those quoted prices observed at time T0. If you enter a market order to buy or sell, then yes, youll generally be accepting the current best ask or best bid with your order, because thats what a market order says to do Accept the current best market price being offered for your kind of transaction. Of course, prices may move much faster than your observation of the price and the time it takes to process your order  youre far from being the only participant. Market orders aside, you are free to name your own price above or below the current best bid  ask, respectively. ... then one could say that you are placing an order ""in between"" the bid and ask at the time your order is placed. However  and this is key  you are also moving one or the other of those quoted prices in the process of placing your abovebid buy order or your belowask sell order. Then, only if somebody else in the market chooses to accept your new ask or bid does your intended transaction take place. And that transaction takes place at the new ask or bid price, not the old one that was current when you entered your order. Read more about bid  ask prices at this other question p.s. FWIW, I dont necessarily agree with the assertion from the article you quoted, i.e. ""By looking for trades that take place in between the bid and ask, you can tell when a strong trend is about to come to an end.""

Please see the example on page 48. and on page 48 How do I separate back out gross receipts tax from total gross receipts? See the following examples of how to separate the gross receipts tax 1 To separate back out tax from total receipts at the end of the report period, first subtract deductible and exempt receipts, and then divide total receipts including the tax for the report period by one plus the applicable gross receipts tax rate. For example, if your tax rate is 5.5 and your total receipts including tax are 1,055.00 with no deductions or exemptions, divide 1,055.00 by 1.055. The result is your gross receipts excluding tax to enter in Column D of the CRS1 Form or 1,000. 2 If your tax rate is 5.5, and your total gross receipts including tax are 1,055.00, and included in that figure are 60 in deductions and another 45 in exemptions a Subtract 105 the sum of your deductions and exemptions from 1,055.

Does the profit of a company directly affect its stock or indirectly by causing people to buy or sell?,"Yes, the price of a stock is what investors think the value of a stock is, which is not tied to profits or dividends by any rigid formula. But to say that therefore the price could be high even though the company is doing very poorly is hypothetically true, but unlikely in practice. Consider any other product. There is no fixed formula for the value of a used car, either. If everyone agreed that a rusting, 20year old car that doesnt run is worth 100,000, then thats what it would sell for. But thats a pretty big ""if"" at the beginning of that sentence. If the car had been used in some hit TV show 20 years ago, or if it was owned by a celebrity, or some such special case, maybe a rusting old car really would sell for 100,000. Likewise, a stock might have a price higher than what one would predict from its dividends if some rich person wanted to buy that company because the brand name brings back nostalgic memories from his youth and so he drives the price up, etc. But the normal case is that, in the long term, the price of a stock tends to settle on a value proportional to the dividends that it pays. Or rather, and this is a big caveat, the dividends that investors expect it to pay in the future. And then adjusted for all sorts of other factors and special situations, like the value of the company if it was to be liquidated, etc.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Does the profit of a company directly affect its stock or indirectly by causing people to buy or sell?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?,"The breakdown between how much of your payment is going toward principal and interest is very important. The principal balance remaining on your loan is the payoff amount. Once the principal is paid off, your loan is finished. Each month, some of your payment goes to pay off the principal, and some goes to pay interest profit for the bank. Using your example image, lets say that youve just taken out a 300k mortgage at 5 interest for 30 years. You can click here to see the amortization schedule on that loan. The monthly payment is 1610.46. On your first payment, only 360 went to pay off your principal. The rest 1250 went to interest. That money is lost. If you were to pay off your 300k mortgage after making one payment, it would cost you 299,640, even though you had just made a payment of 1250. Interest accrues on the principal balance, so as time goes on and more of the principal has been paid, the interest payment is less, meaning that more of your monthly payment can go toward the principal. 15 years into your 30year mortgage, your monthly payment is paying 762 of your principal, and only 849 is going toward interest. Your principal balance at that time would be about 203k. Even though you are halfway done with your mortgage in terms of time, youve only paid off about a third of your house. Toward the end of your mortgage, when your principal balance is very low, almost all of your payment goes toward principal. In the last year, only 513 of your payments goes toward interest for the whole year. You can think of your monthly loan payment as a minimum payment. If you continue to make the regular monthly payments, your mortgage will be paid off in 30 years. However, if you pay more than that, your mortgage will be paid off much sooner. The extra that you pay above your regular monthly payment all goes toward principal. Even if you have no plans to pay your mortgage ahead of schedule, there are other situations where the principal balance matters. The principal balance of your mortgage affects the amount of equity that you have in your home, which is important if you sell the house. If you decide to refinance your mortgage, the principal balance is the amount that will need to be paid off by the new loan to close the old loan.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What do people mean when they talk about the central bank providing cheap money? What are the implications for the stock market?,"Newspapers write a lot about the central bank stopping ""cheap money"" in the US. What is that exactly and what are the implications for the stock market? An interest rate is simply defined as the price of money. So if money is cheap, it must mean there is a low interest rate compared to normal. If milk is cheap, were comparing it to past prices or prices at competitors stores. Same with money. I dont think its fair to say just because the supply of dollars rises that the value of dollars will go down. Value or price is determined by supply and demand, not just supply. Its possible for the demand for dollars to be stronger than the rising supply, which would drive the price higher. A good example of this is to look at the value of the dollar recently. The Fed has been printing 85 billion per month, yet the value of them is going up compared to foreign currencies, gold, and just about everything. Why? Because the Fed has merely threatened to stop, but it hasnt stopped. That alone was enough to increase demand above supply. So if you want to know what will happen, take a look at what IS happening. When cheap money ends, the value of the dollar will go up, interest rates will go up. This will be a drag on the economy. It will be more difficult for companies to show profits and earnings should decline. In addition, those who have grown accustom to the easy money and have overleveraged themselves ie REITs could go bankrupt.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What do people mean when they talk about the central bank providing cheap money?

Why do employers require you to spread your 401k contributions throughout the year to get the maximum match?,"Theres no such requirement in general.

Are there any rules against penalizing consumers for requesting accurate credit reporting?,"To answer the heart of your question, it would be illegal for any credit bureau or creditor to somehow ""penalize"" you just for trying to make sure that whats being reported about you is accurate. Thats why the Fair Credit Reporting Act exists  thats where the rights and mechanisms come from for letting you learn about and request accurate reporting of your credit history. Every creditor is responsible for reporting its own data to the bureaus, using the format provided by those bureaus for doing so. A creditor may not provide all of the information that can be reported, and it may not report information in as timely a manner as it could or should e.g., payments made may not show up for weeks or even months after they were made, etc.. The bottom line is that the credit bureaus are not arbiters of the data they report. They simply report. They dont draw conclusions, they dont make decisions on what data to report. If a creditor provides data that is within the parameters of what the bureaus ask to be provided, then the bureaus report precisely that  nothing more, nothing less. If there is an inaccuracy or mistake on your report, it is the fault and responsibility of the creditor, and it is therefore up to the creditor to correct it once it has been brought to their attention. Federal laws spell out the process that the bureau has to comply with when you file a dispute, and there are strict standards requiring the creditor to promptly verify valid information or remove anything which is not correct. The credit bureaus are simply automated clearinghouses for the information provided by the creditors who choose to subscribe to each bureaus system. A creditor can choose which or none of the bureaus they wish to report to, which is why some accounts show on one bureaus report on you but not anothers. What I caution is, just because a credit bureaus reports on your credit doesnt mean they have anything to do with the accuracy or detail of what is being reported. Thats up to the creditors.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are there any rules against penalizing consumers for requesting accurate credit reporting?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Debt collector has wrong person and is contacting my employer,"From a page on consumerfinance.gov A debt collector generally may not contact your employer or other thirdparties about the debt. Debt collectors may ask your employer to verify your employment, or ask for your address or telephone number. Note  they arent even allowed to tell the employer that they are trying to collect a debt. So  even if you were the guilty party, this isnt allowed. Theyve already broken very clear laws and thus are probably not trustworthy, so echoing what others have said dont give them your own personal information. If theyve done one days research on the law governing their industry they know this is illegal. If theyve actually gotten any money from your employer, its theft. If they havent then its just attempted theft. Contact the police regardless. Also  contact a lawyer. You may well have the right to sue them. Theyve broken Federal laws in a way that causes you injury. Odds are theyve broken state laws as well. One last point  do you even have proof that these are debt collectors collecting a real debt, rather than people trying to get you to give them your SSN?

"Why invest for the longterm rather than buy and sell for quick, big gains?","As an easy way to answer... look at an index, lets say the SP 500. Look at the price this last October, and predict where it will move in November... easy right? It already happened, and you have the benefit of hindsight. The move looks like such a consistent, obvious continuation of the previous up and down pattern. It looks predictable, like you could have guessed that. Now, look at todays price, and predict where it will go next month. Not so easy now? The problem is, every point youre at, all the time, looks like a possible inflection point or turning point. If youre following an uptrend, you may think itll continue, but you may also think that it zigged so far up already, that now its ready for a zag down where youll buy. So you wait... and it keeps rising, and you kick yourself for missing out. Next time, you see another uptrend and resolve to buy it regardless, thinking now itll keep going, but it turns down the second you buy it, and keeps dropping. You kick yourself again. The market is amazing at doing this to you every time. In real time, every wiggle in the price looks simultaneously like a trend that could continue, and like a trend that has moved far enough and is ready to reverse. And more likely youll guess the wrong one. The ONLY way with some little hope of succeeding is to study study study, and find and learn trading rules with just over 5050 chances like buying when a moving average is touched within an uptrend as an example, and setting a stop loss at 1, and a sell limit at 2 or something, and then never ever deviate from that strategy, because your only hope is in the consistency of statistics and odds over time. Youll get many 1 losses, and hopefully enough 2 gains to compensate the losses, plus some profit.

How much does it cost to build a subdivision of houses on a large plot of land?,"The estimated cost of 200 sqft of living space is achievable by builders who are following one the their standard plans. They build hundreds of homes each year across the region using those standard plans. They have detailed schedules for constructing those homes, and they know exactly how many 2x4s are need to build house X with options A, F, and P. They buy hundreds of dishwashers and get discounts. That price also includes the cost of the raw land and the required improvements of the property. You need to know the zoning for that land. You need to know what you can build by right, and what you can get exceptions for. You dont want to pay 600 K and then find out you can only build a 1 level house and you can only use 14 acre. You would need to start with a design and then have the architect and the builder and a real estate lawyer look over the property. Then they can give you an estimate of what it would cost to put that design on that property. 83k sqft? I mean it can accommodate at least 10 houses. It depends on what is the minimum lot size. If the maximum allowable density is three houses per acre you can get 6 in 2.2 acres, but if the minimum lot size is supposed to be 5 acres, then you will need an exception just to build one house.

Whats the catch in investing in real estate for rent?,"It is easier to get a loan on a rental than a flip, which is a huge advantage to rental properties. Leverage allows you to increase your returns and make more money off appreciation and higher rents. I use ARMs to finance my rental properties that are amortized over 30 years. I have to put 20 percent down, but my portfolio lender lets me get as many loans as I want. Because I put 20 percent down on my rental properties and they still have great cash flow I can buy three times as many properties as I could with cash purchases.

"If early exercise is a bad idea, why American option is more expensive than European [duplicate]","There are a few situations in which it may be advantageous to exercise early. Wikipedia actually has a good explanation Option Style, Difference in value To account for the Americans higher value there must be some situations in which it is optimal to exercise the American option before the expiration date. This can arise in several ways, such as An in the money ITM call option on a stock is often exercised just before the stock pays a dividend that would lower its value by more than the options remaining time value. A put option will usually be exercised early if the underlying asset files for bankruptcy.[3] A deep ITM currency option FX option where the strike currency has a lower interest rate than the currency to be received will often be exercised early because the time value sacrificed is less valuable than the expected depreciation of the received currency against the strike. An American bond option on the dirty price of a bond such as some convertible bonds may be exercised immediately if ITM and a coupon is due. A put option on gold will be exercised early when deep ITM, because gold tends to hold its value whereas the currency used as the strike is often expected to lose value through inflation if the holder waits until final maturity to exercise the option they will almost certainly exercise a contract deep ITM, minimizing its time value.[citation needed]","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If early exercise is a bad idea, why American option is more expensive than European [duplicate]?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Having something thats at least a bit countermarket can be helpful for balancing so something that will be going up some when the market overall is down some I wouldnt necessarily do bonds at your age, but international markets are good for that, or a stock ETF thats more stable than the overall market. If youre using Vanguard, look at the minimums for buying Admiral shares usually a few grand and aim to get those if possible, as they have significantly lower fees  though VOO seems to pretty much tie the admiral version VFIAX so in that case it may not matter so much.

Whats the difference between buying bonds and buying bond funds for the longterm?,"A bond fund will typically own a range of bonds of various durations, in your specific fund The fund holds highquality longterm New York municipal bonds with an average duration of approximately 610 years So through this fund you get to own a range of bonds and the fund price will behave similar to you owning the bonds directly. The fund gives you a little diversification in terms of durations and typically a bit more liquidity. It also may continuously buy bonds over time so you get some averaging vs. just buying a bond at a given time and holding it to maturity. This last bit is important, over long durations the bond fund may perform quite differently than owning a bond to maturity due to this ongoing refresh. Another thing to remember is that youre paying management fees for the funds management. As with any bond investment, the longer the duration the more sensitive the price is to change in interest rates because when interest rates change the price will track it. i.e. compare a change of 1 for a one year duration vs. 1 yearly over 10 years If Im correct, why would anyone in the U.S. buy a longterm bond fund in a market like this one, where interest rates are practically bottomed out? That is the multitrillion dollar question. Bond prices today reflect what ""people"" are willing to pay for them. Those ""people"" include the Federal Reserve which through various programs QE, Operate Twist etc. has been forcing the interest rates to where they want to see them. If no one believed the Fed would be able to keep interest rates where they want them then the prices would be different but given that investors know the Fed has access to an infinite supply of money it becomes a more difficult decision to bet against that. aka ""Dont fight the Fed"". My personal belief is that rates will come up but I havent been able to translate that belief into making money  This question is very complex and has to do not only with US policies and economy but with the status of the US currency in the world and the world economy in general.

Id also like to address some of the indirect assumptions that were made in your bullet points. Im convinced that the best way to overcome this is not simply to hold down a good job with COLAs every year, max out your IRA accounts and 401ks, invest another 1020 on top, and live off of the savings and whatever Social Security decides to pay you. Instead, the trick is to not retire  to make a transition into an incomeproducing activity that can be done in the typical retirement years, hopefully one that is closer to ones calling i.e., more fulfilling. This takes time, not money.

Would it make sense to take a loan from a relative to pay off student loans?,"I struggle to see the value to this risk from the standpoint of your motherinlaw. This is not a small amount of money for a single person to lend to a single person ignoring your personal relationship. Right now, using a blended rate of about 8 and a 5 year payment period, your cost on that 50,000 is somewhere in the neighborhood of 11,000 with a monthly payment around 1,014. Using the same monthly payment but paying your MIL at 5 youll complete the loan about 3.5 months sooner and save about 5,000, she will make about 6,000 in interest over 5 years against a 50,000 outlay. Alternatively, you can just prioritize payments to the more expensive loans. Its difficult to work out a total cost comparison without your expected payoff timelines and amounts youre currently paying toward all the loans. Im sure a couple hours with a couple of spreadsheets could yield a plan that would net you a savings substantially close to the 5,000 youd save by risking your mother in laws money. A lot of people think personal lending risk is about the relationship between the people involved, but theres more to it than that. Its not about you and your wife separating, its not about the awkward dinner and conversations if you lose your job. Something might physically happen to you, you could become disabled or die. Right now, thats an extremely diversified and calculated risk taken by a gigantic lender. Unless your mother in law is very wealthy, this is not nearly enough reward to assume this sort of risk in my opinion. Her risk FAR outpaces your potential five year savings. IF you wanted to pursue this as a means of paying interest to a family member rather than the bank, Id only borrow an amount I budgeted and intended to pay within this single year.

How can I live outside of the rat race of American life with 300k?,"So my read on the question is ""How do I invest 300k such that it earns me a living wage without the ongoing grind inherent in most formal employment?"" Reading the other answers to date it looks like most of them are thinking in terms of investment accounts and trying to live off of the earnings from such. I wanted to throw out a couple of alternative choices that may be worth considering... The first is realestate investing. 300k should allow you to pick up 2 or 3 single family dwellings with little or no mortgage. Turning them into rentals placed with a good property management company should easily pay their expenses and provide a consistent income with minimal effortattention from you. Similar story with buying into multifamily housing or commercial realestate. Your key concern here is picking the right market in which to buy and finding a reputable manager to handle the day to day issues on your behalf. Note that you are not overly concerned with the potential resale value of the propertys, but the probable rental income they can generate, these are separate concerns that may not align with each other. Second is buyingfounding a business that has a general manager other than yourself. Franchise ownership may be a potential option for you under the circumstances. The key concern here is picking the business, location, and manager that make you comfortable in terms of the risk involved. You need the place to make enough money to pay for itself and the salary of everyone working there, with enough left over for you to live on. Sounds easy enough, but not so much in practice. Generally you can expect at least a few years of being hands on and watching things very closely to make sure it is going the way you want it to. Finding a mentor who has done this type of transition before to walk you through it would be strongly advised.

Should I pay more than 20 down on a home?,"Leverage increase returns, but also risks, ie, the least you can pay, the greater the opportunity to profit, but also the greater the chance you will be underwater. Leverage is given by the value of your asset the house over the equity you put down. So, for example, if the house is worth 100k and you put down 20k, then the leverage is 5 another way to look at it is to see that the leverage is the inverse of the margin  or percentage down payment  so 10.20  5. The return on your investment will be magnified by the amount of your leverage. Suppose the value of your house goes up by 10. Had you paid your house in full, your return would be 10, or 10k100k. However, if you had borrowed 80 dollars and your leverage was 5, as above, a 10 increase in the value of your house means you made a profit of 10k on a 20k investment, a return of 50, or 10k20k100. As I said, your return was magnified by the amount of your leverage, that is, 10 return on the asset times your leverage of 5  50. This is because all the profit of the house price appreciation goes to you, as the value of your debt does not depend on the value of the house. What you borrowed from the bank remains the same, regardless of whether the price of the house changed. The problem is that the amplification mechanism also works in reverse. If the price of the house falls by 10, it means now you only have 10k equity. If the price falls enough your equity is wiped out and you are underwater, giving you an incentive to default on your loan. In summary, borrowing tends to be a really good deal heads you win, tails the bank loses or as happened in the US, the taxpayer loses.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Should I pay more than 20 down on a home?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Most common types of financial scams an individual investor should beware of?,"Anything where the initial step of someone trying to get you into anything financial is to send you an email. There are valid situations in which emails may be used to introduce you to a financial product or offer, such as if you have signed up for an electronic newsletter that includes such information. But in that particular case, the email isnt the first step rather, whatever caused you to sign up for the newsletter was. Even in a valid, legitimate scenario, you should obviously still perform due diligence and research the offer before committing any of your money. But the odds that someone is contacting you out of the blue via email with a legitimate financial offer are tiny. The odds that a lawyer, a banker or someone similar in a remote country would initially contact you via email are yet smaller Id call those odds infinitesimal. Nonzero, but unlikely enough that it is probably more likely that you would win the grand prize in the state lottery four times in a row. Keep in mind that responding in any way to spam emails will simply confirm to the sender that your email address is valid and is being read. That is likely to cause you to receive more spam, not less, no matter the content of your response. Hence, it is better to flag the email as spam or junk if your email provider offers that feature, or just delete it if they dont.

If a stock last traded for 10, someone can put out an offer to buy the stock at 9.50, if they find someone who wants to sell and will accept that price, then a deal is made. unless something is falling rapidly in price however, an offer that far below the last price is not terribly likely to be accepted.

What exactly is the interest rate that the Fed is going to adjust?,"While it is true that if the Federal reserve bank makes a change in their rate there is not an immediate change in the other rates that impact consumers there is some linkage between the federal rate, and the costs of banks and other lenders regarding borrowing money. Of course the cost of borrowing money does impact the costs for businesses looking to expand, which does impact their ability to hire more workers and expand capacity. A change in business expansion does impact employment and unemployment... Then changes in employment can cause a change in raises, which can cause changes in prices which is inflation... Plus the lenders that lend to business see the flow of new loans change as the employment outlook change. If the costs of doing business for the bank changes or the flow of loans change, they do adjust the rates they pay depositors and the rates they charge borrowers... How long it will take to change the cost of an auto loan? No way to tell. Keep in mind that in complex systems, change can be delayed, and wont move in lock step.

TOCOM oil in USD ,"TOCOM Crude is a cashsettled blend of Oman and Dubai crude oil, both quoted in USD. The daily settlement price is mark to market, but the final settlement price is based on reported prices from Dubai and Oman or calculated in some cases with a known procedure, averaged and then converted to Yen using monthly average exchange rates as published by a reference bank see Detailed Rules Youre trying to go all the way back and unfuddle quotes into a blend of USDquoted oils. The correct procedure here would be to go with the Oman and Dubai prices in the first place unless youre trying to arbitrage the TOCOM market. As to why they do it this way? Its a service. TOCOM takes on all the challenges to provide customers with a steady and consistent way of trading cashoil. For physical oil, all youd have to do is buy the blend on Dubais and Omans spot market. You trust TOCOMs price finding process, i.e. there will be no discrepancies between your TOCOM cashoil and the Middle East physical oil. Edit As to why Japan isnt buying WTI directly Theres a considerable cost of carry. WTI delivery location is Cushing, OK there are pipelines but its still a logistics act to get the oil to a port on the West Coast and then have it shipped to Japan. Dubais delivery is at Jebel Ali Persian Gulf, Omani crude can be shipped straight from Mina Al Fahal. Not only is it a shorter trip but also there are more shipping companies specialised in oil deliveries to the Asian hotspots. Why they pay in USD? Persian oil is highly sought after in nearly all of Asias economies but theres little other exported goods from there. So naturally the market for currency crosses AEDJPY, OMRJPY, AEDINR, OMRINR, etc. is not that liquid. At least not as liquid as to make buying Persian oil a smooth deal.

"Can somebody explain leveraged debt investment positions and exposures in this context for me, please?","Exposure is the amount of money that you are at risk of losing on a given position i.e. on a UST 10 year bond, portfolio of positions, strategy selling covered calls for example, or counterparty, usually represented as a percentage of your total assets. Interbank exposure is the exposure of banks to other banks either through owning debt or stock, or by having open positions with the other banks as counterparties. Leveraging occurs when the value of your position is more than the value of what you are trading in. One example of this is borrowing money i.e. creating debt for yourself to buy bonds. The amount of your own funds that you are using to pay for the position is ""leveraged"" by the debt so that you are risking more than 100 of your capital if, for example, the bond became worthless. Another example would be buying futures ""on margin"" where you only put up the margin value of the trade and not the full cost. The problem with these leveraged positions is what happens if a credit event default etc. happens. Since a large amount of the leverage is being ""passed on"" as banks are issuing debt to buy other banks debt who are issuing debt to buy debt there is a risk that a single failure could cause an unravelling of these leveraged positions and, since the prices of the bonds will be falling resulting in these leveraged positions losing money, it will cause a cascade of losses and defaults. If a leveraged position becomes worth less than the amount of real rather than borrowed or margined money that was put up to take the position then it is almost inevitable that the firm in that position will default on the requirements for the leverage. When that firm defaults it sparks all of the firms who own that debt to go through the same problems that it did, hence the contagion.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."

At best, you can bring this down to a negative 25k net worth, or you can start and keep using some of the gains from your investment account to supplement your credit payments along with your income.

Roth vs. Whole Insurance vs. Cash,"CashCDs for a house downpayment  Good. Resist the urge to invest this money unless youre not planning on the house for at least 5 years. Roth IRA  Good. Amounts contributed are able to be withdrawn without tax penalties, though you would really need to be in a crisis for this to be a good idea. Its your longterm, retirement money. The earlier you start, the better. Use your 401K at work, if its offered. Contribute to the Roth as much as you can, as well. Whole life ""Cash value"" life insurance Be careful... Cashvalue life insurance Whole, Universal, Variable Universal must be watched more closely as you age. Once they reach that ""magical"" point of being selfsustaining, you cannot relax. The annual cost of insurance is taken from the cash value, which your premium payments replenish. If you stop making premium payments, eventually the cost of insurance which goes up every year will erode your cash value down to nothing, at which point more premium must be paid to keep the policy in force. This often happens in your old age, when you can least afford the surprise, and costs are highest. Some advisors get messed up in their priorities when they start depending on the 810 commissions they are paid on insurance policies. Since premiums for cashvalue policies are far higher than for term policies, you might get some insight into your advisor if they ignore your attempts to consider a term policy. Because of the insurance costs effects on your cash value, these types of policies are some of the most inefficient and expensive ways to invest. You are better off not investing via a life insurance policy. You dont need life insurance unless someone depends on your financial contribution to their life spouse and children, for example. Some people just like the peace of mind it brings, and some people want a lump sum to leave as a gift to their loved ones which is an expensive way to leave a gift. You can have these ""feelgood"" benefits with a term policy for much less money, if you must have them. Unless you expect to become uninsurable at some point in the future, you should consider using term insurance to meet your life insurance needs until it is no longer needed.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Roth vs. Whole Insurance vs. Cash?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Bank statements  should I retain hardcopies for tax or other official purposes or keep digital scanned copies?,"I am in the United States. There is no need to keep the statements in any form forever. Once the bank gives you a 1099 stating how much interest you have earned, you dont need to keep them. If you only have them in electronic form, that is good enough for the IRS. When you do need to show a bank statement, such as when applying for a loan, the loan company will be keeping a copy. It doesnt matter if it was a scan from the original, from a printed PDF, or if you printed it from your archives. In the US they used send the original check back to the person who wrote it, so they could keep it for their records. Then many banks went to carbons, but if you paid extra they would send you the original. Now the bank that cashes the check scans the check and destroys the original.

Cant the account information on my checks be easily used for fraud?,"Thats accurate. Here is another risk with the current checking system, which many people are not aware of Anyone who knows your checking account number can learn what your balance in that account is. This is bankspecific, but it is possible at the major banks Ive checked. How does that work? Many banks have a phone line where you can dial up and interact with an automated voice response system, for various customer service tasks. One of the options is something like ""merchant check verification"". That option is intended to help a merchant who receives a check to verify whether the person writing the check has enough money in their account for the check to clear. If you select that option in the phone tree, it will prompt you to enter in the account number on the check and the amount of the check, and then it will respond by telling you either ""there are currently sufficient funds in the account to cash this check"" or ""there are not sufficient funds this check would bounce"". Heres how you can abuse this system to learn how much someone has in their bank account, if you know their account number. You call up and check whether theyve enough money to cash a 10,000 check note that you dont actually have to have a check for 10,000 in your hands you just need to know the account number. If the system says ""nope, itd bounce"", then you call again and try 5,000. If the system says ""yup, sufficient funds for a 5,000 check"", then you try 7,500. If it says ""nope, not enough for that"", you try 6,250. Etcetera. At each step, you narrow the range of possible account balances by a factor of two. Consequently, after about a dozen or so steps, you will likely know their balance to within a few dollars. Computer scientists know this procedure by the name ""binary search"". The rest of us may recognize it as akin to a game of ""20 questions"". If this bothers you, you may be able to protect your self by calling up your bank and asking them how to prevent it. When I talked to my bank Bank of America, they told me they could put a fraud alert flag on your account, which would disable the merchant check verification service for my account. It does mean that I have to provide a 3digit PIN any time I phone up my bank, but thats fine with me. I realize many folks may terribly not be concerned about revealing their bank account balance, so in the grand scheme of things, this risk may be relatively minor.

Can you explain why these items are considered negatives on my credit report?,"1. Your oldest active credit agreement is not very old This is fairly straight forward. If youve not been exposed to borrowing for a reasonable length of time, people wont want to lend you money. They have no reason to have any confidence in your ability to repay them. As other said, its pretty much a case of proving yourself by being good with credit over a period of time. 2. You have no active credit card accounts Credit reference agencies have to consider a variety of factors for a variety of purposes. Notably, they will be used for credit cards, unsecured loans, mortgages, and secured loans such as vehicle finance applications. These all have varying types of customer, and some will be inherently more risky than others. For instance, someone with a mortgage on a home is far more likely to make payments because they would be homeless without, however someone with a finance agreement on a car is relatively less likely to make those payments because all they stand to lose is their car. Consider that the most fruitful information the lender will get is a score and some breakdown of how its generated, its a very general understanding of your history. For that reason, having a wide variety of credit is very important. A good variety of credit to have would be one secured loan e.g car finance to get started, as well as at least one revolving unsecured credit account e.g a credit card, and later on in your ""credit life"" an unsecured fixed term loan e.g a loan for something which has nothing secured against it. I say the above reluctantly, because thats how I increased my credit score from 450 to 999  first step was the car finance where in 3 months or so I changed from 450 to around 600, with a credit card I was approaching 900, and once I had an unsecured loan for 8 months I hit 999  now I have all of the above plus a competitive mortgage and remain at 999.

Do real nappies reusable  cloth diapers really save money?,"I just remembered a blog post at CashMoneyLife  Cloth Diapers vs. Disposable Diapers.

Why would anyone want to pay off their debts in a way other than highest interest first?,"It may be the case that some of your debts have a flat regular fee in addition to the interest, which will go away when the debt is completely paid. For example, my mortgage has an approximately 400year ""package fee"" as well as its quite low interest. When I finish paying the mortgage, I wont have to pay that fee anymore, so it is theoretically possible that spending extra money on paying off my mortgage would be better than spending it on paying off some other debt. I think its unlikely that it would actually ever be my optimal move in practice, but the point is, there may be an advantage, financial or otherwise, to getting rid of a particular debt, other than merely removing the burden of interest.

Does this sound like a great idea regarding being a landlord and starting a real estate empire?,"A lot of people do this. For example, in my area nice townhouses go for about 400K, so if you have 80,000 you can buy one and rent it. Here are the typical numbers So you would make 350 per month or 4,200 per year on 80,000 in capital or about 5 profit. What can go wrong 1 The property does not rent and sits vacant. You must come up with 2100 in mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance every month without fail or default. 2 Unexpected expenses. A new furnaces costs over 5,000. A new roof costs 7,000. A new appliance costs 600 to 2000 depending on how upscale your property is. I just had a toilet fixed for a leaky plunger. It cost me 200. As you can see maintenance expenses can quickly get a lot higher than the 50 shown above... and not only that, if you fix things as cheaply as possible as most landlords do, not only does that decrease the rentability of the property, but it causes stuff to break sooner. 3 Deadbeats. Some people will rent your property and then not pay you. Now you have a property with no income, you are spending 2100 per month to pay for it, AND you are facing steep attorney fees to get the deadbeats evicted. They can fight you in court for months. 4 Damage, wear and tear. Whenever a tenant turns over there is always a lot of broken or worn stuff that has to be fixed. Holes in the wall need to be patched. Busted locks, broken windows, nonworking toilets, stains on the carpet, stuck doors, ripped screens, leaky showers, broken tiles, painting exterior trim, painting walls, painting fences, etc. You can spend thousands every time a tenant changes. Other caveats Banks are much more strict about loaning to non home owners. You usually have to have reserve income. So, if you have little or no income, or you are stretched already, it will be difficult to get commercial loans. For example, lets say your takehome pay is 7,000 and you have no mortgage at all you rent, then it is fine, the bank will loan you the money. But lets say you only have 5,000 in take home pay and you have an 1,800 mortgage on your own home. In that case it is very unlikely a bank will allow you to assume a 2nd mortgage on a rental property. The more you try to borrow, the more reserve income the bank will require.

Longer answer the two account types USED to differ but that changed a few years ago maybe circa 2011?. PayPal wants persontoperson payments to be free except where they must pass along credit card charges or else they would loose their shirt but wants to charge merchants for receiving payments. Originally PayPal required merchants to have premier or business accounts, and charged fees for payments made to those account types. Personal accounts had significant limitations on receiving payments, but did not pay fees upon receiving payments. Eventually PayPal decoupled the question of ""is this a persontoperson payment or a payment to a merchant for goods and services?"" from the paypal account type. So now the same account can receive both a p2p payment e.g. splitting lunch costs, on which it will NOT pay fees, and can receive a payment for goods or services e.g. from a web checkout, on which it WILL pay fees.

Would I ever need credit card if my debit card is issued by MasterCardVisa?,"You ask about the difference between credit and debit, but that may be because youre missing something important. Regardless of creditdebit, there is value in carrying two different cards associated with two different accounts. The reason is simply that because of loss, fraud, or your own mismanagement, or even the banks technical error, any card can become unusable for some period of time. Exactly how long depends what happened, but just sending you a new card can easily take more than one business day, which might well be longer than youd like to go without access to any funds. In that situation you would be glad of a credit card, and you would equally be glad of a second debit card on a separate account. So if your question is ""I have one bank account with one debit card, and the only options Im willing to contemplate are a do nothing or b take a credit card as well"", then the answer is yes, take a credit card as well, regardless of the pros or cons of credit vs debit. Even if you only use the credit card in the event that you drop your debit card down a drain. So what you can now consider is the pros and cons of a credit card vs managing an additional bank account  unless you seriously hate one or more of the cons of credit cards, the credit card is likely to win. My bank has given me a debit card on a cash savings account, which is a little scary, but would cover most emergencies if I didnt have a credit card too. Of course the interest rate is rubbish and I sometimes empty my savings account into a better investment, so I dont use it as backup, but I could. Your final question ""can a merchant know if I give him number of debit or credit card"" is already asked Can merchants tell the difference between a credit card and embossed debit card? Yes they can, and yes there are a few things you cant or might prefer not to do with debit.

Was on debt..can I now enter UK on visitor visa,"Whether or not youll be allowed to enter the UK is a topic for a different forum and really more a topic for a lawyer rather than strangers on the internet. That being said, as a nonlawyer giving my opinion of the situation, you should be granted access to the UK as the banksmoney lendersphone companies dont have a relationship with Border Entry. With regards to debts in the UK, there is some precedent to debts being waived after a certain period of time, but the minimum is 6 years for unsecured debt, and the companies you owe money to can still chase you for payment, but cant use legal proceedings to force you to pay. However, the big caveat to this is that this only applies to residents of England and Wales. From the cleardebt.co.uk site What is out of date debt? Debts like these are covered by the Limitation Act 1980, which is a statute of limitations that provides time scales as to how long a creditor can chase you the debtor for an unpaid debt. The Limitation Act 1980 only applies when no acknowledgement of a debt has been made between you and the creditor for six years for unsecured debts or 12 years for mortgage shortfalls and secured loans. This law only applies to residents of England and Wales. When does debt go out of date? If the creditor fails to maintain contact with you for six years or more, you may be able to claim that the outstanding debt is statute barred under the Limitation Act 1980. This means the creditor cannot use the legal system to enforce payment of the outstanding debt. The time limit starts from when you last acknowledged owing the debt or made a payment to the account. When can a creditor pursue an unsecured debt? You may think a creditor has written off your debt if you havent heard from them for a long time. The reality is that the debt still exists. The creditor can still contact you and they are entitled to chase the outstanding debt, even if the debt has been statute barred, but they are unable to use legal proceedings to force you to pay.

Is there legal reason for restricting someone under 5912 from an inservice rollover from a 401K to an IRA?,"Youre going to find a lot of conflicting or vague answers on the internet because there are a lot of plan design elements that are set by the plan sponsor employer. There are laws that mandate certain elements and dictate certain requirements of plan sponsors, many of these laws are related to record keeping and fiduciary duty. There is a lot of latitude for plan sponsors to allow or restrict employee actions even if there is no law against that activity. There are different rules mandated for employee pretax contributions, employee posttax contributions, and employer contributions. You have more flexibility with regard to the employer contributions and any post tax contributions you may have made your plan may allow an inservice distribution of those two items before you reach age 59.5.

Why is it good to borrow money to buy a house?,"First, who is saying that it is a better option? In general it is best to pay cash for things when you can. I think the reality is that for most people owning a house would be very difficult without some sort of financing. That said, one argument for financing a house these days even if you could afford to pay cash is that the interest rates are very low. For a 30year fixed loan you can borrow money under 4.5 APR with decent credit. If you are willing to accept even a little risk you could almost certainly invest that same money and get a return higher than 4.5. With the US mortgage interest tax deduction the numbers are even more favorable for financing. Those rates look even more attractive when you consider you are paying for the house with todays dollars and paying back the loan with dollars from up to 30 years in the future, which will be worth much less.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is it good to borrow money to buy a house?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why could rental costs for apartmentshouses rise while buying prices can go up and down?,"At 5, this means you expect rents to double every 14 years. I bought a condo style apartment 28 years ago, sold a while back, by the way and recently saw the going rate for rents has moved up from 525 to 750, after all this time. The rent hasnt increased four fold. If rents appear to be too low compared to the cost of buying the house, people tend to prefer to rent. On the flip side, if the rent can cover a mortgage and then some, theres strong motivation to buy, if not by the renters, then by investors who seek a high return from renting those houses, thereby pushing the price up. The price to rent ratio isnt fixed, it depends in part on interest rates, consumer sentiment, and banks willingness to lend.

Does it make sense to trade my GOOGL shares for GOOG and pocket the difference?,"It appears very possible that Google will not have to pay any class C holders the settlement amount, given the structure of the settlement. This is precisely because of the arbitrage opportunity youve highlighted. This idea was mentioned last summer in Dealbreaker. As explained in a Dealbook article The settlement requires Google to pay the following amounts if, one year from the issuance of the Class C shares, the value diverges according to the following formula If the C share price is equal to or more than 1 percent, but less than 2 percent, below the A share price, 20 percent of the difference If the C share price is equal to or more than 2 percent, but less than 3 percent, below the A share price, 40 percent of the difference If the C share price is equal to or more than 3 percent, but less than 4 percent, below the A share price, 60 percent of the difference If the C share price is equal to or more than 4 percent, but less than 5 percent, below the A share price, 80 percent of the difference. If the C share price is equal to or more than 5 percent below the A share price, 100 percent of the difference, up to 5 percent. ... If the Class A shares trade around 450 after the splitC issuance and the C shares trade at a 4.5 percent discount during the year or 429.75 per share, then investors expect a payment of 80 percent times 450 times 4.5 percent  16.20. The value of C shares would then be 445.95 429.75 plus 16.20. But if this is the new trading value during the year, thats only a discount of less than 1 percent to the A shares. So no payment would be made. But if no payment is made, we are back to the full discount and this continues ad infinitum. In other words, the value of a stock can be displayed as equity value  dividend value  voting value  settlement value  total share value If we ignore dividend and voting values, and ignore premiums and discounts for risk and so forth, then the value of a share is basic equity value plus anticipated settlement payoff. The Google Class C settlement is structured to reduce the payoff as the value converges. And the practice of arbitrage guarantees if you buy into at least semistrong EMH that the price of C shares will be shored up by arbitrageurs that want the payoff. The voting value of GOOGL is effectively zero, since the nontraded Class B shares control all company decisions. So the value of the Class A GOOGL voting is virtually zero for the time being. The only divergence between GOOGL and GOOG price is dividends which I believe is supposed to be the same and the settlement payoff. Somebody who places zero value on the vote and who expects dividend difference to be zero should always prefer to buy GOOG to GOOGL until the price is equal, disregarding the settlement. So technically someone is better off owning GOOG, if dividends are the same and market prices are equal, just because the vote is worthless and the nonzero chance of a future settlement payoff is gravy. The arbitrage itself is present because a share that costs as in the article 429.75 is worth 445.95 if the settlement pays out at that rate. The stable equilibrium is probably either just before or just after the threshold where the settlement pays off, depending on how reliably arbitrageurs can predict the movement of GOOG and GOOGL. If I can buy a given stock for X but know that its worth X1, then Im willing to pay up to X1. In the google case, the GOOG stock is worth XS, where S is an uncertain settlement payment that could be zero or could be substantial. We have six tiers of S counting zero payoff, so that the price is likely to follow a pattern from X to XS5 to XS5S4 to XS4S3, and climbing the tier ladder until it lands in the frontier between XS1 and XS0. Every time it jumps into XS1, people should be willing to pay that new amount for GOOG, so the price moves out of payoff range and into XS0, where people will only pay X. Im actually simplifying here, since technically this is all based on future expectations. So the actual price youd pay is expressed thus resale value of GOOG before settlement payoff  X   expectation that settlement payoff will pay 100 of difference  S5  expected nominal difference between GOOG and GOOGL  D   S4  80 D  S3  60 D  S2  40 D  S1  20 D  S0  0 D  price willing to pay for Class C GOOG  P Plus youd technically have to present value the whole thing for the time horizon, since the payoff is in a year. Note that Ive shunted any votingdividend analysis into X. Its reasonable to thing that S5, S4, S3, and maybe S2 are nearly zero, given the open arbitrage opportunity. And we know that S0 times 0 of D is zero. So the real analysis, again ignoring PV, is thus P  X  S1D Which is a long way of saying what are the odds that GOOG will happen to be worth no more than 99 of GOOGL on the payoff determination date?",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Does it make sense to trade my GOOGL shares for GOOG and pocket the difference?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Im upside down on my car loan and need a different car, what can I do?","Before buying a new car, determine whether you really need one! If theres an automotive discussion, you should ask there FIRST to get opinions on how much allwheeldrive helps. You may not want to change cars at all. Remember, most of us in the Northeast are NOT driving allwheeldrive vehicles, and all cars have allwheel brakes. Allwheel drive is better at getting you moving from a stop if one of the drive wheels would otherwise be slipping. It makes less difference during actual driving. Traction control braking is much more important  and much more common, hence much cheaper. And probably already present in your Camry. And good tires make a huge difference. Topoftheline allseason tires are adequate, but many folks do switch to snow tires during the winter and switch back again in summer. Tires  even if you get a second set of rims to put them on  are a heck of a lot cheaper than changing cars. Beyond everything else, driving in winter conditions is a matter of careful practice. Most of the time, simply avoiding making sudden startsstopsturns and not driving like youre in a video arcade ""gotta pass three more or I lose my game!"" will do the job.

Not paying cash for a house,"The common opinion is an oversimplification at best. The problem with buying a house using cash is that it may leave you cashpoor, forcing you to take out a home equity loan at some point... which may be at a higher rate than the mortgage would have been. On the other hand, knowing that you have no obligation to a lender is quite nice, and many folks prefer eliminating that source of stress. IF you can get a mortgage at a sufficiently low rate, using it to leverage an investment is not a bad strategy. Average historical return on the stock market is around 8, so any mortgage rate lower than that is a relatively good bet and a rate MUCH lower as now is that much better a bet. There is, of course, some risk involved and the obligation to make mortgage payments, and your actual return is reduced by what youre paying on the mortage... but its still a pretty good deal. As far as investment vehicles The same answers apply as always. You want a rate of return higher than what youre paying on the mortgage, preferably market rate of return or better. CDs wont do it, as youve found. Youre going to have to increase the risk to increase the return. That does mean picking and maintaining a diversified balance of investments and investment types. Working with index funds makes diversifying within a type easy, but youre probably going to want both stocks and bonds, rebalancing between them when they drift too far from your desired mix. My own investments are a specific mix with one each of bond fund, large cap fund, small cap fund, REIT, and international fund. Bonds are the biggest part of that, since theyre lowest risk, but the others play a greater part in producing returns on the investments. The exact mix that would be optimal for you depends on your risk tolerance Im classified as a moderately aggressive investor, the time horizon youre looking at before you may be forced to pull money back out of the investments, and some matters of personal taste. Ive been averaging about 10, but I had the luxury of being able to ride out the depression and indeed invest during it. Against that, my mortgage is under 4 interest rate, and is for less than 80 of the purchase price so I didnt need to pay the surcharge for mortgage insurance. In fact, I borrowed only half the cost of the house and paid the rest in cash, specifically because leveraging does involve some risk and this was the level of risk I was comfortable with. I also set the duration of the loan so it will be paid off at about the same time I expect to retire. Again, thats very much a personal judgement. If you need specific advice, its worth finding a financial counselor and having them help you run the numbers. Do NOT go with someone associated with an investment house theyre going to be biased toward whatever produces the most income for them. Select someone who is strictly an advisor they may cost you a bit more but theyre more likely to give you useful advice. Dont take my word for any of this. I know enough to know how little I know.

At what percentage drop should you buy to average down,"A big part of the answer depends on how ""beaten down"" the stock is, how long it will take to recover from the drop, and your taste for risk. If you honestly believe the drop is a temporary aberration then averaging down can be a good strategy to lower your dollarcost average in the stock. But this is a huge risk if youre wrong, because now youre going to magnify your losses by piling on more stock that isnt going anywhere to the shares you already own at a higher cost. As Mindwin pointed out correctly, the problem for most investors following an ""average down"" strategy is that it makes them much less likely to cut their losses when the stock doesnt recover. They basically become ""married"" to the stock because theyve actualized their belief the stock will bounce back when maybe it never will or worse, drops even more.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: At what percentage drop should you buy to average down?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Could an exemployee of a company find themself stranded with shares they cannot sell and a tax bill?,"It would take an unusual situation. They exercise certain types of option, which come in as regular income rather than capital gains, and are holding the stock ""long"" perhaps they are not allowed to sell because of an insidertrading freeze window like right before earnings announcements. And then the stock tanks. Their company is acquired. They get stock options in their unicorn at 1share, which blows up to 1000share right as HugeFirm buys it. Options are swapped dollarfordollar for HugeFirm stock at 250share so 4 shares for 1. I heard this happened a lot in the 19992000 boombust. And the problem was, this type of stockoption had historically only been offered to 20million salary CEOs and CFOs, who retained professional legal and financial counsel and knew how to deal with the pitfalls and traps of this type of option. During the dotcom boom, it was also offered to rankandfile 50k salary tech employees who didnt even know the difference between a 401K and a Roth.

Are there any catches with interest from banks? Is this interest too good to be true?,"The 1.09 is per year, not per month.

First time home buyer. How to negotiate price?,"First of all, never ask a realtor for advice. The realtor represents the SELLER. Blankips advice above is by far the most accurate of the previous answers. The first step is to estimate the market. Look at past sales in the neighborhood over time, and from them estimate the prospects for the house at different time durations. Based on other sales, how fast do you think the house will sell at a given price? 60 days, 90 days, a year? If a house is high priced, that means the seller is prepared to wait. He is saying ""I am happy to wait a year to find somebody who will pay this."" Next, who is the owner? Young professional? Retiring couple? Landlord? Flipper? Who is it? The more you know about the owner, the better. Everybody has a time table, you need to find out what that is. Next, what is YOUR timetable? You need the house by the end of the month, or by the end of the year, or never, which is it? Objectively rate the house. Plusses and minuses. Good houses are those which everybody else hates and you love. You will get the best price there. Assuming you need to find a house in 90 days Based on these considerations determine the lowest price you think the owner will accept in a 30day time frame. Make a written offer with an address and email, no phone number. If he comes back with a counter offer, ignore it. If for some reason a realtor has your number and calls you, tell them ""My written offer speaks for itself. I have nothing further to say."" It is very important not to entertain haggling or counter offers. Dont even pick up the phone. He has your WRITTEN offer. He can email or write you I accept. If the 30days elapse, move onto your 2 choice and make a more aggressive offer. If that doesnt work, go to choice 3 and accept the listed price. This strategy may seem counterintuitive because the natural tendency for people is to want to communicate. Trust me the way to succeed in a negotiation is to NOT communicate. Make your offer and that is that. That is the pro way to do it, and will produce the best result for a shortterm situtation. Long term situation If you are an investor ""flipper"", or have a lot of time to waitspend, you can use a different strategy which involves pressuring the seller. What you do here is find a property you want in which the owner is vulnerable. That means someone who is old, bankrupt, out of work, indicted and on their way to prison or already in prison, etc. Bank owned properties fall into this category. In this case you figure out the 6month price or however long you are willing to work on it. Then you pester the person. Become their buddy. Visit them in prison. Take the bank officer to lunch. Show up on holidays. Invite them to Thanksgiving. Start a relationship. Every two weeks you pester them. Want to sell yet? Want to sell yet? You basically harass them until they capitulate. Maybe it takes 6 months. Maybe it takes 2 years. Eventually they will give in. By this means you can get a much better deal than in strategy 1 above, but it takes a lot more time and effort and is appropriate more for an investor.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: First time home buyer.

In what state should I register my webbased LLC?,"I have researched this question extensively in previous years as we have notoriously high taxes in California, while neighboring a state that has zero corporate income tax and personal income tax. Many have attempted pull a fast one on the California taxation authorities, the Franchise Tax Board, by incorporating in Nevada or attempting to declare fullyear residence in the Silver State. This is basically just asking for an audit, however. California religiously examines taxpayers with any evidence of having presence in California. If they deem you to be a resident in California, and they likely will based on the fact that you live in California physical presence, you will be subject to taxation on your worldwide income. You could incorporate in Nevada or Bangladesh, and California will still levy its taxation on any business income Single Member LLCs are disregarded as separate corporate entities, but still taxed at ordinary income rates on the personal income tax basis. To make things worse, if California examines your Single Member LLC and finds that it is doing business in California, based on the fact that its sole owner is based in California all year long, you could feasibly end up with additional penalties for having neglected to file your LLC in California California LLCs are considered domestic, and only file in California unless they wish to do business in other states Nevada LLCs are considered foreign to California, requiring the owner to file a domestic LLC organization in Nevada and then a foreign LLC organization in California, which still gets hit with the minimum 800 franchise fee because it is a foreign LLC doing business in California. Evading any filing responsibility in California is not advisable. FTB consistently researches LLCs, SCorporations and the like to determine whether theyve been organized outofstate but still principally operated in California, thus having a tax nexus with California and the subsequent requirement to be filed in California and taxed by California. No one likes paying taxes, and no one wants to get hit with franchise fees, especially when one is starting a new venture and that minimum 800 assessment seems excessive in other words, you could have a company that earns nothing, zero, zip, nada, and still has to pay the 800 minimum fee, but the consequences of shirking tax laws and filing requirements will make the franchise fee seem trivial in comparison. If youre committed to living in California and desire to organize an LLC or SCorp, you must file with the state of California, either as a domestic corporationLLC or foreign corporationLLC doing business in California. The only alternatives are being a sole proprietor unincorporated, or leaving the state of California altogether.

Formula that predicts whether one is better off investing or paying down debt,"you should always invest if your investment rate of return is higher than your interest rate Your next line, about standard deviation is dead on.

Clearly, theres one extreme, the 18 credit card. Unless you are funding loanshark type rates of 2week, its safe to say that 18 debt should take priority over any investments, except for the matched 401k deposits. What I think youre talking about is something weve addressed here in multiple threads. Do I prepay my sub 4 mortgage or invest? In this case, and to Noahs comment the question is whether you can expect a posttax return of over 3 during your time horizon. I look at the return for 15 years from 19982013 and see a 6 CAGR for the SP. I chose 15 years, as the choice is often one of paying a 30 year mortgage faster, as fast as 15. The last 15 years offer a pretty bad scenario, 2 crashes and a mortgage crisis. 6 after long term gains would get you 5.1 net. You can pull the data back to 1871 and run CAGR numbers for the timeframe of your choosing. I havent done it yet, but I imagine theres no 15 year span that lags the 3 target I cite. What makes it more complex is that the investment isnt lump sum. It may not be obvious, but CAGR is a dollar invested at T0, and returns calculated to Tfinal year. It would take a bit of spreadsheeting to invest the extra funds every monthyear over your period of analysis. In the end, there are still those who will choose to pay off their 4 mortgage regardless of what the numbers show. Even if the 15 year result showed worst case 3.5 almost no profit and an average 10, the feeling of risk is more than many will want.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."

Why does the biotechnology industry have such a high PE ratio?,"If you look at the biotech breakdown, youll find a lot of NAs when it comes to PE since there are many young biotech companies that have yet to make a profit. Thus, there may be something to be said for how is the entire industry stat computed. Biotechnology can include pharmaceutical companies that can have big profits due to patents on drugs. As an example, look at Shire PLC which has a PE of 1243 which is pretty high with a Market Capitalization of over a billion dollars, so this isnt a small company. I wonder what dotcom companies would have looked like in 19981999 that could well be similar as some industries will have bubbles you do realize, right? The reason for pointing out the Market Capitalization is that this a way to measure the size of a company, as this is merely the sum of all the stock of the company. There could be small companies that have low market capitalizations that could have high PEs as they are relatively young and could be believed to have enough hype that there is a great deal of confidence in the stock. For example, Amazon.com was public for years before turning a profit. In being without profits, there is no PE and thus it is worth understanding the limitations of a PE as the computation just takes the previous years earnings for a company divided by the current stock price. If the expected growth rate is high enough this can be a way to justify a high PE for a stock. The question you asked about an industry having this is the derivation from a set of stocks. If most of the stocks are high enough, then whatever mean or median one wants to use as the ""industry average"" will come from that.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why does the biotechnology industry have such a high PE ratio?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it possible to influence a companys actions by buying stock?,"Energy Transfer Partners, LP stock symbol ETP is the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Since ETP is a publicly traded company, it is certainly possible to purchase the stock. To answer your questions Would it not be possible to buy their stocks, bring down the price of the stocks and keep it there until investors pull out because it is financially unwise to these investors? You cannot artificially bring the price of a stock down by buying the stock. Purchasing large enough amounts would theoretically cause the price to go up, not down. You could theoretically cause the stock to go down by shorting the stock borrowing shares and then selling them, but it would take a lot of shares to do this, and may not be successful. If not successful, your losses are potentially unlimited. Would it alternatively be possible to buy enough stock to have a voice in the operations of the company? Yes, you could theoretically purchase enough of the stock to control the company. The market capitalization of ETP is currently 17.9 Billion if you owned half of the stock, you would have complete control of the company. But buying that much stock would certainly influence the price of the stock, so it would cost you more than half of that amount to buy that much stock. You could get yourself a voice at the table for less without owning a full half of the stock, but you would not have full control, and would need support from others to get the outcome you want. Alternatively, someone determined to exert their influence could theoretically make an offer to purchase the Dakota Access subsidiary from ETP, which might be less costly than purchasing half of the entire corporation. Even if an extremely wealthy person were to try one of these options and destroy this company, it wouldnt necessarily stop another company from building something similar.

Why are currency forwards needed?,"To speak to this a little more broadly apart from groups like hedge funds and other investors investing for purely speculative purposes, one of the major purposes of forwards and, for that matter, futures for companies in the ""real economy"" is to ""lock in"" a particular price in advance or to reduce the risk of some kind of investment or transaction. Investopedia defines a currency forward as follows with a few key points emphasized [A currency forward is] a binding contract in the foreign exchange market that locks in the exchange rate for the purchase or sale of a currency on a future date. A currency forward is essentially a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment. The other major benefit of a currency forward is that it can be tailored to a particular amount and delivery period, unlike standardized currency futures. This can be a major advantage for planning and risk management purposes. For example, if I know Im going to have to pay 1 million USD in the future and most of my revenue is in Euros, the actual amount Ill have to pay will vary based on the exchange rate between Euros and dollars. Thus, its very worthwhile for me to be able to ""lock in"" a particular exchange rate so that I know exactly how much Im going to pay relative to my projected revenue. The goal isnt necessarily to make money off the transaction maybe they do, maybe they dont as much as to reduce risk and improve planning ability. The fact that it doesnt involve an upfront payment is also a major advantage. Its usually a bad practice to ""sit on"" cash for a year if you can avoid it.

What could be the harm in sharing my American Express statements online?,"As a person who has had several part time assistants in the past I will offer you a simple piece of advise that should apply regardless of what country the assistant is located. If you have an assistant, personal or business, virtual or otherwise, and you dont trust that person with this type of information, get a different assistant. An assistant is someone who is supposed to make your life easier by off loading work. Modifying your records before sending them every month sounds like you are creating more work for yourself not less. Either take the leap of faith to trust your assistant or go somewhere else. An assistant that you feel you have to edit crucial information from is less than useful. That being said, there is no fundamental reason to believe that an operation in the Philippines or anywhere else is any more or less trustworthy than an operation in your native country. However, what is at issue is the legal framework around your relationship and in particular your recourse if something goes wrong. If you and your virtual assistant are both located in the US you would have an easier time collecting damages should something go wrong. I suggest you evaluate your level of comfort for risk vs. cost. If you feel that the risk is too high to use an overseas service versus the savings, then find someone in the states to do this work. Depending on your needs and comfort you might want to seek out a CPA or other licensedbonded professional. Yes the cost might be higher however you might find that it is worth it for your own piece of mind. As a side note you might even consider finding a local parttime assistant. This can often be more useful than a virtual assistant and may not cost as much as you think. If you can live without someone being bonded. or are willing to pay for the bonding fee yourself, depending on your market and needs you may be able to find an existing highly qualified EA or other person that wants some after hours work. If you are in a college town, finance, accounting or legal majors make great assistants. They will usually work a couple hours a week for ""beer money"", they have flexible schedules and are glad to have something pertinent to their degree to put on their resume when they graduate.

Is 401k as good as it sounds given the way it is taxed?,"If you pay 20 tax now and none later or if you pay no tax now and 20 later, it doesnt make a difference. Mathematically, its the same. You have to guess about which tax rate now vs later will be higher for you in order for you to make the best choice. Predicting tax rates 40 years in advance is hard. Everybody pretends like they can do this accurately. I would suggest going half and half. If you have 20k and put half in pretax 10k in and half in posttax only 8k in you end up with 18k total in which is right in the middle of where you would be if you went with the whole 20k in either extreme. It would also leave you owing 2k in tax rather than the possible 4k in tax if you had gone with all pretax. When you split down the middle, you are guaranteed to have 50 in the ""right"" side, the side with the best outcome. Being guaranteed to be 50 on the right side is pretty good compared to maybe being 100 on the wrong side.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

What would I miss out on by self insuring my car?,"Convenience, and of course money. In case of an event, youll have to spend the full worth of money to fixreplace, while if youre insured  you get the insurance to pay for it. It is up to you to decide, if the money saved on the lower premiums worth the risk of paying much more in case of an event. Of course, the cheaper the car the more it makes sense not to pay the premiums. Many people do that. Regarding the bargaining power, I actually think that you would pay less if it is not going through insurance than the bill the insurance pays. I fixed a nasty dent for like 300 at one shop, while at the other they said ""Its 1200, but what do you care, your insurance will cover it"" I had 500 deductible, so in the end it was cheaper for me to pay 300 without the insurance at all.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What would I miss out on by self insuring my car?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

If he is really not going to be taxed on the other country, residing there would seem sensible. But... In Canada residency for tax purposes is established for an entire year. If you are resident for more than six months your salary for the year is taxable. Conversely if you are present for less than six months you are not taxable. This may have changed  its been twenty years since I did this. The other issue is healthcare. If you are not resident in Ontario you are not eligible for free healthcare, I believe.

"Working abroad in Australia, what is involved financially and administratively?","We dont seem to have many expats or Australians on the site yet, but Ill share what I have learned. Im taking advantage of your profile information listing you as a software developer. A friend of mine is currently doing a study of national IT professional societies for his MBA project. One of his goals is to understand which funding models are effective in the absence of mandatory licensing. Consider Most developers dont need to be a member of an organization in order to practice. Such organizations you or others may be familiar with are the British Computer Society BCS, the Canadian Information Processing Society CIPS, or in the U.S. the Association for Computing Machinery ACM and IEEE Computer Society IEEECS. To the point My friend told me recently that the Australian Computer Society ACS makes money by assisting the Australian government in determining immigration eligibility. So I went to the ACS site and started digging ""The Australian Computer Society ACS is the designated professional assessing authority for persons seeking to apply for Skilled Migration as IT Computing Professionals [...]"" See ACSs Preapplication Skills Assessment PASA page. That page also links out to the Australian Governments Department of Immigration and Citizenship, in particular to a document titled General Skilled Migration PDF. Here are some interesting points I discovered, relating just to fees The government recommends if you do want professional help to use a registered migration agent. There will be fees for such an agent. See MARA  What does it cost to use an Agent? Currently AUD1500  AUD4000, or  850   2270. There will be a fee for the immigration application process itself. See Professionals and other Skilled Migrants visa charges  outside Australia. Currently total of AUD 6035, or  3420. Also ""You also need to have your skills assessed by the relevant assessing authority as suitable for working in your nominated occupation."" page 7 ... and you need to do that before you even apply. The ACS Costs and Charges page shows a cost of AUD 400, or  225, for the PASA General application. So, I think the answer is yes, youd certainly want to have ample savings to cover the red tape stuff perhaps  6000 judging from the above alone.

You could also wait until you complete your taxes this spring, then see if you needed to make an adjustment to your exemptions. If you normally get a large refund then you should be increasing your exemptions anyway. If you are always writing a check to the IRS then you werent getting enough withheld.

Im halfway through a 5year purchase financing deal on my car. Its expensive. Can I sell it and get a cheaper car?,"You say ""its expensive"". Im going to interpret this as ""the monthly payments are too high"". Basically, you need to get your old loan paid off, presumably by selling the car you have now. This is the tough part. If you sold the car now, how much would you get for it? You can use Kelley Blue Book to figure out what the car is roughly worth. Thats not a guarantee that it will actually sell for that much. Look in your local classifieds to see what similar cars are selling for. Keep in mind that you will usually get less for your old car if you trade it in versus sell it yourself. Now, if you owe more than your car is worth, youre in a really tight spot. If you dont get enough money when you sell it, you are still stuck with the remainder of the loan. In that case, it is usually best to just stick with the car you have, and be more cautious about payments and loan length the next time you finance a car. Penalties Most car loans dont have any kind of early repayment penalty. However, you should check your loan paperwork just to make sure.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Im halfway through a 5year purchase financing deal on my car.

Why can it be a bad idea to buy stocks after hours?,"The sentiment is because between closing and opening a lot can happen, and between opening and the time your order actually goes through, even more can happen. An afterhours trade has an extra amount of shortterm risk attached the price of a stock at the opening bell is technically the same as its price as of the closing the previous trading day, but within a tenth of a second, which is forever in a computerized exchange, that price may move drastically one way or the other, based on news and on other markets. The sentiment, therefore, is simple if youre trading afterhours, youre trading risky. Youre not trading based on what the markets actually doing, youre trading based on what you think the market will do in the morning, and theres still more math going on every second in the privatelyheld supercomputers in rented cubes in the NYSE basement than you could do all night, digesting this news and projecting what its going to do to the stocks. Now, if youve done your homework and the stock looks like a good longterm buy, with or without any afterhours news, then place the order at 3 in the morning who cares what the stocks gonna do at the opening bell.

Should I invest or repay my debts?,"Like azam pointed out, fundamentally you need to decide if the money invested elsewhere will grow faster than the Interest you are paying on the loan. In India, the safe returns from Fixed Deposits is around 89 currently. Factoring taxes, the real rate of return would be around 67. This is less than what you are paying towards interest. The PPF gives around 9 with Tax break [if there are no other options] and tax free interest, the real return can be as high as 1214. There is a limit on how much you can invest in PPF. However this looks higher than your average interest. The stock markets in long term [7 Years] averages give you around 15 returns, but are not predictable year to year. So the suggest from azam is valid, you would need to see what are the high rate of interest loans and if they accept early repayment, you should complete it ASAP. If there are loans that are less than average, say in the range of 78, you can keep it and pay as per schedule.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."
How much should I be contributing to my 401k given my employers contribution?,"JoeTapayer has good advice here. I would like to add my notes. If they give a 50 match that means you are getting a 50 return on investmentROI immediately. I do not know of a way to get a better guaranteed ROI. Next, when investing you need to determine what kind of investor you are. I would suggest you make yourself more literate in investments, as I suggest to anyone, but there are basic things you want to look for. If your primary worry is loss of your prinicipal, go for Conservative investments. This means that you are willing to accept a reduced expected ROI in exchange for lower volatilityrisk of loss of principal. This does not mean you have a 100 safe investment as the last market issues have shown, but in general you are better protected. The fidelity investments should give you some information as to volatility or if they deem the investments conservative. Conservative investments are normally made up of trading bonds, which have the lowest ROI in general but are the most secure. You can also invest in blue chip companies, although stock is inherently riskier. It is pointed out in comments that stocks always outperform bonds in the long term, and this has been true over the last 100 years. I am just suggesting ways you can protect yourself against market downturns. When the market is doing very well bonds will not give you the return your friends are seeing. I am just trying to give you a basic idea of what to look for when you pick your investments, nothing can replace a solid investment adviser and taking the time to educate yourself.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Using a cash account can someone trade all day on it?,"According to Regulation T, you can make as many day trade round trip stock purchases using a cash account as long as you have the funds to cover each and every round trip sale.

Since its not really worthwhile doing a estimated cost for everything that you have, Id just report it as income like you are doing and let the amount of equity increase proportionately.

Can one get a house mortgage without buying a house?,"Ive never heard of a loan product like that. Yes, if they keep the funds in an account, it is no risk to the bank, but they would essentially need to go through the loan process twice for the same loan when you pick a house, they need to reevaluate everything, along with appraising and approving the house. Even if you did find a bank that would do this for you, there are a few problems with this scheme. You would be paying interest before you have a need for this money, negating the savings you might achieve if the interest rates go up. In addition, your ""balance"" will go down as ""payments"" are deducted from your loan, and when you finally find a home to buy, you might not have enough for the house you want. Youll need to borrow more than you need, which will further negate any possible savings. It is impossible to know how fast rates will climb. If I were you, I would stick to saving for your down payment, and just get the best rate you can when you are ready to buy. Another potential idea for you is to lock an interest rate. When you apply for a mortgage, the interest rate is often locked for as much as 60 days, to protect the borrower in the event that the rates go up. You could ask the bank if you can pay a fee to lock the rate even longer. I dont know if that is possible or not.

IRS convenience of the employer test when employee lives far from the office,"Im not a tax professional, but as I understand it, you are not expected to commute from San Francisco to Boston.  If your employer has not provided you with an external office, then yes, you have very likely met the ""convenience of the employer"" test. However, to take the home office deduction, there are many requirements that have to be met. You can read more at the Nolo article Can You Deduct Your Home Office When Youre an Employee? Thanks, keshlam The home office deduction has many nuances and is enough of an IRS red flag that you would be welladvised to talk to an accountant about it. You need to be able to show that it is exclusively and necessarily used for your job. Another thing to remember as an employee, the home office deduction, if you take it, will be deducted on Schedule A, line 21 unreimbursed employee expenses, among other Miscellaneous Deductions. Deductions in this section need to exceed 2 of your adjusted gross income before you can start to deduct. So it will not be worth it to pursue the deduction if your income is too high, or your housing expenses are too low, or your office is too small compared to the rest of your house, or you dont itemize deductions.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: IRS convenience of the employer test when employee lives far from the office?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Small investing for spending money?,"Just to offer another alternative, consider Certificates of Deposit CDs at an FDIC insured bank or credit union for small or shortterm investments. If you dont need access to the money, as stated, and are not willing to take much risk, you could put money into a number of CDs instead of investing it in stocks, or just letting it sit in a regular savingschecking account. You are essentially lending money to the bank for a guaranteed length of time anywhere from 3 to 60 months, and therefore they can give you a better rate of return than a savings account which is basically lending it to them with the condition that you could ask for it all back at any time. Your rate of return in CDs is lower a typical stock investment, but carries no risk at all. CD rates typically increase with the length of the CD. For example, my credit union currently offers a 2.3 APY on a 5year CD, but only 0.75 for 12 month CDs, and a mere 0.1 APY on regular savingschecking accounts. Putting your full 10K deposit into one or more CDs would yield 230 a year instead of a mere 10 in their savings account. If you go this route with some or all of your principal, note that withdrawing the money from a CD before the end of the deposit term will mean forfeiting the interest earned. Some banks may let you withdraw just a portion of a CD, but typically not. Work around this by splitting your funds into multiple CDs, and possibly different term lengths as well, to give you more flexibility in accessing the funds. Personally, I have a rolling emergency fund 6 months living expenses, separate from all investments and daytoday incomeexpenses split evenly among 5 CDs, each with a 5year deposit term for the highest rate with evenly staggered maturity dates. In any given year, I could close one of these CDs to cover an emergency and lose only a few months of interest on just 20 of my emergency fund, instead of several years interest on all of it. If I needed more funds, I could withdraw more of the CDs as needed, in order of youngest deposit age to minimize the interest loss  although that loss would probably be the least of my worries by then, if Im dipping deeply into these funds Ill be needing them pretty badly. Initially I created the CDs with a very small amount and differing term lengths 1 year increments from 15 years and then as each matured, I rolled it back into a 5 year CD. Now every year when one matures, I add a little more principal to account for increased living expenses, and roll everything back in for another 5 years. Minimal thought and effort, no risk, much higher return than savings, fairly liquid accessible in an emergency, and great peace of mind. Plus it ensures I dont blow the money on something else, and that I have something to fall back on if all my other investments completely tanked, or I had massive medical bills, or lost my job, etc.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Small investing for spending money?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Margin when entered into a derivative contract,"The most obvious use of a collateral is as a risk buffer. Just as when you borrow money to buy a house and the bank uses the house as a collateral, so when people borrow money to loan financial instruments or as is more accurate, gain leverage the lender keeps a percentage of that or an equivalent instrument as a collateral. In the event that the borrower falls short of margin requirements, brokers in most cases have the right to sell that collateral and mitigate the risk. Derivatives contracts, like any other financial instrument, come with their risks. And depending on their nature they may sometimes be much more riskier than their underlying instruments. For example, while a common stocks main risk comes from the movements in its price which may itself result from many other macromicroeconomic factors, an option in that common stock faces risks from those factors plus the volatility of the stocks price. To cover this risk, lenders apply much higher haircuts when lending against these derivatives. In many cases, depending upon the notional exposure of the derivative, that actual dollar amount of the collateral may be more than the face value or the market value of the derivatives contract. Usually, this collateral is deposited not as the derivatives contract itself but rather as the underlying financial instrument an equity in case of an option, a bond in case of a CDS, and so on. This allows the lender to offset the risk by executing a trade on that collateral itself.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Margin when entered into a derivative contract?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Which dividend bearing stock should be chosen by price?,"Dont ever quantify a stocks preferenceperformance just based on the dividend it is paying out Volatility defined by movements in the the stocks price, affected by factors embedded in the stock e.g. the corporation, the business it is in, the economy, the management etc etc. Apple wasnt paying dividends but people were still buying into it.

What is the equation for an inflation adjusted annuity held in perpetuity?,"Let P denote the amount of the investment, R the rate of return and I the rate of inflation. For simplicity, assume that the payment p is made annually right after the return has been earned. Thus, at the end if the year, the investment P has increased to P1R and p is returned as the annuity payment. If I  0, the entire return can be paid out as the payment, and thus p  PR. That is, at the end of the year, when the dust settles after the return PR has been collected and paid out as the annuity payment, P is again available at the beginning of the next year to earn return at rate R. We have P1R  p  P If I  0, then at the end of the year, after the dust settles, we cannot afford to have only P available as the investment for next year. Next years payment must be p1I and so we need a larger investment since the rate of return is fixed. How much larger? Well, if the investment at the beginning of next year is P1I, it will earn exactly enough additional money to pay out the increased payment for next year, and have enough left over to help towards future increases in payments. Note that we are assuming that R  I. If R  I, a perpetuity cannot be created. Thus, suppose that we choose p such that P1R  p  P1I Multiplying this equation by 1I, we have [P1I]1R  [p1I]  P1I2 In words, at the start of next year, the investment is P1I and the return less the increased payout of p1I leaves an investment of P1I2 for the following year. Each year, the payment and the amount to be invested for the following year increase by a factor of 1I. Solving P1R  p  P1I for p, we get p  PRI as the initial perpetuity payment and the payment increases by a factor 1I each year. The initial investment is P and it also increases by a factor of 1I each year. In later years, the investment is P1In at the start of the year, the payment is p1In and the amount invested for the next year is P1In1.

Are stocks only listed with one exchange in one place?,"Depends. The short answer is yes HSBC, for instance, based in New York, is listed on both the LSE and NYSE. Toyotas listed on the TSE and NYSE. There are many ways to do this both of the above examples are the result of a corporation owning a subsidiary in a foreign country by the same name a holding company, which sells its own stock on the local market. The home corporation owns the majority holdings of the subsidiary, and issues its own stock on its ""home countrys"" exchange. It is also possible for the same company to list shares of the same ""pool"" of stock on two different exchanges the foreign exchange usually lists the stock in the corporations home currency and the share prices are nearidentical, or for a company to sell different portions of itself on different exchanges. However, these are much rarer for tax liability and other cost purposes its usually easier to keep American monies in America and Japanese monies in Japan by setting up two ""copies"" of yourself with one owning the other, and move money around between companies as necessary. Shares of one issue of one companys stock, on one exchange, are the same price regardless of where in the world you place a buy order from. However, that doesnt necessarily mean youll pay the same actual value of currency for the stock. First off, you buy the stock in the listed currency, which means buying dollars or Yen or Euros or GBP with both a fluctuating exchange rate between currencies and a brokers fee one of those cost savings that make it a good idea to charter subsidiaries could you imagine millions a day in car sales moving from American dealers to Toyota of Japan, converted from USD to Yen, with a FOREX commission to be paid?.

How to account for money earned and spent prior to establishing business bank accounts?,"Funds earned and spent before opening a dedicated business account should be classified according to their origination. For example, if your business received income, where did that money go? If you took the money personally, it would be considered either a distribution or a loan to you. It is up to you which of the two options you choose. On the flip side, if your business had an expense that you paid personally, that would be considered either a contribution of capital or a loan from you. If you choose to record these transactions as loans, you can offset them together, so you dont need two separate accounts, loan to you and loan from you. When the bank account was opened, the initial deposit came from where? If it came from your personal funds, then it is either a contribution of capital or a loan from you. From the sound of your question, you deposited what remained after the preceding incomeexpenses. This would, in effect, return the loan account back to zero, if choosing that route. The above would also be how to record any expenses you may pay personally for the business if any in the future. Because these transactions were not through a dedicated business bank account, you cant record them in Quickbooks as checks and deposits. Instead, you can use Journal Entries. For any income received, you would debit your capitalloan account and credit your income account. For any expenses, you would debit the appropriate expense account and credit your distributionloan account. Also, if setting up a loan account, you should choose either Current Asset or Current Liability type. The capital contribution and distribution account should be Equity type.

CFD market makers How is the price coupled to the underlying security?,"CFD providers typically offer CFDs to investors using either the direct market access DMA model or the market maker MM model. Direct Market Access The DMA model gives you access to trade the Underlying instrument on the relevant Exchange from which the CFD is then derived. All CFD Transactions under the DMA model have corresponding trades in the Underlying instrument. Under the DMA model, providers typically charge their clients Commission based on the notional contract value of the CFD. Market Maker The MM model uses the price of the Underlying instrument to derive the price of the CFD that is offered. Trading under the MM model does not necessarily mean that your CFD will be reflected by a corresponding trade in the Underlying instrument. Under the MM model each CFD Transaction creates a direct financial exposure for the provider, which may or may not be hedged in the Underlying instrument. Where the financial exposure is not hedged, the market risk may increase for the market maker. The MM model enables the provider to offer CFDs against synthetic assets, even if there is little Liquidity in the Underlying instrument, which can result in a wider range of products on offer than with the DMA model. Volatility and Illiquidity in the Underlying instrument can affect the pricing of MM CFDs. The MM model can charge its clients Commission based on the notional contract value or it can incorporate costs and fees in the dealing Spread, which represents the difference in price at which the issuer is prepared to Buy and Sell the CFD. What Do I use and why? I have traded with both DMA and MM models and prefer the MM. The big advantage with MM is that they will provide a market even when the underlying is very illiquid and only might have a few trades each day. Regarding the spread of the MM to the spread of the underlying, I have found the MM to be practically in line with the underlying spread about 95 of the time. The other 5 it may have been slightly wider than the spread of the underlying by usually 1c or 2c. Most MMs aim to give you the best spread they can because they want to keep your business. If they gave too wide a spread compared to the underlying it wouldnt be long before they had no customers.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: CFD market makers How is the price coupled to the underlying security?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is a stock warrant?

The other big difference between options and warrants is that options are standardized. Any call or put you buy on a particular exchange has basically the same set of rules governing use. By contrast, a warrant may have all kinds of stipulations that must occur before you can execute, such as price events e.g. only if the stock hits a certain price or business events e.g. only if the company elects to defer payment on a bond issued at the same time as the warrant.

Closed end funds trade a lot like securities, since the fund is closed, you have to buy shares from another owner that is selling just like with stocks, that means the shares can sometimes trade above or below the underlying value of the actual assets held by the fund depending on buyingselling pressure and the relative liquidity of a given fund.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What ETF or other security tracks closest to 30 year mortgage rates?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"If you want to trade an equity that reflects changes in VIX, what is a good proxy for it?","There is no good proxy for VIX, because it is a completely madeup value. Most listed options trade on an underlying security. I can therefore choose to buy either the stock, or a future or option on that stock. In this way, the future and option are derivatives in that they derive their value in part based on something else, in this case the stock price as of now. VIX is a different entity altogether. It is based on the volatility of the market, using ""market expectation of near term volatility conveyed by stock index option prices"". But the FAQ goes on to state that they are adding factors into the formula. So right away there is no one equitystock that you can hold that will necessarily match the VIX in any significant way, because it is not directly based on stocks, but indirectly through other options and computations. In effect, therefore, the VIX in indeed only available through its options, and is not observable tradable in and of itself.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If you want to trade an equity that reflects changes in VIX, what is a good proxy for it?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"What economic, political and other factors influence mortgage rates and how?","If you owned a bank how would you invest the banks money? Typically banks are involved in loaning out money to businesses, people, and government at a higher interest rate then what they are paying to depositors. This is the spread and how they make money. If the bank determines that the yields on government bonds is more attractive then loaning the money out to businesses and people then the bank will purchase government bonds. It can also decide the other way. In this manner the mortgage and bond markets are always competing for capital and tend to offer very similar yields. Certain banks have the unique privilege of being able to borrow money from the FED at the Federal Funds rate and use this money to purchase government debt or loan it out to other banks or purchase other debt products. In this manner you see a high correlation between the FED funds rate, mortgage rates, and treasury yields. Other political factors include legislation that encourages mortgage lending see Community Reinvestment Act where banks may not have made the loans without said legislation. In short, keep your eye on the FED and ask yourself ""Does the FED want rates to rise?"" and ""Can the US government afford rising rates?"" The answer to these two questions is no. However, the FED may be pressured to ""stop the presses"" if inflation becomes unwieldy and the FED actually starts to care about food and energy prices.

How can I avoid international wire fees or currency transfer fees?,"I did some empirical research, comparing the exchange rates for wire transfers vs. the exchange rates for ATM withdrawals.

As far as I can see, Tors answer above has it completely backwards, at least with my bank, ATM withdrawals are a much better value. Do the research yourself...call the bank youre going to transfer from and find out what their current exchange rate is. Compare it to the current spot rate e.g. XE.com to determine how much of a cut the bank is taking. Then, if you can, withdraw some cash from the foreign location with your ATM card and see how much of the original currency is deducted from your account.

Why doesnt Japan just divide the Yen by 100? ,"Currently, there is simply no reason to do so. Its not a problem. It is no more of a problem or effort to denote ""5,000"" than it is to denote ""50.00"". But if there were a reason to do so, it wouldnt be all that difficult. Of course there would be some minor complications because some people mostly old people presumably would take time getting used to it, but nothing that would stop a nation from doing so. In Iceland, this has happened on several occasions in the past and while Iceland is indeed a very small economy, it shouldnt be that difficult at all for a larger one. A country would need a grace period while the old currency is still valid, new editions of already circulating cash would need to be produced, and a coordinated time would need to be set, at which point financial institutions change their balances. Of course it would take some planning and coordination, but nothing close to for example unifying two or more currencies into one, like the did with the euro. The biggest sideeffect there was an inflation shot when the currencies got changed in each country, but this can be done even with giant economies like Germany and France. Cutting off two zeros would be a cakewalk in comparison. But in case of currencies like the Japanese Yen, there is simply no reason to take off 2 zeros yet. NorthernAmericans may find it strange that the numbers are so high, but thats merely a matter of what youre used to. There is no added complication in paying 5.000 vs. 50 at a restaurant, it merely takes more space on a computer screen and bill, and thats not a real problem. Besides, most of the time, even in NAmerica, the cents are listed as well, and that doesnt seem to be enough of a problem for people to concern themselves with.

Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?,"The reason its broken out is very specific this is showing you how much interest accrued during the month. It is the only place thats shown, typically. Each months minimum payment is the sum of [the interest accrued during that month] and [some principal], say MIP, and B is your total loan balance. That I is fixed at the amount of interest that accrued that month  you always must pay off the accrued interest. It changes each month as some of the principal is reduced if you have a 3 daily interest rate, you owe 0.03B31 approximately plus a bit as the interest on the interest accrues each month or 30 or 28. Since B is going down constantly as principal is paid off, I is also going down. The P is most commonly calculated based on an amortization table, such that you have a fixed payment amount each month and pay the loan off after a certain period of time. Thats why P changes each month  because its easier for people to have a constant monthly payment M, than to have a fixed P and variable I for a variable M. As such, its important to show you the I amount, both so you can verify that the loan is being correctly chargedpaid, and for your tax purposes.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Wife sent to collections for ticket she paid ten years ago,"I had this happen to me with parking ticket when I was still in school. The tickets were issued by the school police and later dismissed because I had purchased a yearlong parking pass. 3 years later I got a letter alleging that I had unpaid parking ticket. So they lost the record of dismissal. But they did not lose the record of having issued the ticket. I am fairly certain this happens because legal entities either lose electronic records and restore data from backups without realizing that some corrupted data remains lost or because they transition to a new system and certain realworld events dont get transferred properly to the new system. Of course, the people with whom you end up interacting at that point have no idea of any potential technical problems because they may occur only in some technical oneoff cases. In my case, I was able to show that I had received a judgement of dismissal. I actually kept the paperwork. The question is what do you do if you lost the records and the state had lost all electronic records of your payments. Lets assume the collections agency has a record produced by the state that you owed the ticket amount, but the state claims that no record exists of you having paid the tickets. What do you do, then? Carefully compile the list of all possible banks which you could have possibly used. Then request duplicate statements from all the banks which you have on that list. Assuming you were a regular consumer and not running a business, this should not amount to more than 100 pages or so. If you do manage to find the transactions in those bank records, you are in luck. States, unlike the federal government, are not immune from law suits. So you can consult a lawyer. By fraudulently claiming that you defaulted on payments, the state caused you material harm by lowering your credit rating and increasing your cost of borrowing. Once you have all the paperwork in hand, you still will have difficult time finding anyone in the state to listen to you. And even if you do, you will not be compensated for the time and expenses you expanded to obtain these records. If you indeed paid the tickets, then you are being asked to prove your innocence and you are assumed guilty until you do.

Why does the calculation for percentage profit vary based on whether a position is short vs. long?,"There are different perspectives from which to calculate the gain, but the way I think it should be done is with respect to the risk youve assumed in the original position, which the simplistic calculation doesnt factor in. Theres a good explanation about calculating the return from a short sale at Investopedia. Heres the part that I consider most relevant [...] When calculating the return of a short sale, you need to compare the amount the trader gets to keep to the initial amount of the liability. Had the trade in our example turned against you, you as the short seller would owe not only the initial proceeds amount but also the excess amount, and this would come out of your pocket. [...] Refer to the source link for the full explanation. Update As you can see from the other answers and comments, it is a more complex a QA than it may first appear. I subsequently found this interesting paper which discusses the difficulty of rate of return with respect to short sales and other atypical trades Excerpt [...] The problem causing this almost uniform omission of a percentage return on short sales, options especially writing, and futures, it may be speculated, is that the nighwell universal and conventional definition of rate of return involving an initial cash outflow followed by a later cash inflow does not appear to fit these investment situations. None of the investment finance texts nor general finance texts, undergraduate or graduate, have formally or explicitly shown how to resolve this predicament or how to justify the calculations they actually use.

Paying extra on a mortgage. How much can I save? [duplicate],"If youre truly ready to pay an extra 1000 every month, and are confident youll likely always be able to, you should refinance to a 15 year mortgage. 15 year mortgages are typically sold at around a half a point lower interest rates, meaning that instead of your 4.375 APR, youll get something like 3.875 APR. Thats a lot of money over the course of the mortgage. Youll end up paying around a thousand a month more  so, exactly what youre thinking of doing  and not only save money from that earlier payment, but also have a lower interest rate. That 0.5 means something like 25k less over the life of the mortgage. Its also the difference in about 130 or so a month in your required payment. Now of course youll be locked into making that larger payment  so the difference between what youre suggesting and this is that youre paying an extra 25k in exchange for the ability to pay it off more slowly in which case youd also pay more interest, obviously, but in the best case scenario. In the 15 year scenario you must make those 4000 payments. In the 30 year scenario you can pay 2900 for a while if you lose your job or want to go on vacation or ... whatever. Of course, the reverse is also true youll have to make the payments, so you will. Many people find enforced savings to be a good strategy myself among them I have a 15 year mortgage and am happy that I have to make the higher payment, because it means I cant spend that extra money frivolously.

Why is economic growth so important? ,"Wealth is not distributed equally in any economy. And, even if it were, differentiation between people would lead to different interests being expressed in different ways. As people either attempt to earn more to improve their situation or different people express those interests in different ways saving money to go on a skiing holiday, or to put a downpayment on a house people invite new products and services to be created to satisfy those demands. In addition, there is the problem of uncertainty. People save money today to cope with uncertainty tomorrow healthcare, pensions, education, etc.. Those savings dont remain idle, but are lent to others who believe that they can make a return through investing in new businesses or ideas. The point being that any dynamic economy will experience change in the amount of goods available to the people within that economy. From an economic perspective ""growth"" is just another permutation. From a political perspective, ""growth"" implies that people are getting wealthier. If that growth is asymmetrically distributed e.g. the poor dont experience it and the middle classes dont feel they get enough of it then that is a problem for politicians. The emerging markets of the world are trying to raise millions of people out of poverty. Growth is a way of measuring how quickly they are achieving that end. Growth, in and of itself, is meaningless. There are some people who believe that ""we"" as some proxy of society have enough stuff and growth is unnecessary but that implies that everyone is satisfied.

How can one identify institutional accumulation of a particular stock using price and volume data?,"A couple ways, but its not a guarantee. You have to have special charts. Instead of each tick being 1 min, 5 min, or whatever, it is a set number of trades. Say 2000. Since retail investors only buy and sell in small amounts, there will be small volume per tick. An institutional investor, however, would have a much much higher trade lot size, even if using an algo. Thus, large volume spikes in such a chart would signal institutional activity over retail. Similarly, daily charts showing average trade size can help you pick out when institutional activity is highest, as they have much larger trade sizes. You could also learn how the algos work and look for evidence one is being used. ie every time price hits VWAP a large sell order goes through would indicate an institutional investor is selling, especially if it happens multiple times in a row.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can one identify institutional accumulation of a particular stock using price and volume data?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Currently sole owner of a property. My girlfriend is looking to move in with me and is offering to pay rent. Am I at risk here?,"The rent payment is in principle taxable. However, you should be able to take advantage of the ""rent a room"" scheme, and the proposed rent falls well under the 7,500year tax threshold for that. So no tax will be actually payable and you dont have to formally declare it as long as you stay below that threshold. You should also be fairly well legally protected in case you do split up in future and you want to remove her. As you would be living there too, she would just be a lodger, not a tenant technically, an ""excluded occupier"". If you did want her to leave you would only need to give reasonable notice and wouldnt need a formal court order if you needed to force her to go. As JBentley points out, there have been court cases where domestic partners contributing to household expenses while the other partner paid the mortgage have later been able to claim that this implied joint ownership. This was on the basis of a ""constructive trust"" being implicitly setup by the way they arranged their finances. In your case, if theres a clear intention, formalised in writing, for the money to be treated as rent rather than a contribution towards purchasing the property, I think it should make it very hard to claim the contrary later. I would also suggest you be clear about whether the rent includes a share of the utility bills, and that things like groceries would be handled separately and split 5050 or whatever. As pointed out in a comment, there are template agreements for lodgers you could use a starting point e.g. this one, but its likely youd need to customise it to your circumstances. Another point made in another answer is that theres potential upcoming legislation to give some rights to cohabiting partners. In the current draft, those would kick in after three years or having children. If the bill does come into effect, youd also be able to sign an opt out, but only after getting legal advice, and it would still be possible though presumably hard to persuade a court to overturn an opt out. Overall that does create a small risk to you, but not one that comes directly from your girlfriend paying rent. Its likely that if you are both on an equal financial footing and had always kept your finances separate, that there wouldnt be any award made anyway.

How do I adjust to a new social class?,Under what conditions did you move? My favourite method of judging prices objectively comes from concepts written in Your Money or Your Life by Joe Dominguez.

How can you possibly lose on investments in stocks?,"Some stocks do fall to zero. I dont have statistics handy, but Id guess that a majority of all the companies ever started are now bankrupt and worth zero. Even if a company does not go bankrupt, there is no guarantee that its value will increase forever, even in a general, overall sense. You might buy a stock when it is at or near its peak, and then it loses value and never regains it. Even if a stock will go back up, you cant know for certain that it will. Suppose you bought a stock for 10 and its now at 5. If you sell, you lose half your money. But if you hold on, it MIGHT go back up and you make a profit. Or it might continue going down and you lose even more, perhaps your entire investment. A rational person might decide to sell now and cut his losses. Of course, Im sure many investors have had the experience of selling a stock at a loss, and then seeing the price skyrocket. But there have also been plenty of investors who decided to hold on, only to lose more money. Just a couple of weeks ago a stock I bought for 1.50 was selling for 14. I could have sold for like 900 profit. Instead I decided to hold on and see if it went yet higher. Its now at 2.50. Fortunately I only invested something like 800. If it goes to zero it will be annoying but not ruin me. On a bigger scale, if you invest in a variety of stocks and hold on to them for a long period of time, the chance that you will lose money is small. The stock market as a whole has consistently gone up in the long term. But the chance is not zero. And a key phrase is ""in the long term"". If you need the money today, the fact that the market will probably go back up within a few months or a year or so may not help.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can you possibly lose on investments in stocks?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Using simple moving average in Equity,"One of the most obvious uses of SMAs is the detection of a trend reversal. A trend reversal happens when a short term SMA crosses over a longer term SMA. For example, if a 20 day moving average was, previously, above a 200 day moving average, but has crossed over the 200 day and is currently below the 200 day then the security has performed a death cross and the trend is for lower and lower prices.

Can a dividend reinvestment plan DRIP and share purchase plan SPP be used with a TFSA?,"You can hold a wide variety of investments in your TFSA account, including stocks such as SLF. But if the stocks are being purchased via a company stock purchase plan, they are typically deposited in a regular margin account with a brokerage firm a few companies may issue physical stock certificates but that is very rare these days. That account would not be a TFSA but you can perform whats called an ""inkind"" transfer to move them into a TFSA that you open with either the same brokerage firm, or a different one. There will be a fee for the transfer  check with the brokerage that currently holds the stock to find out how costly that will be. Assuming the stock gained in value while you held it outside the TFSA, this transfer will result in capital gains tax that youll have to pay when you file your taxes for the year in which the transfer occurs. The tax would be calculated by taking the value at time of transfer, minus the purchase price or the market value at time of purchase, if your plan allowed you to buy it at a discounted price the discounted amount will be automatically taxed by your employer. 50 of the capital gain is added to your annual income when calculating taxes owed. Normally when you sell a stock that has lost value, you can actually get a ""capital loss"" deduction that is used to offset gains that you made in other stocks, or redeemed against capital gains tax paid in previous years, or carried forward to apply against gains in future years. However, if the stock decreased in value and you transfer it, you are not eligible to claim a capital loss. Im not sure why you said ""TFSA for a family member"", as you cannot directly contribute to someone elses TFSA account. You can give them a gift of money or stocks, which they can deposit in their TFSA account, but that involves that extra step of gifting, and the moneystocks become their property to do with as they please. Now that Ive hopefully answered all your questions, let me offer you some advice, as someone who also participates in an employee stock purchase plan. Holding stock in the company that you work for is a bad idea. The reason is simple if something terrible happens to the company, their stock will plummet and at the same time they may be forced to lay off many employees. So just at the time when you lose your job and might want to sell your stock, suddenly the value of your stocks has gone way down! So you really should sell your company shares at least once a year, and then use that money to invest in your TFSA account. You also dont want to put all your eggs in one basket  you should be spreading your investment among many companies, or better yet, buy index mutual funds or ETFs which hold all the companies in a certain index. Theres lots of good info about index investing available at Canadian Couch Potato.

When to buy and sell bonds,"Why does selling a bond drive up the yield? The bond will pay back a fixed amount when it comes due. The yield is a comparison of what you pay for the bond and what will be repaid when it matures assuming no default. Why does the yield go up if the country is economically unstable? If the countrys economy is unstable, that increases the chance that they will default and not pay the full value of the bonds when they mature. People are selling them now at a loss instead of waiting for a default later for a greater loss. So if you think Greece is not going to default as its highly likely a country would completely default, wouldnt it make sense to hold onto the bonds? Only if you also think that they will pay back the full value at maturity. Its possible that they pay some, but not all. Its also possible that they will default. Its also possible that they will get kicked out of the Euro and start printing Drachmas again, and try to pay the bonds back with those which could devalue the bonds through inflation. The market is made of lots of smart people. If they think there are reasons to worry, there probably are. That doesnt mean they can predict the future, it just means that they are pricing the risk with good information.

Many asset management companies have funds that are either passive track index or moreorless closely adhere to a benchmark, with the benchmark frequently being based onexactly an index. As such, a stock thats part of an index would be heavily owned by institutional investors. Conclusion Nothing definitive. Being included in an equity index is usually dependent on the market cap NOT on intrinsic quality of the company, its fundamentals or stock returns. The company is considered a good prospect growth or value, in a sector that is popular with institutional investors. Theres a certain amount of groupthink in investing.

You dont know if the price at which those institutional companies bought the stock is way lower than now. You dont know if the stock is held for its returns potential, or as part of an index, or some fancy strategy you as individual investor cant follow.

Somewhat similar in spirit to 2, except this time, its algorithmic trading making decisions based on technicals instead of portfolio managers based on funamentals. Obviously, same conclusion applies, even more so. The company sold a large part of the stock directly to institutional investor as part of an offering.

Any reason to keep IRAs separate?,"Once upon a time, money rolled over from a 401k or 403b plan into an IRA could not be rolled into another 401k or 403b unless the IRA account was properly titled as a Rollover IRA instead of Traditional IRA  Roth IRAs were still in the future and the money kept separate not commingled with contributions to Traditional IRAs. Much of that has fallen by the way side as the rules have become more relaxed. Also the desire to roll over money into a 401k plan at ones new job has decreased too  far too many employersponsored retirement plans have large management fees and the investments are rarely the best available one can generally do better keeping ex401k money outside a new 401k, though of course new contributions from salary earned at the new employer perforce must be put into the employers 401k. While consolidating ones IRA accounts at one brokerage or one fund family certainly saves on the paperwork, it is worth keeping in mind that putting all ones eggs in one basket might not be the best idea, especially for those concerned that an employee might, like Matilda, take me money and run Venezuela. Another issue is that while one may have diversified investments at the brokerage or fund family, the entire IRA must have the same set of beneficiaries one cannot leave the money invested in GM stock or Fund A to one person and the money invested in Ford stock or Fund B to another if one so desires. Thinking far ahead into the future, if one is interested in making charitable bequests, it is the best strategy taxwise to make these bequests from taxdeferred monies rather than from posttax money.

Banks have to discount the value of loans to take into account the likelihood of the loan not being repaid. They classify certain loans as riskier than others, and these are discounted more heavily.

Can a high downpayment on a house offset the need for proof of income?,"Its difficult to provide an exact answer as this will very much depend on the bank  the local regulatory scheme. However as a business owner you should be able to provide incorporation docs, some proof of ownership of the company and last years financial statements or tax returns, many banks would accept this as a proof of income for the purposes of granting credit. In general in most jurisdictions I can think of, a high downpayment will not remove the need to verify income as the bank needs to feel comfortable that you have the ability to pay the remaining 25 e.g. how do they know youre not a serially unemployed lottery winner and if the downpayment is quite large they may want some assurance that you got the money legally e.g. how do they make sure youre not a drug dealer. So probably regardless of how large a downpayment most banks would probably want some additional proofs of income however what proofs are needed may be more flexible than just a salary stub. I suggest taking a look at what sort of documents you may have on hand that can serve to validate your revenue in some way and contacting a few banks directly to see what options they can provide and whether some customtailored arrangement can be made.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can a high downpayment on a house offset the need for proof of income?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Are BIC and SWIFT code the same things?,"IBAN  is International Bank Account Number. The number is constructed in such a way that it uniquely identifies your account in the world.

"How can riskreward relationship exist, since the losses due to the risk should offset the reward?","In an ""efficient"" investment market the amount of risk premium would EXACTLY offset the likelihood of loss, such that over long time frames the expected return on investment would be equal for all investment options. In practice, we usually see that riskier investments yield a higher longterm return because the risk premium is larger than that ""efficient"" amount. This is because many investors dont have a longterm time horizon, and the pain of loss is greater than the reward of gain ""asymmetric preferences"". Its also important to think about the riskreward interaction as being PERCEIVED risk to EXPECTED reward.

Doubleentry accounting how to keep track of mortgage installments as expenses?,"Understandably, it appears as if one must construct the flows oneself because of the work involved to include every loan variation. First, it would be best to distinguish between cash and accrued, otherwise known as the economic, costs. The cash cost is, as youve identified, the payment. This is a reality for cash management, and its wise that you wish to track it. However, by accruals, the only economic cost involved in the payment is the interest. The reason is because the rest of the payment flows from one form of asset to another, so if out of a 1,000 payment, 100 is principal repayment, you have merely traded 100 of cash for 100 of house. The cash costs will be accounted for on the cash flow statement while the accrued or economic costs will be accounted on the income statement. It appears as if youve accounted for this properly. However, for the resolution that you desire, the accounts must first flow through the income statement followed next instead of directly from assets to liabilities. This is where you can get a sense of the true costs of the home. To get better accrual resolution, credit cash and debit mortgage interest expense  principal repayment. Book the mortgage interest expense on the income statement and then cancel the principal repayment account with the loan account. The principal repayment should not be treated as an expense however, the cash payment that pays down the mortgage balance should be booked so that it will appear on the cash flow statement. Because you werent doing this before, and you were debiting the entire payment off of the loan, you should probably notice your booked loan account diverging from the actual. This proper booking will resolve that. When you are comfortable with booking the payments, you can book unrealized gains and losses by marking the house to market in this statement to get a better understanding of your financial position. The cash flow statement with proper bookings should show how the cash has flowed, so if it is according to standards, household operations should show a positive flow from laborinvestments less the amount of interest expense while financing will show a negative flow from principal repayment. Investing due to the home should show no change due to mortgage payments because the house has already been acquired, thus there was a large outflow when cash was paid to acquire the home. The program should give some way to classify accounts so that they are either operational, investing, or financing. All income  expenses are operational. All investments such as equities, credit assets, and the home are investing. All liabilities are financing. To book the installment payment X which consists of Y in interest and Z in principal To resolve the reduction in principal As long as the accounts are properly classified, GnuCash probably does the rest for you, but if not, to resolve the expense Finally, net income is resolved My guess is that GnuCash derives the cash flow statement indirectly, but you can do the entry by simply In this case, it happily resembles the first accrued entry, but with cash, thats all that is necessary by the direct method.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Doubleentry accounting how to keep track of mortgage installments as expenses?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Split buying a house 3 ways. How do I approach this?,"I would second the advice to not do this. Real estate ownership is complex to begin with, involving a constant stream of maintenance, financing, and other decisions. It is difficult enough to do for a single individual or a family as a unit a couple, but at least spouses are forced to compromise. Friends are not, and you can end up with longrunning conflicts and impasses. Financial transactions of any kind impose tensions on relationships, and friendships are no exception. If you want your friendship to survivie, do not sacrifice it to the financial arrangement which seems like a good idea at the moment. My advice would be to steer clear, no matter how attractive on the surface the deal might look. Focus on your own individual finances and use discipline and patience to save the amount needed for acquiring a separate investment property. But it will be 100 yours, and will save tons of headache. Since you are still considering this deal, its a great time to politely change your mind and walk away  believe me, a few minutes of inconvenience will save you years of frustration.

Are there any issues with registering an LLC in a foreign state?,This is an older question but I thought Id give the correct response for anyone else that might look. Yes there definitely could be issues. You can form in friendly states such as Delaware and Nevada without having a physical location in the state but you cant run a business from another state without having to qualify to do business in that State. To give a bit more clarification. Lets say you open a Delaware LLC. But you answer the phone when it rings on your New York phone and money comes into your New York bank account and your suppliers and vendors all use your New York address to send invoices and correspondence. Well you can pretty much count that you fall into the definition of doing business in New York and expected to pay New York taxes and qualify to do business in the state.

Regarding Australian CBS takeover of TEN,"they are purchasing the company"" is this correct? Yes this is correct. If I purchase a ""company"" here in Australia, I also purchase its assets and liabilities Yes that is correct. How can it be NIL? How can it be legal? The value of shares [or shareholders] is Assets  liabilities. Generally a healthy company has Assets that are greater than its liabilities and hence the company has value and shareholders have value of the shares. In case of TEN the company has more liabilities even after all assets are sold off there is not enough money left out to pay all the creditors. Hence the company is in Administration. i.e. it is now being managed by Regulated Australian authority. The job of the administrator is to find out suitable buyers so that most of the creditors are paid off and if there is surplus pay off the shareholder or arrive at a suitable deal. In case of TEN the liabilities are so large that no one is ready to buy the company and the deal of CBS will also mean nothing gets paid to existing shareholders as the value is negative [as the company is separate legal entity, they cant recover the negative from shareholders].

What is a trade exchange and are they reputable or not?,"I think this is off topic, but here is a stab So these are cashless. It could be a way to smooth out the harsh reality of capitalism I overproduced my product, I have more capacity than I can sell and I can trade those good to other capitalists who similarly poorly planned production or capacity. Therefore the market for a system like is limited to businesses that do not plan well. Business that plan production or capacity to levels they can already sell for cash do not need a private system to offload goods. Alternatives to such a system include I dont know how many businesses are really in this over production  over capacity state. If my assumption that it isnt many is wrong, my answer is garbage. This is a bartering system with a brokerage. I think we have historically found that common currencies create more trade and economic activity because the value of the note in your pocket, which is the same type of note in my pocket, is common and understood. Exchange rates typically slow down trade. There are many other reasons to have different currency or notes on a global sale, but the exchange certainly is a hurdle to clear. This brokerage is essentially adding a new currency in a grand metaphor. And that new currency is only spendable on their brokerage, which is of limited use to society as a whole, assuming that society as a whole isnt a participating member of that brokerage. I cant really think of why this type of exchange is better than the current system we have now.

Does negative PE ratio mean stock is weak?,"PE is the number of years it would take for the company to earn its share price. You take share price divided by annual earnings per share. You can take the current reported quarterly earnings per share times 4, you can take the sum of the past four actual quarters earnings per share or you can take some projected earnings per share. It has little to do with a companys actual finances apart from the earnings per share. It doesnt say much about the health of a companys balance sheet, and is definitely not an indicator for bankruptcy. Its mostly a measure of the markets assumptions of the companys ability to grow earnings or maintain its current earnings growth. A share price of 40 trading for a PE ratio of 10 means it will take the company 10 years to earn 40 per share, it means theres current annual earnings per share of 4. A different company may also be earning 4 per share but trade at 100 times earnings for a share price of 400. By this measure alone neither company is more or less healthy than the other. One just commands more faith in the future growth from the market. To circle back to your question regarding a negative PE, a negative PE ratio means the company is reporting negative earnings running at a loss. Again, this may or may not indicate an imminent bankruptcy. Increasing balance sheet debt with decreasing revenue and or earnings and or balance sheet assets will be a better way to assess bankruptcy risk.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Does negative PE ratio mean stock is weak?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations?,"JohnFX and TTT provide excellent answers. Researching prices others have paid, being up front that youll go buy a junker car to hold you over if they wont meet your price, and playing a few dealerships off of each other are all great tactics. In addition, Ive got a few points about timing your purchase. If youre not desperate for a car, these can really help give you the upper hand in negotiations Wait until the end of the month. Dealerships and individual salespeople usually have quotas that theyre trying to clear, and the month is usually the standard cutoff. The last time I bought a car, the salesman made the mistake of mentioning, ""I dont usually work Thursdays, but Ill be in this Thursday."" Thursday was the 31st  I inferred from this information that he hadnt made his quota for the month yet. So I came back on the 31st to negotiate, and managed to hammer out a pretty good deal. Wait until about an hour before the dealership closes to show up and shop. This gives you enough time to not be obvious about the tactic, but youll definitely be holding them past their normal quitting time if you do much negotiating. The salesman will be a little more inclined to make a deal so he can get home and have dinner.

Would I ever need credit card if my debit card is issued by MasterCardVisa?,"The credit card may have advantages in at least two cases In some instances at least in the US, a merchant will put a ""hold"" on a credit card without charging it. This happens a lot at hotels, for example, which use the hold as collateral against damages and incidental charges. On a credit card this temporarily reduces your credit limit but never appears on your bill. Ive never tried to do it on a debit card, but my understanding is that they either reject the debit card for this purpose or they actually make the withdrawal and then issue a refund later. Youll actually need to account for this in your cash flow on the debit card but not on the credit card. If you get a fraudulent charge on your credit card, it impacts that account until you detect it and go through the fraud resolution process. On a debit card, the fraudulent charge may ripple through the rest of your life. The rent payment that you made by electronic transfer or in the US by check, for example, is now rejected because your bank account is short by the amount of the fraud even if you didnt use the debit card to pay it. Eventually this will probably get sorted out, but it has potential to create a bigger mess than is necessary. Personally, I never use my debit card.

What is a convertible note?,"Source, see if you have access to it Convertible notes are often used by angel investors who wish to fund businesses without establishing an explicit valuation of the company in which they are investing. When an investor purchases equity in a startup, the purchase price of the equity implies a company valuation. For example, if an investor purchases a 10 per cent ownership stake in a company, and pay 1m for that stake, this implies that the company is worth 10m. Some early stage investors may wish to avoid placing a value on the company in this way, because this in turn will affect the terms under which laterstage investors will invest in the company. Convertible notes are structured as loans at the time the investment is made. The outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity when a later equity investor appears, under terms that are governed by the terms set by the laterstage equity investor. An equity investor is someone who purchases equity in a company. Example Suppose an angel investor invests 100,000 using a convertible note. Later, an equity investor invests 1m and receives 10 of the companys shares. In the simplest possible case, the initial angel investors convertible note would convert to 110th of the equity investors claim. Depending on the exact structure of the convertible note, however, the angel investor may also receive extra shares to compensate them for the additional risk associated with being an earlier investor The worstcase scenario would be if the issuing company initially performed well, meaning that the debt would be converted into shares, and subsequently went bankrupt. The converted shares would become worthless, but the holder of the note would no longer have any recourse. Will twitter have to sell their offices and liquidate staff to close this debt? This depends on the senioritypriority of the debt. Debt is serviced according to seniority. The higher seniority debts will be paid off first and then only the lower seniority debts be serviced. This will all be in the agreements when you enter into a transaction.

Why is everyone saying how desperately we need to save money in this economy?,"I would add to the other excellent answers that another factor besides just high unemployment numbers is the fear people have regarding the ""financial"" aspects of the country, that is the value of stocks and the value of the dollar. When the economy is sluggish it means people arent buying enough, therefore companies arent making enough, therefore their profits are too low and people start to divest from them, and stock prices drop. Or even the fear of this happening can induce people to sell off shares. The point is, people are worried ""in this economy"" because ifdue to unemployment, low spendingconsumer confidencethe stock market crashes again as it did in 200809, that represents a lot of savings lost, e.g. 4050 of what one was counting on to retire with, particularly if you panic sell at the bottom. Now suddenly its as if you had a huge robbery, and you will have to work longer into your retirement years than youd planned. Similarly, if, due to monetary policy, the U.S. inflates the dollar, what one saved for retirement may not be sufficient. These arguments are true for shorter periods than just ones retirement, but just taking that as an example. So its not just unemployment that is worrisome ""in this economy"".

What can my relatives do to minimize their out of pocket expenses on their fathers estate,"Sure, its irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate. But what about passivity or inaction? Put it another way. Is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate? Think about it  what a silly idea!

With only 712 tenants, the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit. Is that acceptable? Heck no!

Renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants  12,000year on a 1000mo. rental. And that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates. But on an old mortgage, renting is like printing money. That money propagates first to the estate presumably it is holding back a ""fix the roof"" emergency fund, and then to the beneficiaries. It means getting annual checks from the estate, instead of constantly being dunned for another repair. But I dont care about making revenue outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof. Even if it was net zero, it means the maintenance is being done. This being the point. It is keeping the house in good repair, occupied, insured, and professionally managed  fit and ready for the bequests purpose occupancy of an aunt. Whats the alternative? Move an aunt into a house thats been 10 years abandoned? Realistically the heirs are going to get tiredbored of maintaining the place at a total cash loss, maintenance will slip, and youll be moving them into a neglected house with some serious issues. That betrays the bequest, and its not fair to the aunts. Rental is a very responsible thing to do. The executor shouldnt fail to do it merely out of passivity. If you decide not to do it, there needs to be a viable alternative to funding the homes decent upkeep. I dont think there is one.

How to sell a stock in a crashing market?,"Assuming you are referring to macro corrections and crashes as opposed to technical crashes like the ""flash crash""  It is certainly possible to sell stocks during a market drop  by definition, the market is dropping not only because there are a larger number of sellers, but more importantly because there are a large number of transactions that are driving prices down. In fact, volumes are strongly correlated with volatility, so volumes are actually higher when the market is going down dramatically  you can verify this on Yahoo or Google Finance pick a liquid stock like SPY and look at 2008 vs recent years. That doesnt say anything about the kind of selling that occurs though. With respect to your question ""Whats the best strategy for selling stocks during a drop?"", it really depends on your objective. You can generally always sell at some price. That price will be worse during market crashes. Beyond the obvious fact that prices are declining, spreads in the market will be wider due to heightened volatility. Many people are forced to sell during crashes due to external and  or psychological pressures  and sometimes selling is the right thing to do  but the best strategy for longterm investors is often to just hold on.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How to sell a stock in a crashing market?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What differentiates index funds and ETFs?,"Im assuming the question is about how to compare two ETFs that track the same index. Id look at for ETFs  ignoring index funds So, for example you might compare SPY vs IVV SPY has about 100x the volume. Sure, IVV has 2M shares trading, so it is liquid ""enough"". But the bigger volume on SPY might matter to you if you use options open interest is as much as 1000x more on SPY. Even if you have no interest in options, the spreads on SPY are probably going to be slightly smaller. They both have 0.09 expense ratios. When I looked on 201096, SPY was trading at a slight discount, IVV was at a slight premium. Looking for any sort of trend is left as an exercise to the reader... Grab the prospectus for each to examine the rules they set for fund makeup. Both come from wellknown issuers and have a decent history. Rather than crazy Uncle Eds pawn shop, or the Central Bank of Stilumunistan. So unless you find something in the SPY prospectus that makes you queasy, the higher volume and equal expense ratios would seem to suggest it over IVV.

Relative worth of investment versus spending for the economy ,"I believe youre looking for some sort of formula that will determine how changes in savings, investing, and spending will affect economic growth. If such a formula existed and worked then central planning would work since a couple of people could pull some levers to encourage more savings, or more investing, or more spending  depending on what was needed at that particular time. Unfortunately, no magic formula exists and so no person has enough knowledge to determine what the proper amount of savings, investing, or spending should be at a given time.

How to deal with the credit card debt from family member that has passed away?,"First, when a debt collector says, ""Its to your advantage to give me money now"", Id take that with a grain of salt. My exwife declared bankruptcy and when debt collectors couldnt find her, they somehow tracked me down and told me that I should tell her that it would be to her advantage to pay off this debt before the bankruptcy went through. That was total nonsense of course. The whole point of bankruptcy is to not have to pay the debt. Why would you pay it just before it was wiped off the books? Now that I think of it, Im surprised that they didnt tell me that I should pay her debts. As others have noted, this would be controlled by state law. But in general, when someone dies any debts are payed from the assets of the estate, and then whatever is left goes to the heirs. If nothing is left or the debts exceed the assets, then the heirs get nothing, but they dont have to pay somebody elses debts. I dont see how you could ""put the house under your name"". If he left the house to you in his will, then after any debts are settled in accordance with state law, the house would transfer to you. But you cant just decide to put the house in your name outside of the legal inheritance process. If you could, then people could undermine a will at any time by just deciding to take an asset left to someone else and ""put it in their name"". Or as in this case, people could undermine the rights of creditors by transferring all assets to themselves before debts were paid. Even if theres some provision in your state for changing the name on a deed prior to probate to facilitate getting mortgages and taxes paid or whatever, I would be quite surprised if this allowed you to shelter assets from legitimate creditors. It would be a gaping loophole in inheritance law. Frankly, if your fathers debts are more than the value of his assets, including the value of the house, I suspect you will not be able to keep the house. It will be sold to pay off the creditors. I would certainly talk to a lawyer about this as there might be some provision in the law that you can take advantage of. Ill gladly yield on this point to anyone with specific knowledge of New Jersey inheritance law.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."
Why is there some latency between the time a check deposit was processed and when one can withdraw the money on Fidelity CMAs?,"Every bank and credit union in the US has a Deposit Agreement and Disclosures document, Bank of America is no different. Our general policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits available to you no later than the first business day after the day of your deposit. However, in some cases we place a hold on funds that you deposit by check. A hold results in a delay in the availability of these funds. that sounds great but ... For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If you make a deposit on a business day that we are open at one of our financial centers before 200 p.m. local time, or at one of our ATMs before 500 p.m. local time in the state where we maintain your account, we consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after such times, or on a day when we are not open or that is not a business day, we consider that the deposit was made on the next business day we are open. Some locations have different cutoff times. so if you deposit a check on Friday afternoon, the funds are generally available on Tuesday. but not always... In some cases, we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you by the first business day after the day of your deposit. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. The first 200 of your deposits, however, may be available no later than the first business day after the day of your deposit. If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available by the first business day after the day of your deposit, we generally notify you at the time you make your deposit. We also tell you when the funds will be available. Ok what happens when the funds are available... In many cases, we make funds from your deposited checks available to you sooner than we are able to collect the checks. This means that, from time to time, a deposited check may be returned unpaid after we made the funds available to you. Please keep in mind that even though we make funds from a deposited check available to you and you withdraw the funds, you are still responsible for problems with the deposit. If a check you deposited is returned to us unpaid for any reason, you will have to repay us and we may charge your account for the amount of the check, even if doing so overdraws your account. Fidelity has a similar document Each check deposited is promptly credited to your account. However, the money may not be available until up to six business days later, and we may decline to honor any debit that is applied against the money before the deposited check has cleared. If a deposited check does not clear, the deposit will be removed from your account, and you are responsible for returning any interest you received on it. I would think that the longer holding period for Fidelity is due to the fact that they want to wait long enough to make sure that the number of times they have to undo investments due to the funds not clearing is nearly zero.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is there some latency between the time a check deposit was processed and when one can withdraw the money on Fidelity CMAs?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

In general, yes, that is true, but... Consider this very bad strategy Buy one share of stock and sell it one minute later, and repeat this every minute of the day. Obviously you would bleed your account dry with fees. However, even this horrible strategy still meets your criteria because if this bad strategy had an edge beyond the transaction fees you would likely still make a profit. In other words, your conclusion reduces to an uninteresting statement If there were no transactions fees, then if your trading system has an edge then you will likely make a profit.

Dispute credit card transaction with merchant or credit card company?,"You should dispute the transaction with the credit card. Describe the story and attach the cash payment receipt, and dispute it as a duplicate charge. There will be no impact on your score, but if you dont have the cash receipt or any other proof of the alternative payment  its your word against the merchant, and he has proof that you actually used your card there. So worst case  you just paid twice. If you dispute the charge and it is accepted  the merchant will pay a penalty. If it is not accepted  you may pay the penalty on top of the original charge, depending on your credit card issuer  some charge for ""frivolous"" charge backs. It will take several more years for either the European merchants to learn how to deal with the US halfbaked chip cards, or the American banks to start issue proper chipandPIN card as everywhere else. Either way, until then  if the merchant doesnt know how to handle signatures with the American credit cards  just dont use them. Pay cash. Given the controversy in the comments  my intention was not to say ""no, dont talk to the merchant"". From the description of the situation it didnt strike me as the merchant would even bother to consider the situation. A less than honest merchant knows that you have no leverage, and since youre a tourist and will probably not be returning there anyway  whats the worst you can do to them? A bad yelp review?

Long vs. short term capital gains on real estate,"No, its not all longterm capital gain. Depending on the facts of your situation, it will be either ordinary income or partially shortterm capital gain. You should consider consulting a tax lawyer if you have this issue. This is sort of a weird little corner of the tax law. IRC 12211223 dont go into it, nor do the attendant Regs. It also somewhat stumped the people on TaxAlmanac years ago they mostly punted and just declared it selfemployment income, avoiding the holding period issue. But I did manage to find it in BNA Portfolio 562, buried in there. That cited to a court case Commr v. Williams, 256 F.2d 152 5th Cir. 1958 and to Revenue Ruling 75524 and to another Rev. Rul.. Rev Rul 75524 cites Fred Draper, 32 T.C. 545 1959 for the proposition that assets are acquired progressively as they are built. Note also that land and improvements on it are treated as separate assets for purposes of depreciation Pub 946. So between Williams which says something similar but about the shipbuilding industry and 75524, as well as some related rulings and cases, you may be looking at an analysis of how long your property has been built and how built it was. You may be able to apportion some of the building as longterm and some as shortterm. Whether the apportionment should be as to cost expended before 1 year or value created before 1 year is explicitly left open in Williams. It may be simpler to account for costs, since youll have expenditure records with dates. However, if this is properly ordinary income because this is really business inventory and not merely investment property, then you have fully ordinary income and holding period is irrelevant. Your quick turnaround sale tends to suggest this may have been done as a business, not as an investment. A proper advisor with access to these materials could help you formulate a tax strategy and return position. This may be complex and lawdriven enough that youd need a tax lawyer rather than a CPA or preparer.

splitting a joint mortgage  one owner in home,"Get a lawyer to put this in contract form, with everything spelled out explicitly. What is fair is what the two of you agree upon.

That would mean that if he rents out his half, all the rental income is his if you decide to live in your half, all the savings of not paying rent are yours. Each of you pays your half of mortgage, insurance, and other shared costs. Repairs to shared infrastructure should be done by someone both of you trust.

Are companies like EquityZen legitimate and useful?,"Full disclosure Im an intern for EquityZen, so Im familiar with this space but can speak with the most accuracy about EquityZen. Observations about other players in the space are my own. The employee liquidity landscape is evolving. EquityZen and Equidate help shareholders employees, exemployees, etc. in private companies get liquidity for shares they already own. ESOFund and 137 Ventures help with option financing, and provide loans and exotic structures on loans to cover costs of exercising options and any associated tax hit. EquityZen is a private company marketplace that led the second wave of VCbacked secondary markets starting early 2013. The mission is to help achieve liquidity for employees and other private company shareholder, but in a companyapproved way. EquityZen transacts with share transfers and also a proprietary derivative structure which transfers economics of a companys shares without changing voting and information rights. This structure typically makes the transfer process cheaper and faster as less paperwork is involved. Accredited investors find the process appealing because they get access to companies they usually cannot with small check sizes. To address the questions in Dzts post 1. EquityZen doesnt take a loan shark approach meaning they dont front shareholders money so that they can purchase their stock. With EquityZen, youre either selling your shares or selling all the economic riskupside and downsidein exchange for todays value. 2. EquityZen only allows company approved deals on the platform. As a result, companies are more friendly towards the process and they tend to allow these deals to take place. Noncompany approved deals pose risks for buyers and sellers and are ultimately unsustainable. As a buyer, without company blessing, youre taking on significant counterparty risk from the seller will they make good on their promise to deliver shares in the future? or the risk that the transfer is impermissible under relevant restrictions and your purchase is invalid. As a seller, youre running the risk of violating your equity agreements, which can have severe penalties, like forfeiture of your stock. Your shares are also much less marketable when youre looking to transact without the companys knowledge or approval. 3. Terms dont change depending an a shareholders situation. EquityZen is a professional company and values all of the shareholders that use the platform. Its a marketplace so the market sets the price. In other situations, you may be at the mercy of just one large buyer. This can happen when youre facing a big tax bill on exercise but dont have the cash because you have the stock. 4. EquityZen doesnt offer loans so this is a non issue. 5. Not EquityZen! EquityZen creates a clean break from the economics.

What price can I buy IPO shares for?,"If you participate in an IPO, you specify how many shares youre willing to buy and the maximum price youre willing to pay. All the investors who are actually sold the shares get them at the same price, and the entity managing the IPO will generally try to sell the shares for the highest price they can get. Whether or not you actually get the shares is a function of how many your broker gets and how your broker distributes them  which can be completely arbitrary if your broker feels like it. The price that the market is willing to pay afterward is usually a little higher. To a certain extent, this is by design a good deal for the shares is an incentive for the big millionbilliondollar financiers who will take on a good bit of risk buying very large positions in the company which they cant flip at the higher price, because theyd flood the market with their shares and send the price down.

Do I pay taxes on a gift of mutual funds?,"First of all, in the U.S., no Federal gift tax has to be paid by the recipient of the gift it is the donor who has to pay gift tax, if any is due. Nor does the recipient have to pay Federal income tax on the gift it is not considered taxable income. I do not believe that any states view matters differently for the purposes of state gift and income taxes, but I am always ready to be disabused of any such fondlyheld notions. If your parents were required to pay any gift tax, that would have been at the time the gift was originally given and only if they gifted more than the maximum allowable exemption per person for that year. Currently the exemption is 14K from each donor per recipient per year. Additional gifts were made by your parents to you during your minority when your parents paid any income tax due on the distributions in your account, but these amounts would unlikely to have been larger than the exemption for that year. In any case, gift tax is none of your concern. If you have been declaring the income from distributions from the mutual funds all these years, then the only tax due on the distributions from the funds in 2013 is the Federal income tax for the 2013 tax year plus a special assessment of Medicare tax on investment income if your income is large unlikely based on your question and followup comment. If you sold all or part of your shares in the funds in 2013, then you would need to calculate the basis of your investments in the fund in order to figure out if you have capital gains or losses. Ditto if you are thinking of cashing out in 2014 and wish to estimate how much income tax is due. But if you want to just hang on to the funds, then there is no immediate need to figure out the basis right away, though taking care of the matter and keeping in top of things for the future will be helpful. As a final note, there is no tax due on the appreciation of the funds shares. The increased value of your account because the funds share price rose is not a taxable event nor are decreases in the account deductible. These are called unrealized capital gains or losses and you do not pay tax on them or deduct them as losses until you realize the gains by disposing of the property.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Do I pay taxes on a gift of mutual funds?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

I cosigned for a friend who is not paying the payment,"Without all the details its hard to tell what options you may have, but none of them are good. When you cosign you are saying that, you believe the primary signer will make good on the loan, but that if he doesnt you will. You are 100 responsible for this debt. As such, there are some actions you can take. First, really try to stress to your friend, that they need to get you outta this loan. Urge them to refinance with out you if they can. Next look for ""better"" ways of defaulting on the loan and take them. Depending on what the loan is for you could deedinlue or short sale. You may just have to admit default. If you work with the bank, and try not to drag out the process, you will likely end up in a better place down the line. Also of importance is ownership. If you pay the loan, do you get ownership of the thing the loan was secured against? Usually not, but working with an attorney and the bank, maybe. For example, if its a car, can the ""friend"" sign over the car to you, then you sell it, and reduce your debt. Basically as a cosigner, you have some rights, but you have all the responsibilities. You need to talk to an attorney and possibly the bank, and see what your options are.

Is the need to issue bonds a telltale sign that the company would have a hard time paying coupons?,"Apple is currently the most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation and it has issued bonds for instance. Amazon have also issued bonds in the past as have Google. One of many reasons companies may issue bonds is to reduce their tax bill. If a company is a multinational it may have foreign earnings that would incur a tax bill if they were transferred to the holding companys jurisdiction. The company can however issue bonds backed by the foreign cash pile. It can then use the bond cash to pay dividends to shareholders. Ratings Agencies such as Moodys, Fitch and Standard  Poors exist to rate companies ability to make repayments on debt they issue. Investors can read their reports to help make a determination as to whether to invest in bond issues. Of course investors also need to determine whether they believe the Ratings Agencies assesments.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is the need to issue bonds a telltale sign that the company would have a hard time paying coupons?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why would a stock opening price differ from the offering price?,"The offering price is what the company will raise by selling the shares at that price. However, this isnt usually what the general public sees as often there will be shows to drive up demand so that there will be buyers for the stock. That demand is what you see on the first day when the general public can start buying the stock. If one is an employee, relative or friend of someone that is offered, ""Friends and Family"" shares they may be able to buy at the offering price. Pricing of IPO from Wikipedia states around the idea of pricing A company planning an IPO typically appoints a lead manager, known as a bookrunner, to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the shares should be issued. There are two primary ways in which the price of an IPO can be determined. Either the company, with the help of its lead managers, fixes a price ""fixed price method"", or the price can be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data compiled by the bookrunner ""book building"". Historically, some IPOs both globally and in the United States have been underpriced. The effect of ""initial underpricing"" an IPO is to generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes publicly traded. Flipping, or quickly selling shares for a profit, can lead to significant gains for investors who have been allocated shares of the IPO at the offering price. However, underpricing an IPO results in lost potential capital for the issuer. One extreme example is theglobe.com IPO which helped fuel the IPO ""mania"" of the late 90s internet era. Underwritten by Bear Stearns on November 13, 1998, the IPO was priced at 9 per share. The share price quickly increased 1000 after the opening of trading, to a high of 97. Selling pressure from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down, and it closed the day at 63. Although the company did raise about 30 million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place the company might have left upwards of 200 million on the table. The danger of overpricing is also an important consideration. If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may fall in value on the first day of trading. If so, the stock may lose its marketability and hence even more of its value. This could result in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Facebook IPO in 2012. Underwriters, therefore, take many factors into consideration when pricing an IPO, and attempt to reach an offering price that is low enough to stimulate interest in the stock, but high enough to raise an adequate amount of capital for the company. The process of determining an optimal price usually involves the underwriters ""syndicate"" arranging share purchase commitments from leading institutional investors. Some researchers e.g. Geoffrey C., and C. Swift, 2009 believe that the underpricing of IPOs is less a deliberate act on the part of issuers andor underwriters, than the result of an overreaction on the part of investors Friesen  Swift, 2009. One potential method for determining underpricing is through the use of IPO Underpricing Algorithms.

If the Banks follow a different calander, there would be additional overhead of segregating transactions for reporting.

What are the pros and cons of buying an item on installments with zero percent interest?,"If and only if there is a zero interest installment plan available, technically the only uncontrollable risk is that there will likely be a hard inquiry on your credit report which may or may not also have a corresponding debt obligation attached to it. Personally, I recently signed up for one such plan with Google and I had a hard inquiry but no debt added to my report. The other risks are that 1 your monthly payment goes up, so if you are living on a tight budget the added payment might make it harder to meet your next bill, and 2 you could miss a payment which generally triggers interest to accrue retroactively at a high rate, and in some cases could be grounds for immediate repayment. The pro  reward of these plans is that you have to spend less of your capital upfront, which you may be able to use for other purposes presumably with a higher net present value than purchasing the item youre considering outright. A larger example would be purchasing a new car. You want to buy a 50k car and you have the cash on hand to pay in full, but you are being offered 0 interest for 36 months. You may be more inclined to take a loan at 0 with 0 down payment and invest your money in another vehicle no pun intended that offers you a decent rate of return and you will come out ahead in the end. Of course, this example works in a perfect world where you can get such an offer, there are no extra fees available, you arent worrying about your debttoincome ratio in preparation for a big purchase like a house, there isnt a higher insurance premium to consider, etc. In short, 0 financing, be it for a phone or a car, can be a nice perk for the informed consumer who is not using the financing as a way to purchase outside their financial means, but it is offered by companies as a way to make people buy things they normally would not and, hopefully, capitalize on people missing payments in order to reap the sweet 20 interest rates generally seen with these offers. In your specific situation with the phone, you should consider if you get a discount on your monthly plan for purchasing outright, or if you can get the phone subsidized if you sign a contract and you know you like your provider enough to stay for its duration. If the monthly plan rate stays the same and youre looking at either 500 now or 500 over 24 months and you dont mind a hard inquiry, theres not much of compelling reason to pass on the financing and hold on to your 500.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are the pros and cons of buying an item on installments with zero percent interest?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

When do I sell a stock that I hold as a longterm position?,"The psychology of investing is fascinating. I buy a stock thats out of favor at 10, and sell half at a 400 profit, 50share. Then another half at 100, figuring you dont ever lose taking a profit. Now my Apple shares are over 500, but I only have 100. The 10 purchase was risky as Apple preiPod wasnt a company that was guaranteed to survive. The only intelligent advice I can offer is to look at your holdings frequently, and ask, ""would I buy this stock today given its fundamentals and price?"" If you wouldnt buy it, you shouldnt hold it. This is in contrast to the company ratings you see of buy, hold, sell. If I should hold it, but you shouldnt buy it to hold, that makes no sense to me. Disclaimer  I am old and have decided stock picking is tough. Most of our retirement accounts are indexed to the SP. Maybe 10 is in individual stocks.

Car dealers offering lower prices when financing a used car,"It is a legitimate practice. The dealers do get the loan money ""up front"" because theyre not holding the loan themselves they promptly sell it to someone else or more commonly just act as salesmen for a lending institution and take their profit as commission or origination fees. The combined deal is often not a good choice for the consumer, though. Remember that the dealers goal is to close a sale with maximum profit. If theyre offering to drop the price 2k, they either didnt expect to actually get that price in the first place, or expect at least 2k of profit from the loan, or some combination of these. Standard advice is to negotiate price, loan, and tradein separately. First get the dealers best price on the car, compare it to other dealer and other cars, and walk away if you dont like their offer. Repeat for the loan, checking the dealers offer against bankscredit unions available to you. If you have an older car to unload, get quotes for it and consider whether you might do better selling it yourself.  Standard unsolicited plug for Consumef Reports ""car facts"" service, if youre buying a new car which isnt usually the best option latemodel used is generally a better value. For a small fee, they can tell you what the dealers real cost of a car is, after all the hidden incentives and rebates. That lets you negotiate directly on how much profit they need on this sale... and focuses their attention on the fact that the time they spend haggling with you is time they could be using to sell the next one. Simply walking into the dealer with this printout in your hand cuts out a lot of nonsense. The one time I bought new, I basically walked in and said ""Its the end of the model year. Ill give you 500 profit to take one of those off your hands before the new ones come in, if youve got one configured the way I want it."" Closed the deal on the spot the only concession I had to make was on color. It doesnt always work some salesmen are idiots. In that case you walk away and try another dealer.

Is there a way to roll over shortterm gains and avoid capital gain tax,"If the investments are in a nonretirement, taxable account, theres not much you can do to avoid shortterm capital gains if you sell now.

This allows you to lock in your gains now but you wont benefit from potential future appreciation. Buying puts also costs , so do the ROI calculation.

When should you use an actively managed mutual fund in a 401k?,"For US stocks its a bit of a gamble. Many actively managed funds underperform the market indexes, but some of them outperform in many years. With an index you will get average results.

On the other hand, if you want to diversify some of your investments into international stocks, bonds, junk bonds, and real estate REITs active management is highly likely to be better than indexing.

Is buying a lottery ticket considered an investment? ,"There is a clear difference between investing and gambling. When you invest, you are purchasing an asset that has value. It is purchased in the hopes that the asset will either increase in value or generate income. This definition holds true whether you are investing in shares of stock, in real estate, or in a comic book collection. You can also purchase debt if you loan money, you own debt that will hopefully be repaid and generate income. Gambling is playing a game for chance. When you gamble, you have not purchased an asset you have only paid to participate in a game. Some games have a degree of skill blackjack, poker, others are pure chance slot machine. In most gambling games, the odds are against the player and in favor of the one running the game. Lottery tickets, without a doubt, are gambling. There is a good article on Investopedia that discusses the difference between investing and gambling in more detail. One thing that this article discusses is the house edge, or the advantage that the people running a gambling game have over the players. With most casino games, the house has an advantage of between 1 and 15 over the players. With a typical lottery, the house edge is 50. To address some of the points made by the OPs recent edit and in the comments I do not think the definitions of investment and gambling need to be dependent on expected value. There can be bad investments, where the odds of a good result are low. Similarly, there could be gambling games where the odds are in the players favor, either due to the skill of the player or through some quirk of the game its still gambling. Investing is purchasing an asset gambling is a game of chance. I do not consider a lottery ticket an asset. When you buy a lottery ticket, you are just paying a fee to participate in a game. It is the same as putting a coin in a slot machine. The fact that you are given a piece of paper and made to wait a few days for the result do not change this. Assets have inherent value. They might be valuable because of their ability to generate income stocks, bonds, debt, their utility precious metals, commodities, real estate, or their desirability as a thing of beauty collectibles, for example.

How do I determine ownership split on a franchise model?,"There is no one solution to every project finance problem. Two models might make sense in this situation, however.

One one hand, the interest should be high enough to reward you in a successful outcome for the amount of risk that you take on if things dont work out. On the other, the interest rate needs to be low enough where his earnings after loan repayment justify your friends effort, in addition to being competitive to ant rate your friend could secure from a bank. The downside to this plan is you dont directly benefit from the franchises profits. In this model, you will record the cash that each of you invests. Since your friend is also adding ""sweat equity"" by setting up and operating the franchise, you will need to quantify the work that your friend and you invest into the franchise. Then you can determine how much each of you has invested in terms of dollars and split any franchise profits based on those proportions.

After that. under the US Uniform Commerical Code they are considered ""stale checks"" and banks need not accept them. My experience is that they generally wont  but you probably shouldnt count on that, either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks. The check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money  but since checks can be cancelled andor a replacement check may have been issued, its value for that purpose may be limited. You can try depositing it and see what happens. If that doesnt work or you dont want to bother trying it you can contact the retirement plan, point out that this check went uncashed, and ask them to send you a replacement. If they havent already done so you might want to check your own records for that, there shouldnt be any problem with this. Note Many business checks have a statement printed on them that theyre only good for 90 days or so.

Short term parking of a large inheritance?,"I am sorry for your loss, this person blessed you greatly. For now I would put it in a savings account.

How do I know if my mutual fund is compounded?,"When we talk about compounding, we usually think about interest payments. If you have a deposit in a savings account that is earning compound interest, then each time an interest payment is made to your account, your deposit gets larger, and the amount of your next interest payment is larger than the last. There are compound interest formulas that you can use to calculate your future earnings using the interest rate and the compounding interval. However, your mutual fund is not earning interest, so you have to think of it differently. When you own a stock and your mutual fund is simply a collection of stocks, the value of the stock hopefully grows. Lets say, for example, that you have 1000 invested, and the value goes up 10 the first year. The total value of your investment has increased by 100, and your total investment is worth 1100. If it grows by another 10 the following year, your investment is then 1210, having gained 110. In this way, your investment grows in a similar way to compound interest. As your investment pays off, it causes the value of the investment to grow, allowing for even higher earnings in the future. So in that sense, it is compounding. However, because it is not earning a fixed, predictable amount of interest as a savings account would, you cant use the compound interest formula to calculate precisely how much you will have in the future, as there is no fixed compounding interval. If you want to use the formula to estimate how much you might have in the future, you have to make an assumption on the growth of your investment, and that growth assumption will have a time period associated with it. For example, you might assume a growth rate of 10 per year. Or you might assume a growth rate of 1 per month. This is what you could use in a compound interest formula for your mutual fund investment. By reinvesting your dividends and capital gains and not taking them out in cash, you are maximizing your ""compounding"" by allowing those earnings to cause your investment to grow.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How do I know if my mutual fund is compounded?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it safe to take a new mortgage loan in Greece?,"Please clarify your question. What do you mean by ""..loan in Greece""? If you are referring to taking a mortgage loan to purchase residential property in Greece, there are two factors to consider If the loan originates from a Greek bank, then odds are likely that the bank will be nationalized by the government if Greece defaults. If the loan is external i.e. from J.P. Morgan or some foreign bank, then the default will certainly affect any bank that tradesmaintains Euros, but banks that are registered outside of Greece wont be nationalized. So what does nationalizing mean for your loan? You will still be expected to pay it according to the terms of the contract. Id recommend against an adjustable rate contract since rates will certainly rise in a default situation. As for property, thats a different story. There have been reports of violence in Greece already, and if the country defaults, imposes austerity measures, etc, odds are there will be more violence that can harm your property. Furthermore, there is a remote possibility that the government can attempt to acquire your private property. Unlikely, but possible. You could sue in this scenario on property rights violations but things will be very messy from that point on. If Greece doesnt default but just exits the Euro Zone, the situation will be similar. The Drachma will be weak and confidence will be poor, and unrest is a likely outcome. These are not statements of facts but rather my opinion, because I cannot peek into the future. Nonetheless, I would advise against taking a mortgage for property in Greece at this point in time.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is it safe to take a new mortgage loan in Greece?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why is Insider Trading Illegal?,"To be flippant it is illegal because it is against the law there is no considered involved, it just is. To elaborate, part of the illusion of the stock exchange and other marketlike entities is that of apparent fairness. If I think a stock will go up because it is involved in a growing industry, that is generally public information. Conversely if I have a dim view of a particular company because of its track record of product launches, that is similarly out in the open. A secret formula is something that I invented or discovered, not presumably something that I stole from someone else. To stretch that further If I notice that Company X stock always moves with Company Y stock, that is indeed something that I have found, that I can try to profit from. It is secret to me, but not particularly dependent upon information not available to others, just that my interpretation is better. So trading on information in the public domain is fine, as it preserves the principal of fairness I mentioned, whereas inside knowledge breaks that principal.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why is Insider Trading Illegal?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

I have savings and excess income. Is it time for me to find a financial advisor?,"Others have mentioned the term fiduciary but havent really gone in to what that is. Despite the name ""financial advisor"" there is no legal In the US mandate as to what that means. Often times a financial advisor is little more than a sales rep whose job it is to sell particular financial instruments. These people will give you good generic advice such as ""make sure you have a nest egg"" and ""dont spend more than you make"". However when the rubber hits the road in terms of how to save they will often recommendinsistpressure a particular assetsecurity which doesnt necessarily meet your riskreward preferencetolerance. Often times the assets they pitch have high fees. These people wont charge you for their time because their time is a loss leader for the commissions they make on selling their products. In contrast a fiduciarys job responsibility is to look out for your interests. They shouldnt receive any kind of payment based on what assets you buy.

Should you keep your stocks if you are too late to sell?,"The stock price is not only based on the general market trend and the stocks current profitability and prospects, but is also based on prediction of how the stocks prospects might change in the future.

Stocks and Bankruptcy,"As Mhoran said, the risks of buying a bankrupt company are huge, and even successful bankruptcy turnarounds dont involve keeping the same stock. For instance, the GM bankruptcy was resolved by the company more or less selling all its valuable assets brands, factories, inventory to a new version of itself, using that money to pay off what liabilities it could, and then dissolving. The new company then issued new stock, and you had to buy the new stock to see it rise the old stock became worthless. AA could have gone the same way Delta could have bought it out of bankruptcy and consumed it outright, with any remaining shareholders being paid off at market value. Thats probably the best the market was hoping for. Instead, the deal is a much more equal merger AMR brings a very large airport network and aircraft fleet to the table, and Delta brings its cash, an alsoconsiderable fleet and network, and a management team thats kept that airline solvent.

Would I qualify for a USDA loan?,"Id like to suggest a plan. First, I know you want to buy a house. I get that, and that is an awesome goal to work for. You need to really sit down and decide why you want a house. People often tell we that they want a house because they are throwing their money away renting. This is just not true. There is a cost of renting, that is true, but there is also a cost of owning. There are many things with a house that you will have to pay for that will add little or no equityvalue. Now that equity is nice to have, but make no mistake under no circumstance does every dime you put into your house increase its value. This is a huge misconception. There is interest, fees, repairs, taxes, and a bunch of other stuff that you will spend money on that will not increase the value of your home. You will do no harm, waiting a bit, renting, and getting to a better place before you buy a house. With that out of the way, time for the plan. Note Im not saying wait to buy a house I am saying think of these as steps in the large house buying plan. Get your current debt under control. Your credit score doesnt suck, but its not good either. Its middle of the road. Your going to want that higher if you can, but more importantly than that, you want to get into a pattern of making debt then honoring it. The single best advise I can give you is what my wife and I did. Get a credit card you have one dont get more and then get into a habit of not spending more on that credit card than you actually have in the bank. If you have 50 in the bank, only spend that on your credit card. Then pay it in full, 100, every payday twice a month. This will improve your score quite a bit, and will, in time, get you in the habit of buying only what you can afford. Unless there has been an emergency, you should not be spending more on credit than you actually have. Your car loan needs to get under control. Im not going to tell you to pay it off completely, but see point 2. Your car debt should not be more than you have in the bank. This, again is a credit building step. If you have 7.5k in the bank and own 7.5k on your car, your ability to get a loan will improve greatly. Start envelope budgeting. There are many systems out there, but I like YNAB a lot. It can totally turn your situation around in just a few months. It will also allow you to see your ""house fund"" growing. Breaking Point So far this sounds like a long wait, but its not. It also sounds like I am saying to wait to actually buy a house, and Im not. I am not saying get your debt to 0, nor do I think you should wait that long. The idea is that you get your debt under control and build a nice solid set of habits to keep it under control. A look at your finances at this point Now, at this point you still have debt, but your credit cards are at 0 and have been, every payday for a few months. Your car loan still exists, but you have money in the bank to cover this debt, and you could pay it off. It would eat your nest egg, but you could. You also have 15k set aside, just for the house. As you take longer looking for that perfect house, that number keeps growing. Your bank account now has over 25,000 in it. Thats a good feeling on its own, and if you stick with your plan, buy your house and put down 15k, you still have plenty of wiggle room between credit cards that are not maxed out, and a 7.5k ""padding"" in case the roof falls in. Again it sounds like Im saying wait. But Im not, Im saying plan better. All of these goals are very doable inside one year, a rough year to be sure, but doable. If you want to do it comfortably, then take two years.

Why not pay in full upfront for a car?,"In general Id say, yeah, if you can pay cash, pay cash. If you pay cash, then by definition you pay zero interest. If you get a loan, youll pay interest. Most people get a loan to buy a car because they dont have the cash. Possible reasons not to pay cash when you could One Technically you can pay cash, but if you did, you would have little or no reserve for emergencies. Like if the car costs, say, 20,000.00, and you have 20,010.00 in your bank account, then technically you could afford to pay cash, but you probably shouldnt, because you dont want to have just 10 left. What if tomorrow something comes up? Two Arguably, you have a place to invest money that pays more than the interest on the loan. Like say you can get a car loan for, whatever the going rate is today, say 6. And you know a place to invest your money that is very safe and almost guaranteed to pay 10. It would make sense to borrow to buy the car, invest the cash, and then withdraw money from the investment to make the payments on the car. Youd end up 4 ahead. There are a lot of catches to that strategy, though. The biggest is that the more the investment pays, the more likely that it is risky. If you thought the investment would pay 10 but it ends up paying only 4, then you will lose money by this strategy. Also, theres the psychological element Many people SAY and fully INTEND to invest their money, but then find other things they want to buy and so spend it instead.

Will getting a second credit card help my credit rating?,"Besides your credit score, there are other smart reasons to have a second line of credit.

Getting a second line of credit with a different institution than your first allows you the flexibility to cancel one and move your business should the deal become unfavorable to you. Multiple lines of credit in of itself is a plus to your credit score albeit a small one You can organize your finances. One card handles the recurring payments in your life, the second incidentals. The expected activity type might make it easier to detect fraud. When you get your second line of credit, get it from a different institution than where you have any other business now. A credit union if you can, or a small local bank. Make sure there is no annual fee, and if there is a reward, be certain it is worth it. Cash back is my favorite because I can spend cash where I like, whereas ""points"" have to come out of product in their catalogs. Lower interest rate is best of all.

Why would you ever turn down a raise in salary?,"I dont know of a situation where rejecting a raise would make sense. Often, one can be in a phaseout of some benefit, so that even though youre in a certain tax bracket, the impact of the next 100 is greater than the bracket rate alone. Taxation of social security benefits is one such anomaly. It can be high, but never over 100. Update  The Affordable Care Act contains such an anomaly  go to the Kaiser Foundation site, and see the benefit a family of three might receive. A credit for up to 4631 toward their health care insurance cost. But, increase the income to above 78120 Modified Adjusted Gross Income MAGI and the benefit drops to zero. The fact that the next dollar of income will cost you 4631 in the lost credit is an example of a stepfunction in the tax code. Id still not turn down the raise, but Id ask that it be deposited to my 401k. And when reconciling my taxes each April, Id use an IRA in case I still went over a bit. Consider, its April, and your MAGI is 80,120. Even if you dont have to cash to deposit to the IRA, you borrow it, from a 24 credit card if need be.

What does Chapter 11 Bankruptcy mean to an investor holding shares of a Chapter 11 Company?,"I held shares in BIND Therapeutics, a small biotechnology company on the NASDAQ that was liquidated on the chapter 11 auction block in 2016. There were sufficient proceeds to pay the debts and return some cash to shareholders, with payments in 2016 and 2017. Some payments have yet to occur. The whole process is counterintuitive and full of landmines, both for tax preparation  planning and receiving payments Landmine 0 Some shareholders will sell in a panic as soon as the chapter 11 is announced. This would have been a huge mistake in the case of BIND, because the eventual liquidation payments were worth 3 or so times as much as the share price after chapter 11. The amount of the liquidation payments wasnt immediately calculable, because the companys intellectual property had to be auctioned. Landmine 1 The large brokerages Vanguard, Fidelity, TDA, and others mischaracterized the distributions to shareholders on form 1099, distributed to both shareholders and the IRS. The bankruptcy trustee considered this to be their responsibility. According to the tax code and to the IRS website, the liquidation is taxed like a sale of stock, rather than a dividend. ""On the shareholder level, a complete liquidation can be thought of as a sale of all outstanding corporate stock held by the shareholders in exchange for all of the assets in that corporation. Like any sale of stock, the shareholder receives capital gain treatment on the difference between the amount received by the shareholder in the distribution and the cost or other basis of the stock."" Mischaracterizing the distributions as dividends makes them wrongly ineligible to be wiped out by the enormous capital loss on the stock. Vanguards error appeared on my own 1099, and the others were mentioned in an investor discussion on stocktwits. However, Geoffrey L Berman, the bankruptcy trustee stated on twitter that while the payments are NOT dividends, the 1099s were the brokers responsibility. Landmine 2 Many shareholders will wrongly attempt to claim the capital loss for tax year 2016, or they may have failed to understand the law in time for proper tax planning for tax year 2016. It does not matter that the companys BINDQ shares were cancelled in 2016. According to the IRS website ""When a shareholder receives a series of distributions in liquidation, gain is recognized once all of the shareholders stock basis is recovered. A loss, however, will not be recognized until the final distribution is received."" In particular, shareholders who receive the 2017 payment will not be able to take a capital loss for tax year 2016 because the liquidation wasnt complete. Late discovery of this timing issue no doubt resulted in an endofyear underestimation of 2016 overall capital gains for many, causing a failure to preemptively realize available capital losses elsewhere. Im not going to carefully consider the following issues, which may or may not have some effect on the timing of the capital loss Landmine 3 Surprisingly, it appears that some shareholders who sold their shares in 2016 still may not claim the capital loss for tax year 2016, because they will receive a liquidation distribution in 2017. Taken at face value, the IRS websites statement ""A loss, however, will not be recognized until the final distribution is received"" appears to apply to shareholders of record of August 30, 2016, who receive the payouts, even if they sold the shares after the record date. However, to know for sure it might be worth carefully parsing the relevant tax code and treasury regs. Landmine 4 Some shareholders are completely cut out of the bankruptcy distribution. The bankruptcy plan only provides distributions for shareholders of record Aug 30, 2016. Those who bought shares of BINDQ afterwards are out of luck. Landmine 5 According to the discussion on stocktwits, many shareholders have yet to receive or even learn of the existence of a form [more secure link showing brokers served here] required to accept 2017 payments. To add to confusion there is apparently ongoing legal wrangling over whether the trustee is able to require this form. Worse, shareholders report difficulty getting brokers required cooperation in submitting this form. Landmine 6 Hopefully there are no more landmines. Boom. DISCLAIMER I am not a tax professional.

Is it safe to take a new mortgage loan in Greece?,"While I would be very leery of making any Investments in Greece, and if I lived there might want to strongly consider a larger than average investment in international funds such as an index fund on the US, UK, or German exchanges Having debt in Greece might not be such a bad thing... if only it was denominated in local currency. The big issue is that right now, youd be taking out a loan on property in greece, that would be denominated in Euros. If worse comes to worse, and Greece is kicked out of the EU and forced to go back to the drachma, then you might be in a situation where the bank says ""this loan is in Euros, we want payment in the same"" and if the drachma is plummeting vs the Euro, you could find your earning power presuming you were then paid in drachma greatly diminished.. And since youd be selling the house for drachma, you might be way underwater in terms of the value of the house due to currency exchange vs what you owed. Now, if Greece were currently on the drachma, and you were talking about a mortgage in the same, Id say go for it. Since what tends to happen when a government has way overspent is they just print more money rather than default.. that tends to lead to inflation, and a falling currency value vs other countries.

"Companies that use their cash to buy back stock, issue dividends, etc.  how does this this typically affect share price?","So far buying of own by own companies like Apple, is concerned it will surely raise the price of the script. At some level, the share prices are a factor of supply and demand at a given price. Apple being a very demanded script, its supply in the market goes down with the buy back. After a while, this will surely make the script price rise. It also depends at what price the buy back is affected. If the buy back is done at a right price, it will help the existing shareholder. If a very high price is paid, it will erode shareholders wealth. Hence each buy back needs to be studies separately. There are several and at times complex variables which determines if the buy back is good for continuing shareholders or not.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Companies that use their cash to buy back stock, issue dividends, etc.  how does this this typically affect share price?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

The data doesnt dig that deep. To discuss the ""Spend More With Plastic?"" phenomenon  I have no skin in the game, I dont sell credit card services. So if the answer is yes, you spend more with cards, Ill accept that. Heres my issue  The studies are all contrived. Give college students 10 cash and 10 gift cards and send them into the cafeteria. Cute, but it produces no meaningful data. I can tell you that when I give my 13yr old 20 cash, it gets spent very wisely. A 20 Starbucks card, and shes treating friends and family to lattes. No study needed, the result is immediate and obvious. Any study worth looking at would first separate the population into two groups, those who pay in full each month and those who carry a balance. Then these two groups would need to be subdivided to study their behavior if they went all cash. Not a simply survey, and not cheap to get a study of the number of people you need for meaningful data. Ive read quotes where The David claimed that card users spend 10 more than cash users. While I accept that Graphths concern is valid, that he may spend more with cards than cash, there is no study that I can find which correlates to a percentage result as all studies appear to be contrived with small amounts to spend.

Total ETF value decreased after underlying stock increased in price,"According to your post, you bought seven shares of VBR at 119.28 each on August 23rd. You paid 711,35. Now, on August 25th, VBR is worth 120.83. So you have But you want to know what you have in EUR, not USD. So if I ask Google how much 845.81 is in EUR, it says 708,89. Thats even lower than what youre seeing. It looks like USD has fallen in value relative to EUR. So while the stock price has increased in dollar terms, it has fallen in euro terms. As a result, the value that you would get in euros if you sold the stock has fallen from the price that you paid. Another way of thinking about this is that your price per share was 101,72 and is now 101,33. Thats actually a small drop. When you buy and sell in a different currency that you dont actually want, you add the currency risk to your normal risk. Maybe thats what you want to do. Or maybe you would be better off sticking to eurodenominated investments. Usually youd do dollardenominated investments if some of your spending was in dollars. Then if the dollar goes up relative to the euro, your investment goes up with it. So you can cash out and make your purchases in dollars without adding extra money. If you make all your purchases in euros, I would normally recommend that you stick to eurodenominated investments. The underlying asset might be in the US, but your fund could still be in Europe and list in euros. Thats not to say that you cant buy dollardenominated investments with euros. Clearly you can. Its just that it adds currency risk to the other risks of the investment. Unless you deliberately want to bet that USD will rise relative to EUR, you might not want to do that. Note that USD may rise over the weekend and put you back in the black. For that matter, even if USD continues to fall relative to the EUR, the security might rise more than that. I have no opinion on the value of VBR. I dont actually know what that is, as it doesnt matter for the points I was making. Im not saying to sell it immediately.

What is the best way to stay risk neutral when buying a house with a mortgage?,"Note I am making a USAassumption here keep in mind this answer doesnt necessarily apply to all countries or even states in the USA. You asked two questions Im looking to buy a property. I do not want to take a risk on this property. Its sole purpose is to provide me with a place to live. How would I go about hedging against increasing interest rates, to counter the increasing mortgage costs? To counter increasing interest rates, obtaining a fixed interest rate on a mortgage is the answer, if thats available. As far as costs for a mortgage, that depends, as mortgages are tied to the value of the propertyhome. If you want a place to live, a piece of property, and want to hedge against possible rising interest rates, a fixed mortgage would work for these goals. Ideally Id like to not lose money on my property, seeing as I will be borrowing 95 of the propertys value. So, Id like to hedge against interest rates and falling property prices in order to have a risk neutral position on my property. Now we have a different issue. For instance, if someone had opened a fixed mortgage on a home for 500,000, and the housing value plummeted 50 or more, the person may still have a fixed interest rate protecting the person from higher rates, but that doesnt protect the property value. In addition to that, if the person needed to move for a job, that person would face a difficult choice move and sell at a loss, or move and rent and face some complications. Renting is generally a good idea for people who 1 have not determined if theyll be in an area for more than 510 years, 2 want the flexibility to move if their living costs rises which may be an issue if they lose wages, 3 dont want to pay property taxes varies by state, homeowners insurance, or maintenance costs, 4 enjoy regular negotiation something which renters can do before resigning a lease or looking for a new place to live. Again, other conditions can apply to people who favor renting, such as someone might enjoy living in one room out of a house rather than a full apartment or a person who likes a ""change of scenes"" and moves from one apartment to another for a fresh perspective, but these are smaller exceptions. But with renting, you have nothing to resell and no financial asset so far as a property is concerned thus why some real estate agents refer to it as ""throwing away money"" which isnt necessarily true, but one should be aware that the money they invest in renting doesnt go into an asset that can be resold.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is the best way to stay risk neutral when buying a house with a mortgage?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Wage earners of age  60 with dependents What Life Insurance, if any, should they buy?","Without knowing the WSCs objectives, priorities of those objectives and affordability we cannot determine which type of insurance is best. Life insurance for seniors is very expensive if you examine the per unit cost e.g. cost per 1000 of death benefit. Therefore affordability is a critical deciding factor for WSC. Lets assume that we know the WSCs affordability and therefore the monthly premium is a fixed determined number, then there is a inverse relationship between the length of coverage and the amount of coverage. We have to achieve a balance between these two factors to best meet the WSCs objective.

How many days does Bank of America need to clear a bill pay check,"Firstly, it isnt so generous. It is a winwin, but the bank doesnt have to mail me a free box of checks with my new account, or offer free printing to compete for my business. They already have the infrastructure to send out checks, so the actual cost for my bank to mail a check on my behalf is pretty minimal. It might even save them some cost and reduce exposure. All the better if they dont actually mail a check at all. Per my bank Individuals and most companies you pay using Send Money will be mailed a paper check. Your check is guaranteed to arrive by the delivery date you choose when you create the payment. ... A select number of companiesvery large corporations such as telecoms, utilities, and cable companiesare part of our electronic biller network and will be paid electronically. These payments arrive within two business days... So the answer to your question depend on what kind of bill pay you used. If it was an electronic payment, there isnt a realistic possibility the money isnt cashed. If your bank did mail a paper check, the same rules would apply as if you did it yourself. I suppose it would be up to the bank. When I checked with my banks support this was their answer. Therefore per this answer Do personal checks expire? [US] It is really up to your bank whether or not they allow the check to be cashed at a later date. If you feel the check isnt cashed quickly enough, you would have to stop payment and contact whoever you were trying to pay and perhaps start again. Or ask them to hustle and cash the check before you stop it. Finally, I would bet a dime that your bank doesnt ""prefund"" your checks. They are just putting a hold on the equivalent money in your account so you dont overdraw. That is the real favor they do for you. If you stopped the check, your money would be unfrozen and available.

If your total annual out of pocket for health insurance is 5,000year, then emergency fund gets 2,500 and so on.

Dollarcost averaging How often should one use it? What criteria to use when choosing stocks to apply it to?,"How often should one use dollarcost averaging? Trivially, a dollar cost averaging DCA strategy must be used at least twice! More seriously, DCA is a discipline that people typically investors with relatively small amounts of money to invest each month or each quarter use to avoid succumbing to the temptation to ""time the market"". As mhoranpsprep points out, it is wellsuited to 401k plans and the like e.g. 403b plans for educational and nonprofit institutions, 457 plans for State employees, etc, and indeed is actually the default option in such plans, since a fixed amount of money gets invested each week, or every two weeks, or every month depending on the payroll schedule. Many plans offer just a few mutual funds in which to invest, though far too many people, having little knowledge or understanding of investments, simply opt for the moneymarket fund or guaranteed annuity fund in their 4xx plans. In any case, all your money goes to work immediately since all mutual funds let you invest in thousandths of a share. Some 401k403b457 plans allow investments in stocks through a brokerage, but I think that using DCA to buy individual stocks in a retirement plan is not a good idea at all. The reasons for this are that not only must shares must be bought in whole numbers integers but it is generally cheaper to buy stocks in round lots of 100 or multiples of 100 shares rather than in odd lots of, say, 37 shares. So buying stocks weekly, or biweekly or monthly in a 401k plan means paying more or having the money sit idle until enough is accumulated to buy 100 shares of a stock at which point the brokerage executes the order to buy the stock and this is really not DCA at all. Worse yet, if you let the money accumulate but you are the one calling the shots ""Buy 100 shares of APPL today"" instead of letting the brokerage execute the order when there is enough money, you are likely to be timing the market instead of doing DCA. So, are brokerages useless in retirement fund accounts? No, they can be useful but they are not suitable for DCA strategies involving buying stocks. Stick to mutual funds for DCA. Do people use it across the board on all stock investments? As indicated above, using DCA to buy individual stocks is not the best idea, regardless of whether it is done inside a retirement plan or outside. DCA outside a retirement plan works best if you not trust yourself to stick with the strategy ""Ooops, I forgot to mail the check yesterday oh, well, I will do it next week"" but rather, arrange for your mutual fund company to take the money out of your checking account each weekmonthquarter etc, and invest it in whatever funds you have chosen. Most companies have such programs under names such as Automatic Investment Program AIP etc. Why not have your bank send the money to the mutual fund company instead? Well, that works too, but my bank charges me for sending the money whereas my mutual fund company does AIP for free. But YMMV. Dollarcost averaging generally means investing a fixed amount of money on a periodic basis. An alternative strategy, if one has decided that owning 1200 shares of FlyByKnight Co is a good investment to have, is to buy round lots of 100 shares of FBKCO each month. The amount of money invested each month varies, but at the end of the year, the average cost of the 1200 shares is the average of the prices on the 12 days on which the investments were made. Of course, by the end of the year, you might not think FBKCO is worth holding any more. This technique worked best in the ""good old days"" when bluechip stocks paid what was for all practical purposes a guaranteed dividend each year, and people bought these stocks with the intention of passing them on to their widows and children.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Dollarcost averaging How often should one use it?

Is there an advantage to a traditional but nondeductable IRA over a taxable account? [duplicate],"The simplest answer is that you can convert the IRA to a Roth, and since it was already taxed, pay no tax on conversion. If, in your hypothetical situation, you happen to have an IRA already in place, you are subject to prorata rules on conversions, e.g. your balance is total 40K, 10K not deducted, a conversion is 75 taxed, convert 20K and the tax is on 15K of that money. But, there also might be a time when you are able to transfer IRA money into a 401k, effectively removing the pretax deposits, and leaving just post tax money for a free conversion.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is there an advantage to a traditional but nondeductable IRA over a taxable account?

Is business the only way to become a millionaire?,"Not at all. The Millionaire Next Door offers a book full of anecdotes on couples that earned money and saved their way to being millionaires. I believe about 13 or so had businesses, but the rest were employed and simply saved wisely. 3860yr saved for 40 years at 8 will return 1M. Adjust the numbers to hit a million sooner or reach a higher goal. The Author might be accused of survey bias. This is the phenomenon of studying the final results without looking at the pool of people years prior. Little Adv is correct that while 13 of millionaires may have gotten that way by starting a business, that says nothing about how many businesses need to start to find the one millionaire that resulted. I view the book more as a lesson of ""spend beneath your means"" and focus on his anecdotes of the dual income couples who saved their way to this status.

When I pull the numbers for each years return and apply an annual 3860 deposit, the 40 years ends with 2.2M. A 1 fee, or 1 lower return resulted in 1.6M.

Should I buy a house or am I making silly assumptions that I can afford it?,"When I bought my own place, mortgage lenders worked on 3 x salary basis. Admittedly that was joint salary  eg you and spouse could sum your salaries. Relaxing this ratio is one of the reasons we are in the mess we are now. You are shrewd my view to realise that buying is better than renting. But you also should consider the short term likely movement in house prices. I think this could be down. If prices continue to fall, buying gets easier the longer you wait. When house prices do hit rock bottom, and you are sure they have, then you can afford to take a gamble. Lets face it, if prices are moving up, even if you lose your job and cannot pay, you can sell and you have potentially gained the increase in the period when it went up. Also remember that getting the mortgage is the easy bit.

Are there any statistics that support the need for Title Insurance?,"The point of title insurance is that when you buy a house, it is possible that you may eventually find out that the seller didnt actually own the property  either because they were trying to deceive you, or some transfer of ownership in the past wasnt carried out properly. If that happens you can find yourself with no house, and still owing the mortgager the purchase price. Hardly anybody can afford to take that kind of hit, which is why you need some form of protection against it. The traditional way of doing this was to get a lawyer to do a title search, in which they check that everything in order. However this costs tens of dollars at least to do the work for every sale, and hardly ever finds anything. Title Insurance is a company volunteering to take the hit for you if there turns out to be a problem, in return for a payment of less than the title search would cost. In essence they are saying that its cheaper to take the risk than do the work. What are the statistics? This report seems to indicate that payout is around 5 of premium, but title insurance is a oneoff premium and the payout can theoretically happen many years down the line. However it is almost certain that the insurance companies have done the math and believe that selling this insurance will be profitable for them, so they believe that payouts are going to be substantially less than 100. Is title insurance worth it for you? If the payout is 5 of premiums, the in a purely statistical sense it is not worth it. You would on average gain more by not taking it. However that is true of almost all insurance. The policy is there to protect you in the unlikely but not impossible event where you would otherwise lose a huge amount of money. Unless you can afford to lose the value of your house, you need some form of protection. Weve already seen that the only other form of protection is a title search, and they cost more. The other issue is that if you are taking a mortgage, your mortgager will absolutely insist that you have either a title search or title insurance. There is no other way  and title insurance is the cheaper of the two. In this case it is best to look on the title insurance as simply a cost of doing business. Its irrelevant whether its worth it or not  you cant do the transaction without it.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are there any statistics that support the need for Title Insurance?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?,"Definitely not. You are too young. Let me explain Your money will be locked up for at least 40 years, and you will have to navigate some really quirky and trapladen rules in order to get money for simple things. Lets say you want to buy a house. You wont be able to leverage the 401K for that. College Tuition? Limits. Your money is locked in and you may get some match, but that assumes your smartest decision at your age is to save money for retirement. At your age, you should be investing in your career, and that requires cash at hand. If you want to withdraw early you pay more of a penalty than just the tax rate. Put differently investing in your human capital, at a young age, can yield stronger results than just squirreling money. Id say dont worry until you are 30. BTW Im 24 now. I used to save money in a 401K for a few months, before I understood the rules. Since then, I decided against 401K and just saved the money in a bank. After a few years, I had enough to start my business  the 401K couldnt give me that opportunity. Further Explanation I am in the NYC area. Many of my friends and I had to decide between living in manhattan or choosing to live in the outer boroughs or NJ. One thing I noticed was that, while the people in manhattan were burning much more money to the tune of 1500 per month, they were actually much more productive and were promoted more often. Having lived in brooklyn and in manhattan, even though it is less expensive, you actually lose at least an hour a day thanks to the commute and have to deal with crap like the 6 train. Personally, after moving in, I invested the extra time in myself i.e. sleeping more, working longer hours, side projects. Now, when all is said and done, the people who decided to invest in themselves in the short term are financially more secure both jobwise and economically, thanks to a few bonus cycles than those who decided to save on rent and put it in a 401K. As far as the traps are concerned, my dad tried to take out a student loan and was denied thanks to a Vanguard quirk which didnt allow more than 50K to be borrowed even though the account had over 500K to begin with.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Is keeping track of your money and having a budget the same thing?,"What you are doing is neither one. You are simply watching to make sure you dont overdraw, which itself suggests you might be living hand to mouth and not saving. Keeping track of your money and budgeting are useful tools which help people get on top of their money. Which tends to have the effect of allowing you to save. How much did you spend on groceries last month? Eating out? Gas? If you were ""keeping track of your money"", you could say immediately what you spent, and whether that is above or below average, and why. How much do you plan to spend in the next 3 months on gas, groceries, eating out? If you knew the answer to that question, then you would have a ""budget"". And if those months go by, and your budget proves to have been accurate, or educates you as to what went wrong so you can learn and fix it... then your budget is a functioning document that is helping you master your money. Certainly the more powerful of the two is the ""keeping track"", or accounting of what has happened to you so far. Its important that you keep track of every penny without letting stuff ""slip through the cracks"". Here you can use proper accounting techniques and maybe accounting software, just like businesses do where they reconcile their accounting against their bank statements and wallet cash. I shortcut that a little. I buy gift cards for McDonalds, Panera, Starbucks, etc. and buy my meals with those. That way, I only have one transaction to log, 40  McDonalds gift card instead of a dozen little meals. It works perfectly fine since I know all that money went to fast food. A little more dangerous is that I treat wallet cash the same way, logging say two monthly entries of 100 to cash rather than 50 little transactions of left 1 tip at restaurant. This only works because cash is a tiny part of my overall expenditures  not worth accounting. If it added up to a significant part, Id want accounting on that.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is keeping track of your money and having a budget the same thing?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Does the Fed keeping interest rates low stimulate investment in the stock market and other investments?,"Investopedia has this note where youd want the contrapositive point The interest rate, commonly bandied about by the media, has a wide and varied impact upon the economy. When it is raised, the general effect is a lessening of the amount of money in circulation, which works to keep inflation low. It also makes borrowing money more expensive, which affects how consumers and businesses spend their money this increases expenses for companies, lowering earnings somewhat for those with debt to pay. Finally, it tends to make the stock market a slightly less attractive place to investment.

"In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive?","To add to Jasons answer a further mechanism is that of monopoly rents which you mention in your question. Movie theatres are often in shopping complexes which themselves may offer a particular cinema exclusivity, or physically remote from each other, making price comparison more difficult. Different companies may not offer the same movies similar to the way phone companies offer difficulttocompare contract pricing. Once youve paid for your movie ticket, if youre suddenly thirsty or peckish, the theatre is the only place selling snacks. Many theatres including film theatres discourage or refuse patrons from consuming products purchased elsewhere on site. A sense of ""capture"" is reinforced with ticket collection at the entrance or some form of barrier inside vs outside the cordon.

Approach to share options in the UK,"When your options vest, you will have the option to buy your companys stock at a particular price the strike price. A big part of the value of the option is the difference between the price that your companys stock is trading at, and the strike price of the option. If the price of the company stock in the market is lower than the strike price of the option, they are almost worthless. I say almost because there is still the possibility that the stock price could go up before the options expire. If your company is big enough that their stock is not only listed on an exchange, but there is an active options market in your companys stock, you could get a feel for what they are worth by seeing what the market is willing to buy or sell similar exchange listed options. Once the options have vested, you now have the right to purchase your companys stock at the specified strike price until the options expire. When you use that right, you are exercising the option. You dont have to do that until you think it is worthwhile buying company stock at that price. If the company pays a dividend, it would probably be worth exercising the options sooner, options dont receive a dividend. Ultimately you are buying your companys stock albeit at a discount. You need to see if your companys stock is still a good investment. If you think your company has growth prospects, you might want to hold onto the stock. If you think youd be better off putting your money elsewhere in the market, sell the stock you acquired at a discount and use the money to invest in something else. If there are any additional benefits to holding on to the stock for a period of time e.g. selling part to fit within your capital gain allowance for that year you should factor that into your investment decision, but it shouldnt force you to invest in, or remain invested in something you would otherwise view as too risky to invest in.

Implied or historical volatility to calculate theoretical options price with black scholes?,"Option pricing models used by exchanges to calculate settlement prices premiums use a volatility measure usually describes as the current actual volatility. This is a historic volatility measure based on standard deviation across a given time period  usually 30 to 90 days. During a trading session, an investor can use the readily available information for a given option to infer the ""implied volatility"". Presumably you know the option pricing model BlackScholes. It is easy to calculate the other variables used in the pricing model  the time value, the strike price, the spot price, the ""risk free"" interest rate, and anything else I may have forgotten right now. Plug all of these into the model and solve for volatility. This give the ""implied volatility"", so named because it has been inferred from the current price bid or offer. Of course, there is no guarantee that the calculated implied volatility will match the volatility used by the exchange in their calculation of fair price at settlement on the day or on the previous days settlement. Comparing the implied volatility from the previous days settlement price to the implied volatility of the current price bid or offer may give you some measure of the fairness of the quoted price if there is no perceived change in future volatility. What such a comparison will do is to give you a measure of the degree to which the current markets perception of future volatility has changed over the course of the trading day. So, specific to your question, you do not want to use an annualised measure. The best you can do is compare the implied volatility in the current price to the implied volatility of the previous days settlement price while at the same time making a subjective judgement about how you see volatility changing in the future and how this has been reflected in the current price.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Implied or historical volatility to calculate theoretical options price with black scholes?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Is it accurate to say that if I was to trade something, my probability of success cant be worse than random?","The previous answers make valid points regarding the risks, and why you cant reasonably compare trading for profitloss to a roll of the die. This answer looks at the math instead. Your assumption I have an equal probability to make a profit or a loss. Is incorrect, for the reasons stated in other answers. However, the answer to your question Can I also assume that probabilistically speaking, a trader cannot do worst than random? Is ""yes"". But only because the question is flawed. Consequently its throwing people in all directions with their answers. But quite simply, in a truly random environment the worst case scenario, no matter how improbable, is that you lose over and over again until you have nothing left. This can happen in sequential rolls of the dice AND in trading securitiesbondswhatever. You could guess wrong for every roll of the die AND all of your stock picks could become worthless. Both outcomes result in 0 assuming you do not gamble with credit. Tell me, which 0 is ""worse""? Given the infinite number of plays that ""random"" implies, the chance of losing your entire bankroll exists in both scenarios, and that is enough by itself to make neither option ""worse"" than the other. Of course, the opposite is also true. You could only pick winners, with an unlimited upside potential, but again that could happen with either dice rolls or stock picks. Its just highly improbable. my chances cannot be worse than random and if my trading system has an edge that is greater than the percentage of the transaction that is transaction cost, then I am probabilistically likely to make a profit? Nope. This is where it all falls apart. Just because your chances of losing it all are similarly improbable, does not make you more likely to win with one method or the other. Regression to the mean, when given infinite, truly random outcomes, makes it impossible to ""have an edge"".

How does a public company issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders?,"As others have posted, the company gains capital in return for its new shares. However, the share price can still fall. The problem is that the share marked is affected by supply and demand like any other marked. If the company just issues the new shares at marked price, they will have problems finding buyers. The people who are willing to pay that price has already bought as many shares as they want. The company does this to raise capital, and depends on the shares actually selling for this to work. So, they issue shares at below marked price to attract buyers and the shares get diluted. In the end the share will usually end up somewhere between the old marked price and the issue price. The old share owners are probably not too happy about this and will not accept this plan. At least here in Norway, share issue has to be accepted at a shareholder meeting So, what is often done instead is to issue buy options for the required number of shares at the belowmarked price. These options are given for free to the current share holders proportional to their current holding. If everybody exercises their options they get new cheap shares that compensates for the loss of share value. If they dont have the capital themselves, they can sell the options and get compensation that way instead.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does a public company issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it possible for all the owners of a stock to gain or lose money at the same time?,"Take the case where a stock has just two owners, A and B, both at 10. One of them sells his shares to C, at 11. Now B has made 1 in profit but is no longer an owner of the stock. A hasnt sold anything but his shares are worth 10 more due to the last traded price printed. C has bought shares at 11 and the price is 11, so technically he hasnt lost any money. In a larger market, there are winners and losers every day on a single stock, but they may not remain owners of a stock. There could be days in which those that remain owners are all winners  say when a stock goes up to an all time high and all those that are currently owners have an average buy price lower than the last traded price. And the reverse applies too. It is of course more complicated. Say you own a stock and let someone else ""borrow"" it for a shortselling opportunity he sells it in the market. For each uptick in price, you win, the short seller loses, and the guy he sold it to also wins. A person that has a covered call on a stock is not a winner beyond a point.

Personal Loan issuer online service,"Here is a simple loan payment calculator. If you allow early principal repayment, then you should just be able to plug in the new principal amount to find his new monthly payment someone please correct me if Im mistaken. Are you averse to creating a spreadsheet yourself in excel? I suppose it could become quite an undertaking, depending on how detailed you chose to get with the interest. Seems like it would be more direct and serve the dual purpose of recordkeeping. Its important to agree in advance whether prepayments go to principal or go partly to interest prepaying for periodic amounts not yet due, which are mixed principal and interest. Its a family loan, so it probably makes sense to allow the prepayments to pay down principal you dont need to structure your interest income and prevent him from depriving you of interest income which many bank loans will do. Allowing early principal repayment is pretty easy to calculate in your own excel spreadsheet, since you just need to know the remaining principal, time outstanding, and the interest rate. Note that if you are a US citizen, then the interest paid to you will be taxable income to you ""ordinary income"" rate. Your brother will not be able to deduct the interest payments, unless maybe they are used for something like his business or perhaps mortgage. There is no deduction for just a personal loan. Also, if you instead structured it without interest, then the interest not charged would be considered a gift under US gift tax law.

Are variable rate loans ever a good idea?,Whats going on here is that the variable rate loan is transferring some of the risk from the bank to you. In a reasonable deal taking on risk brings with it reward. Its the same thing as deductibles on insurancetheyre transferring some risk to you and thus your expected total cost goes down. Thus the proper evaluation of such deals is whether you can afford the outcome if you draw the short straw. If you feel you can afford the highest payment that can result then the variable rate is a good deal. If youre near your limit then stay with the safe option of the fixed rate. For a house this is easy enough to evaluaterun the calculations assuming the highest payment and see what the debttoincome ratio is. Note that when we were getting mortgages there was another factor involved the variable rate loans had a higher initiation cost.

Paying over the minimum mortgage payment,"First off, putting extra cash toward a mortgage early on, when most of the payments are going to interest, is the BEST time. If you pay an extra 1 on your mortgage today, you will save 30 years worth of interest assuming a 30 year mortgage. If in 29 years you pay an extra dollar, you will only save 1 year worth of interest. That said, there are lots of things that go into a decision like this. Do you have other debts? How stable is your income? What is the interest rate on your mortgage compared to any other debts you may have or potential investments you might make? How much risk are you willing to take? Etc. Mortgages tend to be very low interest, and, at least in the U.S., the interest on them is taxdeductible, making the effective interest rate even lower. If you have some other loan, you are almost always better to pay the other loan off first. If you dont mind a little risk, you are usually better off to invest your money rather than pay off the mortgage. Suppose your mortgage is 5. The average return on the stock market is something like 7 according to my buddy who works for Wells Fargo. So if you put 1000 toward your mortgage, youd save 50 the first year. Ignoring compounding for simplicity, changes the exact numbers but not the basic idea. If you put that same 1000 in the stock market, than if its a typical year youd make 70. You could put 50 of that toward paying the interest on your mortgage and youd have 20 left to go on a wild spending spree. The catch is that the interest on a mortgage is fixed, while the return on an investment is highly variable. In an AVERAGE year the stock market might return 7, but this year it might return 20 or it might lose 10 or a wide range of other possible numbers. Well, you might have a variable rate mortgage, but there are still usually some defined limits on how much it can vary.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Paying over the minimum mortgage payment?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

IRR vs. Interest Rates,"IRR is not subjective, this is a response to Laythesmack, to his remark that IRR is subjective. Not that I feel a need to defend my position, but rather, Im going to explain his. My company offered stock at a 15 discount. We would have money withheld from pay, and twice per year buy at that discount. Coworkers said it was a 15 gain. I offered some math. I started by saying that 10085 was 17.6, and that was in fact, the gain. But, the funds were held by the company for an average of 3 months, not 6, so that gain occurred in 3 months and I did the math 1.1764 and resulted in 91.5 annual return. This is IRR. Its not that its subjective, but it assumes the funds continue to be invested fully during the time. In our case the 91.5 was real in one sense, yet no one doubled their money in just over a year. Was the 91 useless? Not quite. It simply meant to me that coworkers who didnt participate were overlooking the fact that if they borrowed money at a reasonable rate, theyd exceed that rate, especially for the fact that credit lines are charged day to day. Even if they borrowed that money on a credit card, theyd come out ahead. IRR is a metric. It has no emotion, no personality, no goals. Its a number we can calculate.

One of extreme you could bet the entirety of your account on one trade, which would maximize your returns if you win, but leave you unable to further invest if you lose. On the other extreme, you could bet the smallest amount of capital possible over the course of several trades to increase the probability that youll even out to 70 accuracy over time. But this method would be extremely slow. So for your case, investing 40 each time is one way to find an optimal balance between these two extremes.

What kind news or information would make the price of a stock go up? ,"There is a highly related question which is much easier to answer what normally valueincreasing news about a company would cause that company to fall in value in the public stock market? By answering that, we can answer your question by proxy. The answer to that question being anything that makes investors believe that the company wont be able to maintain the level of profit. For example, lets say a company announces a 300 profit growth compared to the previous year. This should push the stock upwards maybe not by 300, but certainly by quite a bit. Lets also say that this company is in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling some highly useful gadget that lots of people want to buy. Now suppose that the company managed such an profit increase by one of In scenario 1 firing the engineering department, it is highly unlikely that the company will be able to come up with, manufacture and sell a Next Generation Gadget. Hence, while profit is up now, it is highly likely to go down in the months and years coming up. Because stock market investors are more interested in future profits than in past profits, this should push the value of the company down. In scenario 2 selling off the machinery, the company may very well be able to come up with a Next Generation Gadget, and if they can manufacture it, they might very well be able to sell it. However, no matter how you slice it, the shortterm costs for manufacturing either their current generation Gadget, or the Next Generation Gadget, are bound to go up because the company will either need to rent machinery, or buy new machinery. Neither is good for future profits, so the value of the company again should go down in response. In scenario 3 their product getting a large boost, the company still has all the things that allowed them to come up with, produce and sell Gadgets. They also have every opportunity to come up with, manufacture and sell Next Generation Gadgets, which implies that future profits, while far from guaranteed, are likely. In this case, the probability remains high that the company can actually maintain a higher level of profit. Hence, the value of the company should rise. Now apply this to a slightly more realistic scenario, and you can see why the value of a company can fall even if the company announces, for example, record profits. Hence, you are looking for news which indicate a present and sustained raised ability to turn a profit. This is the type of news that should drive any stock up in price, all else being equal. Obviously, buyer beware, your mileage may vary, all else is never equal, nothing ever hits the average, you are fighting people who do this type of analysis for a living and have every tool known available to them, etc etc. But thats the general idea.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What kind news or information would make the price of a stock go up?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How can I calculate total return of stock with partial sale?,"Treat each position or partial position as a separate LOT. Each time you open a position, a new lot of shares is created. If you sell the whole position, then the lot is closed. Done. But if you sell a partial quantity, you need to create a new lot. Split the original lot into two. The quantities in each are the amount sold, and the amount remaining. If you were to then buy a few more shares, create a third lot. If you then sell the entire position, youll be closing out all the remaining lots. This allows you to track each buysell pairing. For each lot, simply calculate return based on cost and proceeds. You cant derive an annualized number for ALL the lots as a group, because theres no common timeframe that they share.

"When youre really young and have about 2K to start investing  for retirement, why do some people advise you to go risky?","Why it is good to be risky The reason why it is good to be risky is because risky investments can result in higher returns on your money. The problem with being risky, is there is a chance you can lose money. However, in the long term you can usually benefit from higher returns even if you have a few slip ups. Let me show you an example These two lines are based off of placing 2,000 in a retirement fund at age of 20 and then at age of 25 start investing 6,500 a year based off of a salary of 65,000 with a company that will 1 to 1 match up to 5 IRA contribution, presumably someone with a Masters should be able to get this and then being able to increase your contribution amount by 150 a year as your salary begins to increase as well. The blue line assumes that all of this money that you are putting in a retirement account has a fixed 3 interest compounded yearly for simplicity sake every year until you retire. The red line is earning a 12 interest rate while you are 20 years old and then decreasing by 0.5 per year until you retire. Since this is using more risky investments when you are younger, I have even gone ahead and included losing 20 of your money when you are 24, another 20 when you are 29, and then again another 20 when you are 34. As you can see, even with losing 20 of your money 3 different times, you still end up with more money then you would have had if you stuck with a more conservative investment plan. If I change this to 50 each 3 times, you will still come out about equal to a more conservative investment. Now, I do have these 3 loses placed at a younger age when there is less to lose, but this is to be expected since you are being more risky when you are young. When you are closer to retirement you have less of a chance of losing money since you will be investing more conservatively. Why it is OK to be risky when you are young but not old Lets say you loose 20 of your 2,000 when you are young, you have 3040 years to make that back. Thats roughly 1 a month extra that you are having to come up with. So, if you have a risky investment go bad when you are young, you have plenty of time to account for it before you retire. Now lets say you have 1,000,000 when you are 5 years from retiring and loose 20 of it, you have to come up with an extra 3,333 a month if you want to retire on time. So, if you have a risky investment go bad when you are close to retiring, you will most likely have to work for many more years just to be able to recover from your loses. What to invest in This is a little bit more difficult question to answer. If there was one ""right"" way to invest your money, every one would be doing that one ""right"" way and would result in it not turning out to be that good of investment. What you need to do is come up with a plan for yourself. My biggest advice that I can give is to be careful with fees. Some places will charge a fixed dollar amount per trade, while others might charge a fixed dollar amount per month, while even others might charge a percentage of your investment. With only having 2,000 to invest, a large fee might make it difficult to make money.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: When youre really young and have about 2K to start investing  for retirement, why do some people advise you to go risky?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

First time home buyer. How to negotiate price?,"Well it all kind of depends. The Realtor is your pro, and you should communicate further with him. Is this a neighborhood on the decline? Is there a good reason to make such a low offer? Are you totally off base when you think 85K is fair, and if so why? Is he just working his tail off for you a great thing? One thing that is a key to this negotiation is financing. What does your financing status look like? A reasonable cash offer with no contingencies and a quick close might be less than 70K. A person with strong financing can get a better discount then a person that is questionable. It could be that the Realtor is testing the waters to find the bottom price. The home selling season is closed typically the summer, and the home has been on the market for a bit. Offering 70K might mean a counter at 82K, so you can work on an offer between 80 and 82. To me, it sounds like this guy is working for you. You should thank him. It is pretty hard to find a realtor that is willing to negotiate his pay down in order to save you money. Also he can answer the closing cost question better than us as he is more familiar with your particular market.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: First time home buyer.

Why buy insurance?,"Apart from legal requirements to have insurance, e.g. 3rd party car that other answers have covered well. We can think of all insurance as protecting our usable income, as we can use cashflow to pay the costs of a loan to replace whatever we decided not to insure. So for example, if I dont insure my house contents, I can replace them on my credit card if needed. Therefore we are paying for insurance out of our income, so as to protect our income, knowing that the cost of the protection is on average more than the benefit we get from it. But we all know that having an income of 50K is less than double the value of having an income of 25K. E.g. being able to eat and remain warm is more important to us then being able to go on anther holiday. This is way when someone has a higher income it requires more money to effect their actions.

There is no ""legal requirement"" to pay yourself a prevailing wage if doing so would put the company out of business. it is common for a companys principals not to draw wages from the business until it is viable enough to sustain payroll. I was in that situation when I first began my business, so the notion that somehow Im violating a law by being fiscally responsible for my own company is nonsense. Be wise with your new business. You didnt state why you feel the need to take some kind of payment out, but this can be a crucial mistake if it imperils your business or if that money could be better spent on marketing or some other areas which improve revenues. You can always create a salary deferral agreement between yourself and your own company which basically states that the company owes you wages but you are, for the time being, willing to defer accepting them until such time that the company has sufficient revenues to pay you. Thats one solution, but the simplest answer is, if you dont need the money youre thinking of paying yourself, dont do it.

The con is that this is usually for a short period of time longest Ive seen was 15 months after which if youre not careful, high interest rates will be charged.

United Kingdom Where to save money for a property deposit,"Ultimately you are as stuck as all other investors with low returns which get taxed. However there are a few possible mitigations.

Will I always be able to get a zerointerest credit card?,"After looking at the comments, and your replies it seems that your mind is made up ""You will always be able to obtain 0 credit, and nothing bad will ever happen"". Credit cards that offer 0 on balance transfers are very rare. Most have a transfer fee of some kind, which acts like an interest rate. This is a change that probably happened 10 years ago without much fanfare. From this you can draw a lesson what changes will come in the future? This site and others a full of ""tales of woe"" where people were playing musical chairs with credit, and when the music stopped, there was no chairs in sight. Job loss, medical expenses, unexpected taxes, natural disasters can all effect ones ability to make payments on time and happen. Once payments start being missed or are late, things tend to avalanche from there. It has happened to me, and loved ones. The pain and suffering is not worth it. Get out of debt. You claim that you are investing the money instead of paying on the debt, and you are making the delta between your prevailing investment rate 7. Did you include the balance transfer fee in your calculations? First off your investments could lose money. While 2015 was mostly flat, we have not had a correction in a long time. Some say we are long overdue. Secondly, how much money are we really talking about here? Say there is not a balance transfer fee, you could be guaranteed 7, and you are floating 10K.

Student loan payments and opportunity costs,"Already a lot of great answers, but since I ask myself this same question I thought Id share my 2 cents. As user541852587 pointed out, behavior is of the essence here. If youre like most recent grads, this is probably the first time in your life you are getting serious about building wealth. Can you pay your loans down quickly and then have the discipline to invest just as much  if not more  than you were putting towards your loans? Most people are good at paying bills in full and on time, yet many struggle to ""pay themselves"" in full and on time. As Brandon pointed out, you can do both. I find this makes a great deal of practical sense. It helps form good behaviors, boosts confidence, and ""diversifies"" those dollars. I have been paying double payments on my student loans while at the same time maxing out my IRA, HSA,  401k. I also have a rental property but thats another can of worms.

Found an old uncashed paycheck. How long is it good for? What to do if its expired?,"The two banks involved may have different policies about honoring the check. It might not be written on the check. Your bank may decide that the stale check has to be treated differently and will withhold funds for a longer period of time before giving you access to the money.

They may be concerned about insufficient funds, the age of the check, and the fact that the original account could have been closed. If you are concerned about the age of the check. You could go to your bank in person, instead of using deposit by ATM, scanner, or smart phone. This allows you to talk to a knowledgeable person. And if they are going to treat the check differently or reject the check, they can let you know right away. The audit may not have been concerned about the fact that the check hadnt been cashed because when they did the audit the check was still considered fresh. Some companies will contact you eventually to reissue the check so you they can get the liability off their books.

Must a company have a specific number of employees to do an IPO?,"While there is no legal reason to have a minimum number of employees, there can be a practical reason.

Once the investors are committed, they can cut expenses by firing people again. I have no idea how common this is, but it is a possibility. However, if it were really common, investors wouldnt be fooled anymore. Also, they risk being sued for fraud over this. Even if your friends worry is probably unfounded, you should be aware that working for a startup is always risky. They very often go bankrupt even if they try their best.

How much should I be contributing to my 401k given my employers contribution?,"You can only contribute up to 5 of your salary? Odd. Usually 401k contributions are limited to some dollar amount in the vicinity of 15,000 or so a year. Normal retirement guidelines suggest that putting away 1015 of your salary is enough that you probably wont need to worry much when you retire. 5 isnt likely to be enough, employer match or no. Id try to contribute 1015 of my salary. I think youre reading the rules wrong. Im almost certain. Its definitely worth checking. If youre not, you should seriously consider supplementing this saving with a Roth IRA or just an aftertax account. So. If youre with Fidelity and dont know what to do, look for a target date fund with a date near your retirement e.g. Target Retirement 2040 and put 100 in there until you have a better idea of what going on. All Fidelity funds have pretty miserable expense ratios, even their token SP500 index fund from another provider, so you might as let them do some leg work and pick your asset allocation for you. Alternatively, look for the Fidelity retirement planner tools on their website to suggest an asset allocation. As a very rough rule of thumb, as youre saving for retirement youll want to have N of your portfolio in bonds and the rest in stocks, where N is your age in years. Your stocks should probably be split about 70 US and 30 restofworld, give or take, and your US stocks should be split about 64 largecap, 28 midcap and 8 smallcap thats basically how the US stock market is split.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Are there any countries where citizens are free to use any currency?,"Sounds like you have a goldbug whispering in your ear. The Coinage Act doesnt restrict you from using foreign currency or lawful commodity or service to fulfill a debt. You are free to do that whenever you enter into an explicit or implicit contract with another party. If that wasnt the case, your kid trading his bag of chips for a bag of cookies at lunch would be a criminal act. It does mean that you ultimately must accept US currency to settle a debt. Following the previous example, if your kid gives his friend the bag of chips, but the cookies get destroyed somehow before being transferred, the friend can offer a couple of dollars to complete the transaction. The whole point of the Coinage Acts is to set a level playing field. If you dont pick one dominant store of value, you have a situation where it is impossible to evaluate the cost of goods and services. It has nothing to do with some competition with foreign currency.

Is it legal if Im managing my familys entire wealth?,"All the other answers posted thus far discuss matters from the perspective of US tax laws and are unanimous in declaring that what the OP wants to do is indeed a very bad idea. I fully agree it is a bad idea from the perspective of US tax laws, and is likely a bad idea from the perspective of Indian tax laws too, but what the OP wants to do is or used to be common practice in India. In more recent times, India has created a Permanent Account Number ""PAN number"" for each taxpayer for income tax purposes, and each bank account or investment must have the owners or firstnamed owners, in case of a joint account PAN number associated with it. This most likely has decreased the popularity of such arrangements, or has led to new twists being used. The OP has not indicated the residence and citizenship of his family or his own status for that matter, but if they are all Indian citizens resident in India and are Hindus, then there might be one mechanism for doing what the OP wants to do apply for a PAN number in the name of the Hindu Undivided Family and use this number to carry out the investments in the name of the Hindu Undivided Family. There presumably are similar statuses for undivided families for other religions, but I am not familiar with them. There are lots of matters here which are more legal questions than personal finance questions e.g. if the OP is a US tax resident, then the family presumably will not be able to claim Hindu Undivided Family status since the OP has been divided from the family for tax purposes or so I think. Even if HUF status is available, the OP might not be able to act as the pater familias while his father is alive, and so on.

Why I cant view my debit card preauthorized amounts?,"The simplest answer to why you cant see it in your online statement is a designbusiness decision that was made, most probably originally to make online statements differ as little as possible from old fashioned monthly printed statements the old printed statements never showed holds either. Some banks and card services actually do show these transactions online, but in my experience these are the rare exceptions  though with businesscommercial accounts I saw this more, but it was still rare. This is also partly due to banks fearing lots of annoying phone calls from customers and problems with merchants, as people react to ""hey, renting that car didnt cost 500!"" and dont realize that the hold is often higher than the transaction amount and will be justified in a few days or weeks..., etc  so please dont dispute the charges just yet. Behind the scenes, Ive had bankers explain it to me thusly the practice has bitten me before and it bothered me a lot, so Ive talked to quite a few bankers about this There are two kinds of holds ""soft holds"" and ""hard holds"". In a soft hold, a merchant basically asks the bank, ""Hey, is there at least 75 in this account?"" The bank responds, and then has its own individually set policy per account type as to how to treat that hold. Sometimes they reserve no money whatsoever  you are free to spend that money right out and rack up NSF fees to your hearts content. Yet some policies are to treat this identically to a hard hold and keep the money locked down until released. The hard hold is treated very much like an actual expenditure transaction, in that the money is locked and shown as no longer available to you. This varies by bank  some banks use an ""Account Balance"" and an ""Available Balance"", and some have done away with these dual terms and leave it up to you to determine what your balance is and whats ""available"" or you have to call them. The key difference in the hard hold and a real expenditure is, technically, the money is still in your bank account your bank has merely ""reserved"" it, earmarking it for a specific purchase and gently promising the merchant they can have their money later, but the biggest difference is there is a timelimit. If a merchant does not process a completion to the transaction to claim the money, your bank will lift the hold after a period of time Ive seen 730 days as typical in the US, again varying by institution returning your money to your balance that is available for purchasing and withdrawal. In every case, any vaguely decent banking institution allows you to call them, speak to some bank employee, and they can look up your account and inform you about the different sort of holds that are on your account that are not pendingcompleted purchase transactions. From a strictly cynical perhaps rightly jaded point of view, yes this is also used as a method to extort absurdly high fees especially from customers who keep a low balance in their account. I have had more than one bank charge NSF fees based on available balances that were due to holds made by gas pumps, for instance, even though my actual ""money in my account"" never went below 0 the holds were for amounts larger than the actual transaction. And yes, the banks usually would waive those fees if you bothered to get someone on the phone or in person and made yourself a nuisance to the right person for long enough, but they made you work for it. But I digress.... The reality is that there are lots of back and forth and middlemen in transactions like this, and most banks try to hide as much of this from you the client as possible, partly because its a huge confusing hassle and its part of why you are paying a bank to handle this nonsense for you to start with. And, as with all institutions, rules and policies become easily adjusted to maximize revenues, and if you dont keep sizable liquid minimum balances 100 of the time, all year long they target you for fees. To avoid this without having fat wads of extra cash in those accounts, is use an entirely disconnected credit card for reservations ONLY  especially when you are traveling and will be making rentals and booking hotels. Just tell them you wish to pay with a different card when you are done, and most merchants can do this without hassle. Since its a credit card with monthly billing you can often end up with no balance, no waiting around for a month for payments to clear, and no bank fees!

Is this formula accurate for weighing the difference between an SCorp and LLC?,"FICASE taxes are not 30. They are at most 15, including the employer portion. Employer also pays FUTA tax, and has additional payroll expenses like fees and worker compensation insurance. The employees FICA portion is limited up to a certain level of earnings 110100 this year, IIRC. Above it you only pay medicare taxes, not social security. SCorp earnings are not taxed at 15, these are not dividends. Theyre taxed at your ordinary income rate. You dont pay SE taxes on it, thats the only difference. I hope youre talking about tax treatment decision, because there are entirely different factors to keep in mind when youre organizing a business and making a decision between being it a LLC or a corporation. I believe you should pay some money to get a real advice that would apply to you, from a EACPA who would be doing the numbercrunching hopefully correctly.

What does it mean when my Money Market account lists both a dividend share and an APY?,"In a money market fund, one share is worth 1. For your fund, youll earn 0.0010 a year per share, or 0.10. That is all that you will earn. The APY is just another number to represent this interest rate, not a separate income stream. If you were expecting extra money from a separately credited dividend, you were mistaken. Usually the APY is a slightly different number than the interest rate, to reflect the way that the interest is compounded over the course of the year. In this case the compounding is too slight to notice with just 2 decimal places. If you were investing in a regular savings account, you would see the rate you are paid expressed as an APY also, but not as a dividend as no shares are involved and use that number to compare the two. If you were buying a bond fund or stock fund that did not have a fixed price, you could calculate the dividend yield based on the current stock price, but you would not probably see an APY listed.

Ways to save for childs college education where one need not commit to set contributions? [duplicate],"Since this post was migrated from Parenting, my reply was in the context where it appeared to be misrepresenting facts to make a point. Ive edited it to be more concise to my main point. In my opinion, the best way to save for your childs future is to get rid of as much of your own debt as possible. Starting today. For the average American, a car is 610. Most people have at least a couple credit cards, ranging from 1025 no crap. College loans can be all over the map 515 as can be signature 815 or secured bank loans 48. Try to stop living within your credit and live within your means. Yeah it will suck to not go to movies or shop for cute things at Kohls, but only today. First, incur no more debt. Then, the easiest way I found to pay things off is to use your tax returns and reduce your cable service both potentially Ks per year to pay off a big debt like a car or student loan. You just gave yourself an immediate raise of whatever your payment is. If you think long term were talking about longterm savings for a childs college there are things you can do to pay off debt and save money without having to take up a 2nd job... but you have to think in terms of years, not months. Is this kind of thing pie in the sky? Yes and no, but it takes a plan and diligence. For example, we have no TV service internet only service redirected an additional 100mo to the wifes lone credit card and we used 12 taxes to pay off the last 4k on the car. We did the same thing on our van last year. It takes willpower to not cheat, but thats only really necessary for the first yearish... well before that point youll be used to the Atkins Diet on your wallet and will have no desire to cheat. It doesnt really hurt your quality of life do you really NEED 5 HBO channels? and it sets everyone up for success down the line. The moral of the story is that by paying down your debt today, youre taking steps to reduce long haul expenditures. A stable household economy is a tremendous foundation for raising children and can set you up to be more able to deal with the costs of higher ed.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Ways to save for childs college education where one need not commit to set contributions?

What are some well known or well regarded arguments against investing?,"Oh, geez, wellregarded arguments against investing, hmm? Well, I have a couple. Theyre not against investing per se. Theyre asking about your priorities and whether you might have something better to do than inevesting And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do I will pull down my barns, and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.  Luke 121621 Christian or otherwise, there may be better things for you to do with your excess cash  indeed, with your life  than simply invest it to bring yourself more money. Many people find charitable contributions more important than spending a little more money on themselves immediately or in the future. Of course, you will need to decide what these things are that matter to you. Perhaps you would like to contribute to traditional charities. Perhaps you would like to fund education, or a religious organization, or the Democratic Party, or the Republican Party, or the Libertarian Party, or the Green Party, or the Tea Party, or Occupy Wall Street. Perhaps youd like to fund research into something. Perhaps you simply have friends and family that you want to make happy. Perhaps a small vacation to spend time with family is worth more to you now than the investment returns will be worth later. Moreover, note that economic decisions like this are made on the margin  its not so much a question of whether you invest at all, but whether you should invest more or less, and spenddonate more or less. I made me great works I builded me houses I planted me vineyards I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me. And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor.

I was given a 1099misc instead of a w2 what are my next steps?,"I agree that you should have received both a 1099 and a W2 from your employer. They may be reluctant to do that because some people believe that could trigger an IRS audit. The reason is that independent contractor vs employee is supposed to be defined by your job function, not by your choice. If you were a contractor and then switched to be an employee without changing your job description, then the IRS could claim that you should have always been an employee the entire time, and so should every one of the other contractors that work for that company with a similar job function. Its a hornets nest that the employer may not want to poke. But thats not your problem what should you do about it? When you say ""he added my Federal and FICA WH together"", do you mean that total appears in box 4 of your 1099? If so, it sounds like the employer is expecting you to repay the employer portion of FICA. Can you ask them if they actually paid it? If they did, then I dont see them having a choice but to issue a W2, since the IRS would be expecting one. If they didnt pay your FICA, then the amount this will cost you is 7.65 of what would have been your W2 wages. IMHO it would be reasonable for you to request that they send you a check for that extra amount. Note even though that amount will be less than 600 and you wont receive a 1099 in 2017 for it, legally youll still have to pay tax on that amount so I think a good estimate would be to call it 10 instead. Depending on your personality and your relationship with the employer, if they choose not to ""make you whole"", you could threaten to fill out form SS8. Additional Info Thank you Bobson for bringing this up. The situation you find yourself in is similar to the concept of ""ContracttoHire"". You start off as a contractor, and later convert to an employee. In order to avoid issuing a 1099 and W2 to the same person in a single tax year, companies typically utilize one of the following strategies Your particular situation is closest to situation 2, but the reverse. Instead of retroactively calling you a W2 employee the entire time, your employer is cheating and attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor the entire time. This is frowned upon by the IRS, as well as the employee since as you discovered it costs you more money in the form of employer FICA. From your description it sounds like your employer was trying to do you a favor and didnt quite follow through with it. What they should have done was never switch you to W2 in the first place if you really should have been a contractor, or they should have done the conversion properly without stringing you along.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: I was given a 1099misc instead of a w2 what are my next steps?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is paying off your mortage a 1 personal finance priority?,"Paying off your house quickly should be a 2level priority, behind making sure you have some basic savings but definitely ahead of any investing concerns, because your house is not an investment its your home.

If something disastrous happens, you lose your job, get in a serious car accident, your kid comes down with cancer, etc, it will put tremendous strain on your financial resources. If you own your home outright when this happens, it means that no matter what else might go wrong, you cant get foreclosed on and end up out on the streets, and thats worth more than any rate of return you can reasonably expect to find even in the best of times. Its a wellknown investing maxim to ""never bet anything that you cant afford to lose."" In light of that, consider this if you have a mortgage that is not paid off, thats exactly what youre doing.

Unless he has commingled assets and treated estate assets as his own, the legal separation should be quite strong.

Why does a real estate seller get to know the financing arrangements of the buyer?,"The buyer discloses the financing arrangements to the seller because it makes his offer more attractive. When a seller receives and accepts an offer, the deal does not usually close until 30 to 60 days later. If the buyer cannot come up with the money by closing, the deal falls apart. This is a risk for the seller. When a seller is considering whether or not to accept an offer, it is helpful to know the likelihood that the buyer can actually obtain the amount of cash in the offer by the closing date. If the buyer cant acquire the funding, the offer isnt worth the paper it is printed on. The amount of the down payment vs. the amount of financing is also relevant to the seller. Let me give you a realworld example that happened to me once when I was selling a house. The buyer was doing a nomoneydown mortgage and had no money for a down payment. He was even borrowing the closing costs. We accepted the offer, but when the bank did the appraisal, it was short of the purchase price. For most home sales, this would not be a problem, as long as the appraisal was more than the amount borrowed. But in this case, because the amount borrowed was more than the appraisal, the bank had a problem. The deal was at risk, and in order to continue either the buyer had to find some money somewhere which he couldnt, or we had to lower the price to save the deal. Certainly, accepting the offer from a buyer with no cash to bring to the table was a risk. In our case, we got lucky. We found some errors that were made in the appraisal, and got it redone.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why does a real estate seller get to know the financing arrangements of the buyer?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What are the reasons to get more than one credit card?,"There is almost no reason to get a second credit card  this is a very good arrangement for your creditor but not for you. Credit cards have high rates of interest which you have to pay unless you pay the credit off every month. Therefore, increasing your total credit capacity should not be your concern. Since internet technology lets you pay off your balance in minutes online, there is no reason to have multiple cards in order to avoid running out of a balance. If, on the other hand, you do not pay your existing card off every month, than getting another card can be even more dangerous, since youre increasing the amount of debt you take on. Id say at most it would make sense for you to grab a basic VISA, since most places do not accept AMEX.

How to calculate ownership for property with a partner,"i would recommend that you establish a landlordtenant relationship instead of joint ownership ie 100 ownership stake for one of you vs 0 for the other. it is much cleaner and simpler. basically, one of you can propose a monthly rent amount and the other one can chose to be either renter or landlord. alternatively, you can both write down a secret rental price offer assuming you are the landlord, then pick the landlord who wrote down the smaller rental price. if neither of you can afford the down payment, then you can consider the renters contribution an unsecured loan at an agreed interest rate and payment schedule. if you must have both names on the financing, then i would recommend you sell the property or refinance under a single name as quickly as possible when the relationship ends if not before, pay the renter back any remaining balance on the loan and leave the landlord with the resulting equity or debt. in any case, if you expect the unsecured loan to outlive your relationship, then you are either buying a house you cant afford, or partnering on it with someone you shouldnt.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How to calculate ownership for property with a partner?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it cheaper to use car Insurance or pay out of pocket?,"Theres not a single answer here, as the premium you pay for car insurance depends on multiple factors, including but not limited to All these factors contribute to the likelihood of getting into an accident, and the expected damage from an accident. So just having an accident and making a claim will likely raise your premium all else being equal, but whether or not it will be cheaper in the long run depends obviously on how much your premium goes up, which cannot determined without all of the facts. Your agent could tell you how much it would go up, but even making such an inquiry would likely be noted on your insurance record, and may cause your premium to go up although probably not by as much. However, the point of insurance is to reduce the outofpocket expenses from future accidents, so the question to ask is How likely am I to have another accident, and if I do, can I pay cash for it or will I need to offset some cost with an insurance claim.

15 year mortgage vs 30 year paid off in 15,"I just wanted to point out that the most ""leverage"" for prepaying occurs at the very beginning of the mortgage, and declines rapidly after that. So, your very best scenario is to get the 30year, and make one extra payment entirely to principal the first month of every year. This causes the amortization to drop by 96 payments, to about 22 years. I dont know of any other way that you can get nearly 4 times value for your money 22 payments extra to save 96 payments later.

Some products will be cheaper, some will be more expensive, but on average their prices will rise with inflation rates.

Do Americans really use checks that often?,"It is possible to not use checks in the US. I personally use a credit card for almost everything and often have no cash in my wallet at all. I never carry checks with me. If we wanted to, we could pay all of our monthly bills without checks as well, and many people do this. 30 years ago, grocery stores didnt generally accept credit cards, so it was cash or check, though most other kinds of stores and restaurants did. Now, the only stores that I have encountered in years that do not accept credit cards are a local chicken restaurant, and the warehouseshopping store Costco. Costco accepts its own credit card, but not Mastercard or Visa.

"Can savinginvesting 15 of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire?","Yes, quite easily, in fact. You left a lot of numbers out, so lets start with some assumptions. If you are at the median of middle income families in the US that might mean 70,000year. 15 of that is an investment of 875 per month. If you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6 return, then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old. 6 is a very conservative number, and as Ben Miller points out, the SP 500 has historically returned closer to 11. If you assumed an aggressive 9 return, and continued with that 875month for 40 years until you turn 65, that becomes 4 million. Start with a much more conservative 9hr for 18,720 per year 40 hours  52 weeks, no overtime. If that person saved 14 of hisher income or about 219 per month from 25 to 65 years old with the same 9, they would still achieve 1 million for retirement. Is it much harder for a poor person? Certainly, but hopefully these numbers illustrate that it is better to save and invest even a small amount if thats all that can be done. High income earners have the most to gain if they save and the most to lose if they dont. Lets just assume an even 100,000year salary and modest 401k match of 3. Even married filing jointly a good portion of that salary is going to be taxed at the 25 rate. If single youll be hitting the 28 income tax rate. If you can max out the 18,000 2017 contribution limit and get an additional 3,000 from an employer match for a total monthly contribution of 1750 40 years of contributions would become 8.2 million with the 9 rate of return. If you withdrew that money at 4 per year you would have a residual income of 300k throughout your retirement.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can savinginvesting 15 of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it possible to make money by getting a mortgage?,"The likely reason the mortgage is ""tricky to get"" is the adviser is probably recommending an interestonly mortgage in which there is no repayment of principle before maturity. That would allow you to deduct the amount of the interest expense from your taxable income. Your investment grows compound tax deferred and the principal invested the mortgage balance is completely tax free since it never qualifies as income for tax purposes. Example ideal scenario Refinance 100,000 on a 51 ARMinterest only at 3. Invest the 100,000 at 6. Each year you effectively pay taxes on only the gains greater than interest.

"I have a horrible 401k plan, with high expenses. Should I stay with it or move my money elsewhere?","The first question is essentially asking for specific investment advice which is offtopic per the FAQ, but Ill take a stab at 2 and 3 2 If my 401k doesnt change before I leave my job not planned in the near future, I should roll it over into my Roth IRA after I leave due to these high expense ratios, correct? My advice is that you should roll over a 401K into an IRA the first chance you get usually when you leave the job. 401K plans are NOTORIOUS for high expense ratios and why leave your money in a plan where you have a limited choice of investments anyway versus a selfdirected IRA where you can invest in anything you want? 3 Should I still max contribute with these horrible expense ratios? If they are providing a match, yes. Even with the expense ratios it is hard to beat the immediate return of an employer match. If they arent matching, the answer is still probably yes for a few reasons You already are maxing out your ability to contribute to sheltered accounts, so assuming you still want to sock away that money for retirement, the tax benefits are still valuable and probably offset the expense ratios. Although you seem to be an exception, it is hard for most people to be disciplined enough to put money in a retirement account after they have it in their hands versus autodeduction from paychecks.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Why cant I short a stock that sells for less than 5? Is there another way to go short on them?,"If this is the initial transaction, the rules of a short margin account say that if you shorted 1000 share of ABC at 5share your credit balance would be 5000 from the short plus you would have to put up yourself 5000 cash or 10,000 of marginal securities. So this is not really leveraging using margin. You have to put in just as much as the short generates. Is that what this relates to? Once the initial purchase has been made the minimum maintenance for a stock trading under 5 per share is 100 of the short market value in the margin account or 2.50 per share whichever is greater. For stock trading at 5share or greater the minimum maintenance requirement is 5share or 30 of the short market value, whichever is greater.

What does a Dividend will not be quoted ex mean?,"One occastion where ""will not be quoted ex"" is used is when a corporate action is occurring such as a spinoff. In such a case, the rights to, and the spinoff itself may be quoted separately on the home country exchange. However, if the company is based abroad, it may not be worth the expense for them to have an additional securities listing on the local US exchange. For example In November 2016, Yamana Gold TSX YRI, NYSE AUY announced it will have an initial public offering of a spinoff Brio Gold, to be listed on TSX as BRIO. Existing shareholders received a right to one share of the spinoff for every 16 shares they held of YRI or AUY. These rights were separately traded in advance of the IPO of the spinoff on TSX under ""YRI.RT"", but the prospectus they stated that the rights ""will not be quoted ex"" on NYSE, i.e. there was no separate listing on NYSE for these rights. The wording seems counterintuitive, but I suspect that is the attorneys who were preparing the prospectus used those specific words as they may have a very specific meaning e.g. from a statute or previous case.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What does a Dividend will not be quoted ex mean?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Which graduate student loans are preferable?,"Of course, the situation for each student will vary widely so youll have to dig deep on your own to know what is the best choice for your situation.

The major benefit of keeping your loans in the Direct Loan program is predictability.

401k lump sum distribution limited because of highly compensated employees?,"Its legal. In fact, they are required to do this, assuming you are in fact a HCE highly compensated employee to avoid getting in trouble with the IRS. Im guessing they dont provide documentation for the same reason they dont explain to you explicitly what the income thresholds are for social security taxes, etc  thats a job for your personal accountant. Heres the definition of a HCE An individual who Owned more than 5 of the interest in the business at any time during the year or the preceding year, regardless of how much compensation that person earned or received, or For the preceding year, received compensation from the business of more than 115,000 if the preceding year is 2014 120,000 if the preceding year is 2015, 2016 or 2017, and, if the employer so chooses, was in the top 20 of employees when ranked by compensation. There are rules the restrict distributions from plans like 401ks. For example, treasury reg 1.401a45b3 says that a plan cannot make a distribution to a HCE if that payment reduces the asset value of the plan to below 110 of the value of the plans current liabilities. So, after taking account all distributions to be made to HCEs and the asset value of the plan, everyone likely gets proportionally reduced so that they dont run afoul of this rule. There are workarounds for this. But, these are options that the plan administrators may take, not you. I suppose if you were still employed there and at a high enough level, a company accountant would have discussed these options with you. Note, theres a chance theres some other limitation on HCEs that Im missing which applies to your specific situation. Your best bet, to understand, is simply ask. Your money is still there, you just cant get it all this year.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

What is the minimum lot size number of shares for the London Stock Exchange?,"Good question! It seems to me that there is no minimum order size for shares trading on the LSE. Please note, I couldnt find an definite answer, but According to the ""International Order Book"" document see httpwww.londonstockexchange.comtradersandbrokersrulesregulationschangeandupdatesstockexchangenotices2010n2210attach1.pdf from the LSE page 7 Question 7 Would respondents support a revision of the minimum order size of 50 units? Whilst there was limited support for a low value based minimum order size the majority of respondents requested its complete removal. This was incorporated into the September 2010 quarterly review as per Service Announcement 001100910 and as from 20 September 2010, the minimum order size in all IOB securities has been 1 unit Even though not all trading on the LSE is performed on this IOB system, it would be very wierd if the international stocks can be traded in any size, while domestic stocks will have an minimum size.

How much should a new graduate with new job put towards a car?,"So many answers here are missing the mark. I have a 100k mortgagebecause that isnt paid off, I cant buy a car? Thats really misguided logic. You have a reasonably large amount of college debt and didnt mention any other debt Its a really big deal what kind of debt this is. Is it unsecured debt through a private lender? Is it a federal loan from the Department of Education? Lets assume the worst possible reasonable situation. You lose your job and spend the next year plus looking for work. This is the boat numerous people out of college are in far far far FAR more than the unemployment rates indicate. Federal loans have somewhat reasonable indentured servitude, but I digress repayment strategies you can base the payment on your current income through incomebased and incomecontinent repayment plans. If youre through a private lender, they still expect payment. In both casesbecause the US hit students with ridiculous lending practices, your interest rates are likely 510 or even higher. Given your takehome income is quite large and I dont know exactly the cost of living where you liveyou have to make some reasonable decisions. You can afford a car note for basically any car you want. Whats the worst that happens if you cant afford the car? They take it back. If you can afford to feed yourself, house yourself, pay your other monthly bills...you make so much more than the median income in the US that I really dont see any issues. What you should do is write out all your monthly costs and figure out how much unallocated money you have, but Id imagine you have enough money coming in to finance any reasonable new or used car.

Did my salesman damage my credit? What can I do?,"At one point in my life I sold cars and from what I saw, three things stick out. Unless the other dealership was in the same network, eg ABC Ford of City A, and ABC Ford of City B, they never had possession of that truck. So, no REAL application for a loan could be sent in to a bank, just a letter of intent, if one was sent at all. With a letter of intent, a soft pull is done, most likely by the dealership, where they then attached that score to the LOI that the bank has an automated program send back an automatic decline, an officer review reply, or a tentative approval eg tier 0,1,2...8. The tentative approval is just that, Tentative. Sometime after a lender has a loan officer look at the full application, something prompts them to change their offer. They have internal guidelines, but lets say an app is right at the line for 23 of the things they look at, they chose to lower the credit tier or decline the app. The dealership then goes back and looks at what other offers they had. Lets say they had a Chase offer at 3.25 and a CapOne for 5.25 they would say youre approved at 3.5, they make their money on the .25. But after Chase looks into the app and sees that, lets say you have been on the job for actually 11 months and not 1 year, and you said you made 50,000, but your 1040 shows 48,200, and you have moved 6 times in the last 5 years. They comeback and say no he is not a tier 2 but a tier 3  5.5. They switch to CapOne and say your rate has in fact gone up to 5.5. Ultimately you never had a loan to start with  only a letter of intent. The other thing could be that the dealership finance manager looked at your credit score and guessed they would offer 3.5, when they sent in the LOI it came back higher than he thought. Or he was BSing you, so if you price shopped while they looked for a truck you wouldnt get far. They didnt find that Truck, or it was not what they thought it would be. If a dealership sees a truck in inventory at another dealer they call and ask if its available, if they have it, and its not being used as a demo for a sales manager, they agree to send them something else for the trade, a car, or truck or whatever. A transfer driver of some sort hops in that trade, drives the 30 minutes  6 hours away and comes back so you can sign the Real Application, TODAY! while youre excited about your new truck and willing to do whatever you need to do to get it. Because they said it would take 25 days to ""Ship"" it tells me it wasnt available. Time Kills Deals, and dealerships know this they want to sign you TODAY! Some dealerships want ""honest"" money or a deposit to go get the truck, but reality is that that is a trick to test you to make sure you are going to follow through after they spend the gas and add mileage to a car. But if it takes 2 days, The truck isnt out there, or the dealer doesnt have a vehicle the other dealership wants back, or no other dealership likes dealing with them. The only way it would take that long is if you were looking for something very rare, an odd color in an unusual configuration. Like a top end model in a low selling color, or configuration you had to have that wouldnt sell well  like you wanted all the options on a car except a cigarette lighter, you get the idea. 99.99 of the time a good enough truck is available. Deposits are BS. They dont setup any kind of real contract, notice most of the time they want a check. Because holding on to a check is about as binding as making you wear a chicken suit to get a rebate. All it is, is a test to see if you will go through with signing the deal. As an example of why you dont let time pass on a car deal is shown in this. One time we had a couple want us to find a Cadillac Escalade Hybrid in red with every available option. Total cost was about 8590k. Only two new Red Escalade hybrids were for sale in the country at the time, one was in New York, and the other was in San Fransisco, and our dealership is in Texas, and neither was wanting to trade with us, so we ended up having to buy the SUV from one of the other dealerships inventory. That is a very rare thing to do by the way. We took a 25 down payment, around 20,000, in a check. We flew a driver to wherever the SUV was and then drove it back to Texas about 4 days later. The couple came back and hated the color, they would not take the SUV. The General Manager was pissed, he spent around 1000 just to bring the thing to Texas, not to mention he had to buy the thing. The couple walked and there was nothing the sales manager, GM, or salesman could do. We had not been able to deliver the car, and ultimately the dealership ate the loss, but it shows that deposits are useless. You cant sell something you dont own, and dealerships know it. Long story short, you cant claim a damage you never experienced. Not having something happen that you wanted to have happen is not a damage because you cant show a real economic loss. One other thing, When you sign the paperwork that you thought was an application, it was an authorization for them to pull your credit and the fine print at the bottom is boiler plate defense against getting sued for everything imaginable. Ours took up about half of one page and all of the back of the second page.

What form would I need to submit for the same ? I am assuming this form has to be issued by IT Dept in India or the employer in India ? The IRS doesnt require you to submit your Indian tax return with your US tax return, however they may ask for it later if your US tax return comes under examination. Generally, you claim foreign tax credits using form 1116 attached to your tax return. Specifically for India there may also be some clause in the IndoUS tax treaty that might be relevant to you. Treaty claims are made using form 8833 attached to your tax return, and I suggest having a professional EACPA licensed in your State prepare such a return. Although no stock transactions were done last year, should I still declare the value of total stocks I own ? If so what is an approx. tax rate or the maximum tax rate. Yes, this is done using form 8938 attached to your tax return and also form 114 FBAR filed separately with FinCEN. Pay attention the forms are very similar with regard to the information you provide on them, but they go to different agencies and have different filing requirements and penalties for noncompliance. As to tax rates  that depends on the types of stocks and how you decide to treat them. Generally, the tax rate for PFIC is very high, so that if any of your stocks are classified as PFIC  youd better talk to a professional tax adviser EACPA licensed in your State about how to deal with them. NonPFIC stocks are dealt with the same as if they were in the US, unless you match certain criteria described in the instructions to form 5471 then a different set of rules apply, talk to a licensed tax adviser. I will be transferring most of my stock to my father this year, will this need to be declared ? Yes, using form 709. Gift tax may be due. Talk to a licensed tax adviser EACPA licensed in your State. I have an apartment in India this year, will this need to be declared or only when I sell the same later on ? If theres no income from it  then no assuming you own it directly in your own name, for indirect ownership  yes, you do, but when you sell you will have to declare the sale and pay tax on the gains. Again, treaty may come into play, talk to a tax adviser. Also, be aware of Section 121 exclusion which may make it more beneficial for you to sell earlier.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: US tax returns for a resident  No US income and indian shares?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Taking out a loan to pay down a mortgage,"Youre not crazy, but the banks are. Heres the problem Youre taking 100 LTV on property A  you wont be able to get a second mortgage for more than 80 total including the current mortgage LTV. Thats actually something I just recently learned from my own experience. If the market is bad, the banks might even lower the LTV limit further. So essentially, at least 20 of your equity in A will remain on the paper. Banks dont like seeing the downpayment coming from anywhere other than your savings. Putting the downpayment from loan proceeds, even if not secured by the property which youre refinancing, will probably scare banks off. How to solve this? Suggest to deal with it as a business, putting both properties under a companyLLC, if possible. It might be hard to change the titles while you have loans on your properties, but even without it  deal with it as if it is a business. Approach your bank for a business loan  either secured by A or unsecured, and another investment loan for B. Describe your strategy to the banker preferably a small community bank in the area where the properties are, and how youre going to fund the properties. You wont get rates as low as you have on A 3.25 on investment loan?

The USA tax system as explained by JoeTaxpayer increases the risk. So you have a person being very logical and selling stocks that they believe will go up in value by more than any other investment they could have. It is called risk control.

Why do financial institutions charge so much to convert currency?,"Why do these fees exist? From a Banks point of view, they are operating in Currency A Currency B is a commodity [similar to Oil, Grains, Goods, etc]. So they will only buy if they can sell it at a margin. Currency Conversion have inherent risks, on small amount, the Bank generally does not hedge these risks as it is expensive but balances the position end of day or if the exposure becomes large. The rate they may get then may be different and the margin covers it. Hence on highly traded currency pairs the spread is less. Are there backend processes and requirements that require financial institutions to pass off the loss to consumers as a fee? The processes are to ensure bank does not make loss. is it just to make money on the convenience of international transactions? Banks do make money on such transactions however they also take some risks. The Forex market is not single market, but is a collective hybrid market place. There are costs a bank incurs to carry and square off positions and some of it is reflected in fees. If you see some of the remittance corridors, banks have optimized a remittance service say USD to INR, there is a huge flow often in small amounts. The remittance service aggregates such amounts to make it a large amount to get a better deal for themselves and passes on the benefits to individuals. Such volume of scale is not available for other pairs  corridors.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do financial institutions charge so much to convert currency?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Home owners association for houses, procons","I think it depends a lot on your idea of how you should relate to your neighbors. Personally, I think that I should be allowed to do just about whatever I want with my property, and I grant my neighbor the same right. If my neighbor wants to paint his house purple with orange stripes and fill his front lawn with pink flamingos, I think thats his right. If I dont like it, I dont have to look at his house. I would draw the line at things that I cannot avoid by simply looking the other way, like running jet engines in his back yard at 2 in the morning, as I could not avoid the noise. Or dumping toxic waste on the street, as it will cause health problems. Etc. Others think it IS their business what their neighbor does with his property and want to be able to control it. They want someone who has the authority to force everyone in the neighborhood to paint their house in colors deemed acceptable, to meet certain requirements for yard work. And thats what Home Owners Associations are for to require that everyone in the neighborhood maintain their property according to a standard set by the HOA, which should theoretically represent the wishes of the majority. Of course the price you pay for giving you the right to tell your neighbor what kind of fence he is allowed to have is that now your neighbors can tell you what kind of fence you can have. Advocates of HOAs often say that they are necessary to protect property values. Personally I think this is something of a circular argument I must have the right to prevent my neighbor from doing something that, in my opinion, makes his house ugly, not because I necessarily have no choice but to stare out my window at his house all day and be repulsed by it, but because someday I may want to sell my house to someone who will have no choice but to stare out the window at his house all day and be repulsed by it and so will not want to buy my house. Of course if we all just minded our own business, this wouldnt be an issue.

What does inflation mean to me?,"The general discussion of inflation centers on money as a medium of exchange and a store of value. It is impossible to discuss inflation without considering time, since it is a comparison between the balance between money and goods at two points in time. The whole point of using money, rather than bartering goods, is to have a medium of exchange. Having money, you are interested in the buying power of the money in general more than the relative price of a specific commodity. If some supply distortion causes a shortage of tobacco, or gasoline, or rental properties, the price of each will go up. However, if the amount of circulating money is doubled, the price of everything will be bid up because there is more money chasing the same amount of wealth. The persons who get to introduce the additional circulating money will win at the expense of those who already hold cash. Most of the public measures that are used to describe the economy are highly suspect. For example, during the 90s, the federal government ceased using a constant market basket when computing CPI, allowing substitutions. With this, it was no longer possible to make consistent comparisons over time. The socalled Core CPI is even worse, as it excludes food and energy, which is fine provided you dont eat anything or use any energy. Therefore, when discussing CPI, it is important to understand what exactly is being measured and how.

Both Conventional Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage loans and Government loans such as FHA and VA require that you have a minimum number of reporting trade lines that are active or have been active within the most recent 24 month period of time. An example of meeting the mortgage loan requirement is having a revolving account credit card that has been reporting activity for the past 24 months plus 2 other trade lines that have had activity reported for 12 months each, both within the past 24 months.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is 0 credit card utilization worse than 120 credit card utilization for any reason other than pure statistics?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is the gross amount of US debt dangerous for the small investor?,"Not a lot, directly. Your biggest direct risk is that you could buy the debt, and buy it at too high a price i.e. too low an interest rate and not make as much money as you ought and maybe not enough to cover inflation, especially if you buy longterm bonds at low interest rates. The indirect risks are mostly that the debt could weigh on economic growth There is also a question of monetary policy, inflation, and interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. Theoretically the government could be tempted to keep interest rates low to save money and buy its own bonds ""printing money"", which could cause inflation. Theoretically, they shouldnt, as price stability is one of the Feds primary mandates. But if they did, inflation makes everything less predictable and is generally obnoxious, which makes everything more risky and drags on the economy. Also, if the nominal value of an asset rises due to inflation, you will likely need to pay taxes on that at some point if you sell it, even though its real value is the same.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."

Diversify or keep current stock to increase capital gains,"The biggest challenge with owning any individual stock is price fluctuation, which is called risk. The scenarios you describe assume that the stock behaves exactly as you predict priceportfolio doubles and you need to consider risk. One way to measure risk in a stock or in a portfolio is Sharpe Ratio risk adjusted return, or the related Sortino ratio. One piece of advice that is often offered to individual investors is to diversify, and the stated reason for diversification is to reduce risk. But that is not telling the whole story. When you are able to identify stocks that are not price correlated, you can construct a portfolio that reduces risk. You are trying to avoid 10 tax on the stock grant 2515, but need to accept significant risk to avoid the 10 differential tax 1000. An alternative to a single stock is to invest in an ETF much lower risk, which you can buy and hold for a long time, and the pricegrowth of an ETF ex. SPY can be charted versus your stock to visualize the difference in growthfluctuation. Look up the beta volatility of your stock compared to SPY for example, IBM. Compare the beta of IBM and TSLA and note that you may accept higher volatility when you invest in a stock like Tesla over IBM. What is the beta of your stock? And how willing are you to accept that risk? When you can identify stocks that move in opposite directions, and mix your portfolio look up beta balanced portolio, you can smooth out the variability reduce the risk, although you may reduce your absolute return. This cannot be done with a single stock, but if you have more money to invest you could compose the rest of your portfolio to balance the risk for this stock grant, keep the grant shares, and still effectively manage risk. Some years ago I had accumulated over 10,000 shares grants, options in a company where I worked. During the time I worked there, their price varied between 30share and  1share.

What happens after a counterparty defaults on a derivative trade?,"The answer is in your question derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract. If the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will, in the first instance be billed by any intermediary Prime Broker etc. that facilitated the contract. If they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can ""net off"" any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins. The contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can, but dont need to, report a default such that this is to credit agencies in some jurisdictions they are required to by law. Any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment. If there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved the party to the trade and any intermediaries can sue for breach of contract. If they win which would be expected the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including, but not limited to, seizure of assets, enforced bankruptcy, and prison terms for any contempts of court rulings. All of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses as Argentina did in the early 20th century but in that case it may escalate as far as war. It has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as I know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict. As well as the ""hard"" results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further. Potential employees and funders will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit. The end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees. Most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well. edit netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a partys cash flows, positive and negative, are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances, for example company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3M  500k  3.5M and total incomings are 1.2M  1.1M  1.2M  3.5M so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into company1s account of 0.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What happens after a counterparty defaults on a derivative trade?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Using property to achieve financial independence,"I wrote this in another thread but is also applicable here. In general people make some key mistakes with property Not factoring in depreciation properly. Houses are perpetually falling down, and if you are renting them perpetually being trashed by the tenants as well  particularly in bad areas. Accurate depreciation costs can often run in the 520 range per year depending on the propertyarea. Add insurance to this as well or be prepared to lose the whole thing in a disaster. Related to 1, they take the index price of house price rises as something they can achieve, when in reality a lot of the house price rise is just everyone having to spend a lot of money keeping them standing up. No investor can actually track a house price graph due to 1 so be careful to make reasonable assumptions about actual achievable future growth in your example, they could well be lagging inflationbarely growing if you are not pricing in upkeep and depreciation properly. Failure to price in the huge transaction costs often 5 per sale and capital gainsother taxes depends on the exact tax structure where you are. These add up very fast if you are buying and selling at all frequently. Costs in either time or fees to real estate rental agents. Having to fill, check, evict, fix and maintain rental properties is a lot more work than most people realise, and you either have to pay this in your own time or someone elses. Again, has to be factored in. Liquidity issues. Selling houses in down markets is very, very hard. They are not like stocks where they can be moved quickly. Houses can often sit on the market for years before sale if you are not prepared to take low prices. As the bank owns your house if you fail to pay the mortgage rents collapse, loss of job etc they can force you to fire sale it leaving you in a whole world of pain depending on the exact legal system negative equity etc. These factors are generally correlated if you work in the same cities you are buying in so quite a lot of potential long tail risk if the regional economy collapses. Finally, if youre young they can tie you to areas where your earnings potential is limited. Renting can be immensely beneficial early on in a career as it gives you huge freedom to up sticks and leave fast when new opportunities arise. Locking yourself into 20 yr contractslandlord activities when young can be hugely inhibiting to your earnings potential. Without more details on the exact legal framework, area, house type etc its hard to give more specific advise, but in general you need a very large margin of safety with property due to all of the above, so if the numbers youre running are coming out close and they are here, its probably not worth it, and youre better of sticking with more hands off investments like stocks and bonds.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Using property to achieve financial independence?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

The cost of to your friends of setting up the mortgage will be less than the opulent interest they are offering you, and you will both have peace of mind. Even if the sale of the old house falls through, you will still be its mortgagee and still assured of repayment on any future sale or even inheritance.

How can I predict which way mortgage rates are moving?,"Mortgage rates generally consist of two factors The risk premium is relatively constant for a particular individual  house combination, so most of the changes in your mortgage rate will be associated with changes in the price of money in the world economy at large. Interest rates in the overall economy are usually tied to an interest rate called the Federal Funds rate. The Federal Reserve manipulates the federal funds rate by buying andor selling bonds until the rate is something they like. So you can usually expect your interest rate to rise or fall depending on the policies of the Federal Reserve. You can predict this in a couple of ways The way they have described their plans recently indicates that will keep interest rates low for an extended period of time  probably through 2014 or so  and they hope to keep inflation around 2. Unless inflation is significantly more than 2 between now and then, they are extremely unlikely to change that plan. As such, you should probably not expect mortgage interest rates in general to change more than infinitesimally small amounts until 2014ish.

Would I ever need credit card if my debit card is issued by MasterCardVisa?,"Credit cards are often more fool proof, against overdrawing. Consider Bill has solid cash flow, but most of their money is in his high interest savings account earning interest  an account that doesnt have a card, but is accessible via online banking. Bill keeps enough in the debit transactions account for regular spending, much of which comes out automatically E.g. rent, utilities, some of which he spends as needed eg shopping, lunch. On top of the day to day money Bill keeps an overhead amount, so if something happens he doesnt overdraw the account  which would incur significant fees. Now oneday Bill sees that the giant flatscreen TV he has been saving for is on clearence sale  half price!, and there is just one left. It costs more than he would normally spend in a week  much more. But Bill knows that his pay should have just gone in, and his rent not yet come out. Plus the overhead he keep in the account . So there is money in his debit account. When he gets home he can open up online banking and transfer from his savings After all the TV is what he was saving for What Bill forgets is that there was a public holiday last week in the state where payroll is operated, and that his pay is going to go in a day late. So now he might have over drawn the account buying the TV, or maybe that was fine, but paying the rent over draws the account. Now he has a overdraft fee, probably on the order of 50. Most banks at least where I am, will happily allow you to overdraw you account. Giving you a loan, at high interest and with an immediate overdraft fee. They do this cos the fee is so high that they can tolerate the risk of the nonassessed loan. Sometimes if you ask they dont let you do it with your own transcations eg buying the TV, but they do let you do it on automated payements eg the Rent. On the other hand banks will not let you over draw a credit card. They know exactly how much loan and risk they were going to take. If Bill had most of his transactions going on his credit card, then it would have just bounced at the cash register, and Bill would have remembered what was going on and then transferred the money.

Is it bad etiquette to use a credit or debit card to pay for single figure amounts at the POS,"Intellectually and logically, it shouldnt bother me for a second to charge something for a buck. Its a losing proposition for the merchant, but their immediate business costs should be of little concern to me. Theyre making a choice to sell that item to me at that price and by accepting that means of payment, right? but the more I charge as opposed to paying cash, the more cash back I get. In my oldish age, Ive gotten a little softer and will pay cash more often for smaller amounts because I understand the business costs, but its not a matter of caring what other people think. Accepting credit cards, or not, is a business decision. Its usually a good one. But with that decision come the rules, which up until about a year ago, meant that merchants couldnt set a minimum charge amount. Now thats not the case merchant account providers can no longer demand that their merchant clients accept all charges, though they are allowed to set a minimum amount that is no lower than 10.00.

What does a CFP do?,"A Certified Financial Planner has passed a licensing exam and will advise you and help you reach your financial goals. A good CFP can help you a lot, especially if you are unsure how to set up your insurance, investment, savings, and financial plans on your own. You do not need a CFP to get a life insurance policy. If you do get a CFP, he or she should help you above and beyond life insurance  i.e. retirement planning, investment advice, education planning, etc. Its advantageous to you to pay a fixed price for services instead of a percentage or commission. Negotiate fees up front. For life insurance, in most cases a term policy will fit your needs. Whole life, universal life, etc., combine investments and life insurance into a single product and are big commission makers for the salesman. They make it sound like the best thing ever, so be aware. One of my rules of thumb is that, generally speaking, the larger the commission is for the salesperson, the worse the product is for the consumer. Welcome to life insurance pitches. Term life is far less expensive and provides a death benefit and nothing else. If you just had a baby and need to protect your family, for example, term life is often a good solution, easy to buy, and inexpensive.

which types of investments should be choosen for 401k at early 20s?,"The question you should be asking yourself is this ""Why am I putting money into a 401k?"" For many people, the answer is to grow a large nest egg and save for future retirement expenses. Investors are balancing risk and potential reward, so the asset categories youre putting your 401k contribution towards will be a reflection on how much risk youre willing to take. Per a US News  World Report article Ultimately, investors would do well to remember one of the key tenants of investing diversify. The narrower you are with your investments, the greater your risk, says Vanguards Bruno ""[Diversification] doesnt ensure against a loss, but it does help lessen a significant loss."" Generally, investing in your employers stock in your 401k is considered very risk. In fact, one Forbes columnist recommends not putting any money into company stock. FINRA notes Simply stated, if you put too many eggs in one basket, you can expose yourself to significant risk. In financial terms, you are underdiversified you have too much of your holdings tied to a single investmentyour companys stock. Investing heavily in company stock may seem like a good thing when your company and its stock are doing well. But many companies experience fluctuations in both operational performance and stock price. Not only do you expose yourself to the risk that the stock market as a whole could flounder, but you take on a lot of company risk, the risk that an individual firmyour companywill falter or fail. In simpler terms, if you invest a large portion of your 401k funds into company stock, if your company runs into trouble, you could lose both your job AND your retirement investments. For the other investment assetsvehicles, you should review a few things Personally, I prefer to keep my portfolio simple and just pick just a few options based on my own risk tolerance. From your fund examples, without knowing specifics about your financial situation and risk tolerance, I would have created a portfolio that looks like this when I was in my 20s I avoided the bond and incomemoney market funds because the growth potential is too low for my investing horizon.

"Why invest for the longterm rather than buy and sell for quick, big gains?","There are people well, companies who make money doing roughly what you describe, but not exactly. Theyre called ""market makers"". Their value for X is somewhere on the scale of 1 that is to say a scale at which almost everything is ""volatile"", but they use leverage, shorting and hedging to complicate things to the point where its nothing like a simple as making a 1 profit every time they trade. Their actions tend to reduce volatility and increase liquidity. The reason you cant do this is that you dont have enough capital to do what market makers do, and you dont receive any advantages that the exchange might offer to official market makers in return for them contracting to always make both buy bids and sell offers at different prices, hence the ""bidoffer spread"". They have to be able to cover large shortterm losses on individual stocks, but when the stock doesnt move too much they do make profits from the spread. The reason you cant just buy a lot of volatile stocks ""assuming I dont make too many poor choices"", is that the reason the stocks are volatile is that nobody knows which ones are the good choices and which ones are the poor choices. So if you buy volatile stocks then you will buy a bunch of losers, so whats your strategy for ensuring there arent ""too many""? Supposing that youre going to hold 10 stocks, with 10 of your money in each, what do you do the first time all 10 of them fall the day after you bought them? Or maybe not all 10, but suppose 75 of your holdings give no impression that theyre going to hit your target any time soon. Do you just sit tight and stop trading until one of them hits your X target in which case you start to look a little bit more like a longterm investor after all, or are you tempted to change your strategy as the months and years roll by? If you will eventually sell things at a loss to make cash available for new trades, then you cannot assess your strategy ""as if"" you always make an X gain, since that isnt true. If you dont ever sell at a loss, then youll inevitably sometimes have no cash to trade with through picking losers. The big practical question then is when that state of affairs persists, for how long, and whether its in force when you want to spend the money on something other than investing. So sure, if you used a shortterm time machine to know in advance which volatile stocks are the good ones today, then it would be more profitable to daytrade those than it would be to invest for the long term. Investing on the assumption that youll only pick shortterm winners is basically the same as assuming you have that time machine  There are various strategies for analysing the market and trying to find ways to more modestly do what market makers do, which is to take profit from the inherent volatility of the market. The simple strategy you describe isnt complete and cannot be assessed since you dont say how to decide what to buy, but the selling strategy ""sell as soon as Ive made X but not otherwise"" can certainly be improved. If youre keen you can test a give strategy for yourself using historical share price data or current share price data run an imaginary account and see how youre doing in 12 months. When using historical data you have to be realistic about how youd choose what stocks to buy each day, or else youre just cheating at solitaire. When using current data you have to beware that there might not be a major market slump in the next 12 months, in which case you wont know how your strategy performs under conditions that it inevitably will meet eventually if you run it for real. You also have to be sure in either case to factor in the transaction costs youd be paying, and the fact that youre buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price, you cant trade at the headline midmarket price. Finally, you have to consider that to do pure technical analysis as an individual, you are in effect competing against a bank thats camped on top of the exchange to get fastest possible access to trade, it has a supercomputer and a team of whizzkids, and its trying to find and extract the same opportunities you are. This is not to say the plucky underdog cant do well, but there are systematic reasons not to just assume you will.

"Is it better for a public company to increase its dividends, or institute a share buyback?","I feel dividends are better for shareholders. The idea behind buy backs is that future profits are split between fewer shares, thereby increasing the value not necessarily price  thats a market function of the remaining shares. This presupposes that the company then retires the shares it repurchases. But quite often buybacks simply offset dilution from stock option compensation programs. In my opinion, some stock option compensation is acceptable, but overuse of this becomes a form of wealth transfer  from the shareholder to management. The opposite of shareholder friendly! But lets assume the shares are being retired. Thats good, but at what cost? The company must use cashflow cash to pay for the shares. The buyback is only a positive for shareholders if the shares are undervalued. Managers can be very astute in their own sphere running their business. Estimating a reasonable range of intrinsic value for their shares is a difficult, and very subjective task, requiring many assumptions about future revenue and margins. A few managers, like Warren Buffett, are very competent capital allocators. But most managers arent that good in this area. And being so close to the company, theyre often overly optimistic. So they end up overpaying. If a companys shares are worth, say, 30, its not unreasonable to assume they may trade all around that number, maybe as low as 15, and as high as 50. This is overly simplistic, but assuming the value doesnt change  that the company is in steadystate mode, then the 30 point, the intrinsic value estimate, will act as a magnet for the market price. Eventually it regresses toward the value point. Well, if management doesnt understand this, they could easily pay 50 for the repurchased stock heck, companies routinely just continue buying stock, with no apparent regard for the price theyre paying. This is one of the quickest ways to vaporize shareholder capital overpaying for dubious acquisitions is another. Dividends, on the other hand, require no estimates. They cant mask other activities, other agendas. They dont transfer wealth from shareholders to management. US companies traditionally pay quarterly, and they try very hard not to cut the dividend. Many companies grow the dividend steadily, at a rate several times that of inflation. The dividend is an actual cash expenditure. Theres no GAAP reporting constructs to get in the way of whats really going on. The company must be fiscally conservative and responsible, or risk not having the cash when they need to pay it out. The shareholder gets the cash, and can then reinvest as heshe sees fit with available opportunities at the time, including buying more shares of the company, if undervalued. But if overvalued, the money can be invested in a better, safer opportunity.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is it better for a public company to increase its dividends, or institute a share buyback?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

How to fund sabbatical to prepare house for sale?,"Ill write this up as a more formal answer, here. Id suggest looking into a Home Equity Line of Credit, or HELOC. You didnt mention in your question how much equity you have in the home, but assuming at least 20, you might be able to open a HELOC with a line of 40,000. My experience is that you can do 50 of your equity, but depends on the bank. Here are a few notes that are generally in play with HELOCs YMMV, so be sure to know the specifics before signing on the line Doing this, at least when we did 8 years ago, did not subject us to PMI. There are certainly plenty of things to research, but it sounds like youre pretty astute based on how youre evaluating the financial side of this endeavor. There are no guarantees in real estate. Houses could be selling like crazy now, but in 6 months they might not. It certainly sounds like thats a lower risk in your area, but you never know what might happen.

Is my financial plan for buying a house logically sound,"As a rental, this is not an ideal set of numbers. You manage to show a 255 gain but 275 is from payment to principal. So, from the start, youre out 20wk. This ignores the 170K down payment, which has an opportunity cost, however you calculate it. You can assign the same rate as the mortgage, and its nearly 10Kyr. Or the rate you feel your choice of stock market or alternate investment would rise. Either way, you cant ignore this money. Your mortgage rate isnt fixed.

Should the poor consider investing as a means to becoming rich? ,"Definitions are in order These definitions are important. Someone making 1,000,000 a year who spends all of it is poor. Someone who makes 500K, spends 450K a year and has three million in stocks and a paidfor million dollar home may be rich but they cant retire. They need another seven to eight million to retire. Someone with a million dollars in assets who makes 40K a year through their job, can be Financially Independent and retire. This last example is important. In The Millionaire Next Door the authors share their discovery that the average millionaire accumulated their wealth with just a working income of around 50K the book is a bit dated so the number should be elevated if you adjust for inflation. Finance Independent is a strange thing to wrap your head around and people with high incomes often fall victim to misunderstanding it. When figuring out how much a person needs to accumulate for their ""nest egg"", their working income is not a direct variable. Their spending and savings rate are. A doctor making 500K, who spends 450K needs to work for 51 years if they are planning to keep spending 450Kyear adjusted for inflation forever. Someone making 60K starting at age 21 who saves 18K 30, could retire at 49. Someone with a truly low income and poor, say 30K and under and living in a old developed nation, investing will help them a bit. Say they save 10 of their income, by the time they reach 65 the typical age federal retirement pensions begin, theyll have enough money to live off of in perpetuity and in comfort.

"As a beginner investor, should I start investing with mutual funds through my bank, or with an online broker?","What is the best option to start with? and I am not sure about my goals right now but I do want to have a major retirement account without changing it for a long time That is a loaded question. Your goals should be set up first, else what is stopping you from playing the mega millions lottery to earn the retirement amount instantly. If you have the time and resources, you should try doing it yourself. It helps you learn and at a latter stage if you dont have the time to manage it yourself, you can find an adviser who does it for you. To find a good adviser or find a fund whowhich can help you achieve your monetary goals you will need to understand the details, how it works and other stuff, behind it. When you are thrown terms at your face by somebody, you should be able to join the dots and get a picture for yourself. Many a rich men have lost their money to unscrupulous people i.e. Bernie Madoff. So knowing helps a lot and then you can ask questions or find for yourself to calm yourself i.e. ditch the fund or adviser, when you see red flags. It also makes you not to be too greedy, when somebody paints you a picture of great returns, because then your well oiled mind would start questioning the rationale behind such investments. Have a look at Warren Buffet. He is an investor and you can follow how he does his investing. It is simple but very difficult to follow. Investing through my bank I would prefer to stay away from them, because their main service is banking and not allowing people to trade. I would first compare the services provided by a bank to TD Ameritrade, or any firm providing trading services. The thing is, as you mentioned in the question, you have to go through a specific process of calling him to change your portfolio, which shouldnt be a condition. What might happen is, if he is getting some benefits out of the arrangementget it clarified in the first place if you intend to go through them, from the side of the fund, he might try to dissuade you from doing so to protect his stream of income. And what if he is on a holiday or you cannot get hold of him. Secondly from your question, it seems you arent that investing literate. So it is very easy to get you confused by jargon and making you do what he gets the maximum benefit out of it, rather than which benefits you more. I aint saying he is doing so but that could be a possibility too, so you have consider that angle too. The pro is that setting up an account through them might be much easier than directly going to a provider. But the best point doing it yourself is, you will learn and there is nothing which tops that. You dont want somebody else managing your money, however knowledgeable they maybe i.e. Anthony Bolton.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: As a beginner investor, should I start investing with mutual funds through my bank, or with an online broker?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is it possible to make money by getting a mortgage?,"This answer is based on Australian tax, which is significantly different. I only offer it in case others want to compare situations. In Australia, a popular tax reduction technique is ""Negative Gearing"". Borrow from a bank, buy an investment property. If the income frome the new property is not enough to cover interest payments plus maintenance etc then the excess each year is a capital loss  which you claim each year, as an offset to your income ie. pay less tax.

A little later I made another purchase late at night on a different card. It went through, but when I tried to use the card the next day for something small in a store, it was declined.

They hadnt called me because it was late at night, and they hadnt given themselves any reasonable mechanisms to compensate for that like calling me the next morning, emailing me, or the like theyd just blocked the card.

"How to invest in gold at market value, i.e. without paying a markup?","And you have hit the nail on the head of holding gold as an alternative to liquid currency. There is simply no way to reliably buy and sell physical gold at the spot price unless you have millions of dollars. Exhibit A The stock symbol GLD is an ETF backed by gold.

Less than 100,000 shares? no physical gold for you. With GLDs share price being 155.55 this would mean you need to have over 15 million dollars, and be financially solvent enough to be willing to exchange the liquidity of shares and dollars for illiquid gold, that you wouldnt be able to sell at a fair price in smaller denominations. The ETF trades at a different price than the gold spot market, so you technically are dealing with a spread here too. Exhibit B The futures market. Accepting delivery of a gold futures contract also requires that you get 1000 units of the underlying asset. This means 1000 gold bars which are currently 1,610.70 each. This means you would need 1,610,700 that you would be comfortable with exchanging for gold bars, which In contrast, securitized gold gold in an ETF, for instance can be hedged very easily, and one can sell covered calls to negate transaction fees, hedge, and collect dividends from the fund. quickly recuperating any ""spread tax"" that you encounter from opening the position.

Previous owner of my home wants to buy it back but the propertys value is less than my loan what to do?,"I would tell the former owner that you will sell him the house for you current loan balance. He wants the home, he may be willing to pay what you owe. You cant really do a short sale unless you are behind on your payments. Banks only agree to a short sale when they think they are going to have to foreclose on the property. Not to mention a short sale is almost as bad as a foreclosure and will wreck your credit. If the former buying is not willing to buy the house for what you owe your only real option is to come up with the difference. If he offers you say 50K less than you owe, you will have to give the mortgage holder the remaining balance 50K in this example for them to release the property. Another problem you will face, if the former owner is willing to pay more than what the house is worth, and he is going to finance it, he will have to have enough cash to put down so that the loan amount is not more than the property is worth. Finally if none of that works you can just hold on to the property until the value comes up or you mortgage is payed down enough to make the balance of the mortgage less than the value of the house.

Do altcoin trades count as likekind exchanges? Deferred capital gains tax,"In June 2016 the American Institute of CPAs sent a letter to the IRS requesting guidance on this question. Quoting from section 4 of this letter, which is available at httpswww.aicpa.orgadvocacytaxdownloadabledocumentsaicpacommentletteronnotice201421virtualcurrency61016.pdf If the IRS believes any property transaction rules should apply differently to virtual currency than to other types of property, taxpayers will need additional guidance in order to properly distinguish the rules and regulations. Section 4, QA1 of Notice 201421 states that general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency, which is guidance that is generally helpful in determining the tax consequences of most virtual currency transactions. However, if there are particular factors that distinguish one virtual currency as likekind to another virtual currency for section 1031 purposes, the IRS should clarify these details e.g., allowing the treatment of virtual currency held for investment or business as likekind to another virtual currency in the form of published guidance. Similarly, taxpayers need specific guidance of special rules or statutory interpretations if the IRS determines that the installment method of section 453 is applied differently for virtual currency than for other types of property. So, at the very least, a peerreviewed committee of CPAs finds likekind treatment to have possible grounds for allowance. I would disagree with calling this a ""loophole,"" however edit at least from the viewpoint of the taxpayer. At a base technological level, a virtual currencytovirtual currency exchange consists of exchanging knowledge of one sequence of binary digits private key for another.

"Why invest for the longterm rather than buy and sell for quick, big gains?","The stock markets principal justification is matching investors with investment opportunities. Thats only reasonably feasible with longterm investments. High frequency traders are not interested in investments, they are interested in buying cheap and selling expensive. Holding reasonably robust shares for longer binds their capital which is one reason the fasterpaced business of dealing with options is popular instead. So their main manner of operation is leeching off actually occuring investments by letting the investors pay more than the recipients of the investments receive. By now, the majority of stock market business is indirect and tries guessing where the money goes rather than where the business goes. For one thing, this leads to the stock markets evaluations being largely inflated over the actual underlying committed deals happening. And as the commitment to an investment becomes rare, the market becomes more volatile and instable its money running in circles. Fast trading is about running in front of where the money goes, anticipating the market. But if there is no actual market to anticipate, only people running before the imagination of other people running before money, the net payout converges to zero as the ratio of serious actual investments in tangible targets declines. By and large, high frequency trading converges to a Ponzi scheme, and you try being among the winners of such a scheme. But there are a whole lot of people competing here, and essentially the net payoff is close to zero due to the large volumes in circulation as opposed to what ends up in actual tangible investments. Its a completely different game with different rules riding on the original idea of a stock market.

Leveraged Forex trading can be downright speculative. Im curious how you arrived at the 96 success ratio. As Jason R has pointed out, 12 trades a year for 7 years would only give you 714 trades. In order to get a success rate of 96 you would have had to successful exploit this ""irregularity"" at 24 out of 25 times. I recommend you proceed cautiously. Make the transition from a paper trader to a profitseeking trader slowly.

What is the economic explanation for the high cost of weddings?,"There is the price they want and the price you pay. Everything is negotiable when its a service always possible, but usually harder with actual ""goods"". You should always haggle and price match your vendors. You can also try going to different vendors and not telling them its for a wedding and see if there really is a price difference. For example, call up a florist and say you need X, Y, and Z for a corporate banquet or for a special event for which you cannot give the details. If you then tell them its actually a wedding, and they blindly raise it without a good justification, move on. That said, they jack up the price because they know most people will says ""its my wedding"", ""its once in a lifetime"", ""its MY special day"", etc.... The same is true about diamonds, their price does not reflect the actual supply and demand ratio, just the perception that has been created. However, as mentioned in some of the comments above, the service provided at a wedding may be different or more involved than just a normal dinner The more important issue is ensuring there are no back fees, no hidden fees, and you have well written, well reviewed contracts. For example, we know a couple whose caterer added a mandatory 20 gratuity, regardless of the service which was provided. Most venues or restaurants will not be making the bar a loseleader, but they will charge for other things. You can also save money by buying used or looking on ebay for prices closer to wholesale for the product.

"A guy scammed me, but he gave me a bank account number  routing number. Can I use that to take out what he owes me?","Youre potentially in very deep water here. You dont know who this person is that youre dealing with. Before youd even met him, he just gave you his banking info, seemingly without a second thought. You have no idea what the sources of his money are, so what happens if the money is stolen or otherwise illegal? If it is determined that you used any of that money, youll be on the hook to return it, at the very least. Who knows what the legal ramifications are either? So it sounds like you began spending his money before you had any kind of written agreement in place? Doesnt that seem odd to you to have someone just so trusting as to not even ask for that? Was the source of the email about the 2500 from PayPal, or from him or his advisor? PayPal always sends you a notice directly when funds are received into your account, and even if they were going to put a temporary hold on them for whatever reason sometimes they do that, it would still show up in your account. I would HIGHLY can I be more emphatic? advise you not to go anywhere NEAR his bank account until or unless you can absolutely verify who he is, where his money comes from, and what the situation is. If you start dipping into his account, whether you think youre somehow entitled to the money or not, he could cry foul and have you arrested for theft. This is a very odd situation, and for someone who says hes normally cautious and skeptical, you sure let your guard down here when you started spending his money without making any serious effort to confirm his bona fides.

You need to step back, take a deep breath, stop using his money, and contact a lawyer for advice. Every attorney will give you a free consultation, and you need to protect yourself here.

"In general, is it financially better to buy or to rent a house?","I just read through all of the answers to this question and there is an important point that no one has mentioned yet Oftentimes, buying a house is actually cheaper than renting the identical house. Im looking around my area suburbs of Chicago, IL in 2017 and seeing some houses that are both for sale and for rent, which makes for an easy comparison. If I buy the house with 0 down you cant actually put 0 down but it makes the numerical comparison more accurate if you do, my monthly payment including mortgage PI, taxes, insurance, and HOA, is still 400 less than the monthly rent payment. If I put 20 down its an even bigger savings. So, in addition to the the tax advantages of owning a home, the locked in price that helps you in an economy that experiences inflation, and the accumulated equity, you may even have extra cash flow too.

How to read a mutual fund spec sheet?,"It says expense ratio of 0.14. What does it mean? Essentially it means that they will take 0.14 of your money, regardless of the performance. This measures how much money the fund spends out of its assets on the regular management expenses. How much taxes will I be subject to This depends on your personal situation, not much to do with the fund though investmentrebalancing policies may affect the taxable distributions. If you hold it in your IRA  there will be no taxes at all. However, some funds do have measures of nontaxable distributions vs dividends vs. capital gains. Not all the funds do that, and these are very rough estimates anyway. What is considered to be a reasonable expense ratio? That depends greatly on the investment policy. For passive index funds, 0.050.5 is a reasonable range, while for actively managed funds it can go up as much as 2 and higher.

How does my broker optionsXpress calculate probabilities that the stock will hit a certain price?,"This chart concerns an option contract, not a stock. The method of analysis is to assume that the price of an option contract is normally distributed around some mean which is presumably the current price of the underlying asset. As the date of expiration of the contract gets closer the variation around the mean in the possible end price for the contract will decrease. Undoubtedly the publisher has measured typical deviations from the mean as a function of time until expiration from historical data. Based on this data, the program that computes the probability has the following inputs 1 the mean current asset price 2 the time until expiration 3 the expected standard deviation based on 2 With this information the probability distribution that you see is generated the green hump. This is a ""normal"" or Gaussian distribution. For a normal distribution the probability of a particular event is equal to the area under the curve to the right of the value line in the example above the value chosen is 122.49. This area can be computed with the formula This formula is called the probability density for x, where x is the value 122.49 in the example above. Tau T is the reciprocal of the variance which can be computed from the standard deviation. Mu  is the mean. The main assumption such a calculation makes is that the price of the asset will not change between now and the time of expiration. Obviously that is not true in most cases because the prices of stocks and bonds constantly fluctuate. A secondary assumption is that the distribution of the option price around the mean will a normal or Gaussian distribution. This is obviously a crude assumption and common sense would suggest it is not the most accurate distribution. In fact, various studies have shown that the Burr Distribution is actually a more accurate model for the distribution of option contract prices.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does my broker optionsXpress calculate probabilities that the stock will hit a certain price?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Help Understanding MarketLimit Orders and BidAsk Price,"Your logic breaks down because you assume that you are the only market participant on your side of the book and that the participant on the other side of the book has entered a market order. Heres what mostly happens Large banks and brokerages trading with their own money we call it proprietary or ""prop"" trading will have a number of limit and other, more exotic orders sitting on both sides of the trading book waiting to buy or sell at a price that they feel is advantageous. Some of these orders will have sat on the book for many months if not years. These alone are likely to prevent your limit orders executing as they are older so will be hit first even if they arent at a better price. On more liquid stocks there will also be a number of participants entering market orders on both sides of the book whose orders are matched up before limit orders are matched with any market orders. This means that pairing of market orders, at a better price, will prevent your limit order executing. In many markets high frequency traders looking for arbitrage opportunities for example will enter a few thousand orders a minute, some of these will be limit orders just off touch, others will be market orders to be immediately executed. The likelihood that your limit order, being as it is posited way off touch, is hit with all those traders about is minimal. On less liquid stocks there are market makers large institutional traders who effectively set the bid and offer prices by being willing to provide liquidity and fill the market orders at a temporary loss to themselves and will, in most cases, have limit orders set to provide this liquidity that will be close to touch. They are paid to do this by the exchange and interdealer brokers through their fees structure. They will fill the market orders that would hit your limit if they think that it would provide more liquidity in such a way that it fulfils their obligations. Only if there are no other participants looking to trade on the instrument at a better price than your limit which, of course they can see unless you enter it into a dark pool AND there is a market order on the opposite side of the book will your limit order be instantaneously be hit, executed, and move the market price.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Help Understanding MarketLimit Orders and BidAsk Price?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Connection between gambling and trading on stockoptionsForex markets,"I think that the answer by jkuz is good. Id add that the theres a mathematically precise difference Gambling games are typically ""zerosum"" games, which means that every dollar won by one person is lost by another. If theres a ""house"" taking a cut then its worse than zerosum, but lets ignore that for the moment. None of the markets that you mentioned are zerosum because its possible for both parties in the transaction to ""win"" since they typically have different objectives. If I buy stock, I typically desire for it to go up to make money, but, if I sell stock, I typically sell it because I want the money to do something else completely. The ""something else"" might be invest in another instrument if I think its better or Im rebalancing risk. It might also be to buy a house, pay for college, or if Im in retirement living on my investments to buy food. If the stock goes up, the buyer won increased investment but the seller also won got the ""other thing"" that they wantedneeded, which they would not have been able to get had there not been a buyer willing to pay cash for the stock.

Is avoiding fees commonly found with CFD trading possible?,"The fees with trading CFDs are usually lower than standard share trading. There is usually no joining fee to join a broker and start trading with them, you must be talking about the minimum required to fund your account to trade with. What country are you in? Because if you are in the USA I believe CFD trading is not allowed there. Also there is no margin fee associated with trading CFDs. The margin is what you put in to buy or sell the CFD when you open a position. For example if you were to open a position in a share CFD where the underlying share had a price of 10 and you were looking to buy 1000 units. To buy the shares outright your outlay would be 10000 plus brokerage. If the CFD provider had a 10 margin on these share, then your initial margin to open a CFD position would be 10 of 10000 or 1000. If the price of the shares went up to 11 and you sold the shares you would get 11000 1000 profit, if you sold the CFDs you would get 2000 1000 profit. If on the other hand the shares went down to 9 and you sold the shares you would get 9000 1000 loss, if you sold the CFDs you would get 0 1000 loss. You have to be careful with margin, it is a two edged sword  it can multiply your gains as well as multiply your losses. The only fees you should be charged with CFDs is brokerage which should be less than for share trading, and overnight financing costs. This is charged for everyday you hold a long position overnight. You should not be charge any overnight financing cost for holding short positions overnight, and if interest rates were higher you might actually get paid an overnight financing for holding short positions overnight. You may have been closed out of your bitcoin position because you didnt have enough funds in your trading account to open the size trade that you opened. From your question it seems like you are not ready to trade CFDs, you should really learn more about CFDs and the trading platforms you plan to use before trading with your valuable money. You could probably open up a simulation account whilst you are learning the ropes and become more familiar with the trading platform and with CFDs. And if you are not sure about something ask your broker, they usually have training videos and seminars.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is avoiding fees commonly found with CFD trading possible?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What does it mean if IPOs  normally are sold with an underwriting discount a built in commission,"Also, in the next sentence, what is buyers commission? Is it referring to the share holder? Or potential share holder? And why does the buyer get commission? The buyer doesnt get a commission. The buyer pays a commission. So normally a buyer would say, ""I want to buy a hundred shares at 20."" The broker would then charge the buyer a commission. Assuming 4, the commission would be So the total cost to the buyer is 2080 and the seller receives 2000. The buyer paid a commission of 80 as the buyers commission. In the case of an IPO, the seller often pays the commission. So the buyer might pay 2000 for a hundred shares which have a 7 commission. The brokering agent or agents may share pockets a commission of 140. Total paid to the seller is 1860. Some might argue that the buyer pays either way, as the seller receives money in the transaction. Thats a reasonable outlook. A better way to say this might be that typical trades bill the buyer directly for commission while IPO purchases bill the seller. In the typical trade, the buyer negotiates the commission with the broker. In an IPO, the seller does with the underwriter. Another issue with an IPO is that there are more parties getting commission than just one. As a general rule, you still call your broker to purchase the stock. The broker still expects a commission. But the IPO underwriter also expects a commission. So the 7 commission might be split between the IPO underwriter works for the selling company and the broker works for the buyer. The broker has more work to do than normal. They have to put in the buyers purchase request and manage the price negotiation. In most purchases, you just say something like ""I want to offer 20 a share"" or ""I want to purchase at the market price."" In an IPO, they may increase the price, asking for 25 a share. And they may do that multiple times. Your broker has to come back to you each time and get a new authorization at the higher price. And you still might not get the number of shares that you requested. Beyond all this, you may still be better off buying an IPO than waiting until the next day. Sure, you pay more commission, but you also may be buying at a lower price. If the IPO price is 20 but the price climbs to 30, you would have been better off paying the IPO price even with the higher commission. However, if the IPO price is 20 and the price falls to 19.20, youd be better off buying at 19.20 after the IPO. Even though in that case, youd pay the 4 commission on top of the 19.20, so about 19.97. I think that the overall point of the passage is that the IPO underwriter makes the most money by convincing you to pay as high an IPO price as possible. And once they do that, theyre out of the picture. Your broker will still be your broker later. So the IPO underwriter has a lot of incentive to encourage you to participate in the IPO instead of waiting until the next day. The broker doesnt care much either way. They want you to buy and sell something. The IPO or something else. They dont care much as to what. The underwriter may overprice the stock, as that maximizes their return. If they can convince enough people to overpay, they dont care that the stock falls the day after that. All their marketing effort is to try to achieve that result. They want you to believe that your 20 purchase will go up to 30 the next day. But it might not. These numbers may not be accurate. Obviously the 20 stock price is made up. But the 4 and 7 numbers may also be inaccurate. Modern online brokers are very competitive and may charge a flat fee rather than a percentage. The book may be giving you older numbers that were correct in 1983 or whatever year. The buyers commission could also be lower than 4, as the seller also may be charged a commission. If each pays 2, thats about 4 total but split between a buyers commission and a sellers commission.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What does it mean if IPOs  normally are sold with an underwriting discount a built in commission?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Creating a Limited company while still fully employed,"I was just thinking ahead, can I apply for Limited company now, while fully time employed, and not take any business until I get a contract.

If you claim VAT that has also to be paid after you register for VAT. VAT registration is another registration different from opening a limited company. Is it the same if I decided to take a 1,2 or x month holiday and the company again will not incur any turnover? Turnover is year end, so at the year end you have to submit your yearly results, whether you took a 12 month holiday or a weeks holiday.

Refinance when going to sell?,"When evaluating a refinance, it all comes down to the payback. Refinancing costs money in closing costs. There are different reasons for refinancing, and they all have different methods for calculating payback. One reason to finance is to get a lower interest rate. When determining the payback time, you calculate how long it would take to recover your closing costs with the amount you save in interest. For example, if the closing costs are 2,000, your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one. The longer you hold the mortgage after you refinance, the more money you save in interest with the new rate. Generally, it doesnt pay to refinance to a lower rate right before you sell, because you arent holding the mortgage long enough to see the interest savings. You seem to be 3 years away from selling, so you might be able to see some savings here in the next three years. A second reason people refinance is to lower their monthly payment if they are having trouble paying it. I see you are considering switching from a 15 year to a 30 year is one of your goals to reduce your monthly payment? By refinancing to a 30 year, youll be paying a lot of interest in your first few years of payments, extending the payback time of your lower interest rate. A third reason people refinance is to pull cash out of their equity. This applies to you as well. Since you are planning on using it to remodel the home you are trying to sell, you have to ask yourself if the renovations you are planning will payoff in the increased sale price of your home. Often, renovations dont increase the value of their home as much as they cost. You do renovations because you will enjoy living in the renovated home, and you get some of your money back when you sell. But sometimes you can increase the value of your home by enough to cover the cost of the renovation. Talk to a real estate agent in your area to get their advice on how much the renovations you are talking about will increase the value of your home.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Refinance when going to sell?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Im not familiar with the system in France, but in the US, even if you are paying cash all the time, there are some benefits to getting a credit card and paying it off in full every month, instead of simply paying with cash. Some of those benefits are One pretty big downside of having a credit card depends on your personality. Some people, once they have credit, end up spending beyond their means, and end up getting into debt. Please look into whether credit cards work the same way in France before considering the above advice. As for your question regarding getting a loan vs paying cash, that will usually be personal preference, since with a loan you can buy expensive items such as a house or car much sooner than you otherwise could if you waited until you saved the money. For example, it might take 10 years or more to build up enough money to purchase a house with cash, so if you dont want to wait that long, youll need to finance it.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: In which situations is it better to consider a loan instead of paying cash?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does a bank make money on an interest free secured loan?,"Very good answers as to how 0 loans are typically done. In addition, many are either tied to a specific large item purchase, or credit cards with a no interest period. On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee. In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale. They will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal, or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates, but you dont get both.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does a bank make money on an interest free secured loan?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Pay team mates out of revenues on my name,"Can I deduct the money that I giving to my team mates from the taxes that I pay? If yes, how should I record the transaction? Why? Why are you giving money to your team mates? Thats the most important question, and any answer without taking this into account is not full. You would probably have to talk to a professional tax adviser a CPAEA licensed in your state about the details, but in general  you cannot deduct money you give someone just because you feel like it. Moreover, it may be subject to an additional tax  the gift tax. PS We dont have any partnership or something similar, it is just each of us on his own. Assuming you want to give your team mates money because you developed the project together  then you do in fact have a partnership. In order to split the income properly, you should get a tax ID for the partnership, and issue a 1065 and K1 for each team mate. In most states, you dont need to ""register"" a partnership with the state. Mere ""lets do things together"" creates a partnership. Otherwise, if they work for you as opposed to with you in the case above, you can treat it as your own business income, and pay your team mates who are now your contractorsemployees accordingly. Be careful here, because the difference between contractor and employee in tax law is significant, and you may end up being on the hook for a lot of things youre not aware of. Bottom line, in certain situation you cannot deduct, in others you can  you have to discuss it with a professional.

How does AMTstate taxes work for stock options in California?,"Does this technically mean that she has to pay AMT on 400,000? Yes. Well, not exactly 400,000. She paid 1 per share, so 390,000. And if so, is 28 the AMT for this sum? 0.28  400,000  112,000? Or does she have to include her salary on top of that before calculating AMT? Suppose in the fake example that her salary is 100,000 after 401k. All her income is included in calculating the AMT, minus the AMT exemption amount. The difference between the regular calculated tax and the calculated AMT is then added to the regular tax. Note that some deductions allowed for the regular calculation are not allowed for the AMT calculation. How does California state tax come into play for this? California has its own AMT rules, and in California any stock option exercise is subject to AMT, unless you sell the stock in the same year. Heres a nice and easy to understand write up on the issue from the FTB. When would she have to pay the taxes for this huge AMT? Tax is due when income is received i.e. when you exercise the options. However, most people dont actually pay the tax then, but rather discover the huge tax liability when they prepare to submit their tax return on April 15th. To avoid that, Id suggest trying to estimate the tax and adjust your withholding using form W4 so that by the end of the year you have enough withheld. Suppose in the worst case, the company goes completely under. Does she get her massive amounts of tax back? Or if its tax credit, where can I find more info on this? That would be capital loss, and only up to 3K a year of capital loss can be deducted from the general income. So it will continue offsetting other capital gains or being deducted 3K a year until it all clears out. Is there any way to avoid this tax? Can she file an 83b election? You asked and answered. Yes, filing 83b election is the way to go to avoid this situation. This should be done within 30 days of the grant, and submitted to the IRS, and a copy attached to the tax return of the grant year. However, if youre considering exercise  that ship has likely sailed a long time ago. Any advice for Little Susie on how she can even afford to pay that much tax on something she cant even sell anytime soon? Dont exercise the options? Should she take out a loan? e.g. Ive heard that in the extreme case, you can find angel investors who are willing to pay all your taxesstrike price, but want 50 of your equity? Ive also heard that you can sell your illiquid shares on SecondMarket? Is she likely to get audited by IRS for pulling something like this? You can take a loan secured by shares you own, theres nothing illegal in it. If you transfer your shares  the IRS only cares about the taxes being paid, however that may be illegal depending on the terms and the conditions of the grant. Youll need to talk to a lawyer about your situation.

"What is the fastest way to retire, using passive income on real estate ","You cant calculate how many houses it will take. To do so you would have to know how much you can charge in rent compared to how much is costs to run that particular location. If the desirability of that location changes, so does the ability to rent the place, and so does the amount you can charge. It is possible to create a business in real estate that would allow you to generate retirement income. But you would be focusing all your income in your retirement years on one segment of the entire investment universe. The diversification would have to come from spreading the money through different types of real estate condo, apartments, houses, commercial, warehouse, light industrial. You would even have to decide whether you want them all in one micromarket, or spread throughout a larger market, or an even wider area diversification.

How to rescue my money from negative interest?,"First off, the answer to your question is something EVERYONE would like to know. There are fund managers at Fidelity who will a pay 100 million fee to someone who can tell them a ""safe"" way to earn interest. The first thing to decide, is do you want to save money, or invest money. If you just want to save your money, you can keep it in cash, certificates of deposit or gold. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, gold tends to hold its value over time and will always have value. Even if Russia invades Switzerland and the Swiss Franc becomes worthless, your gold will still be useful and spendable. As Alan Greenspan famously wrote long ago, ""Gold is always accepted."" If you want to invest money and make it grow, yet still have the money ""fluent"" which I assume means liquid, your main option is a major equity, since those can be readily bought and sold. I know in your question you are reluctant to put your money at the ""mercy"" of one stock, but the criteria you have listed match up with an equity investment, so if you want to meet your goals, you are going to have to come to terms with your fears and buy a stock. Find a good blue chip stock that is in an industry with positive prospects. Stay away from stuff that is sexy or hyped. Focus on just one stockthat way you can research it to death. The better you understand what you are buying, the greater the chance of success. Zurich Financial Services is a very solid company right now in a nice, boring, highly profitable business. Might fit your needs perfectly. They were founded in 1872, one of the safest equities you will find. Nestle is another option. Roche is another. If you want something a little more risky consider Georg Fischer. Anyway, what I can tell you, is that your goals match up with a blue chip equity as the logical type of investment. Note on Diversification Many financial advisors will advise you to ""diversify"", for example, by investing in many stocks instead of just one, or even by buying funds that are invested in hundreds of stocks, or indexes that are invested in the whole market. I disagree with this philosophy. Would you go into a casino and divide your money, putting a small portion on each game? No, it is a bad idea because most of the games have poor returns. Yet, that is exactly what you do when you diversify. It is a false sense of safety. The proper thing to do is exactly what you would do if forced to bet in casino find the game with the best return, get as good as you can at that game, and play just that one game.

So in terms of when to renegotiate, I think approaching the issue after the dust has settled is more realistic.

Inflation actually causes people not to spend could it be true? ,"We need to be careful what we are talking about here. Inflation on a economylevel scale at an expected rate will not change consumer habits because the price increase is manageable. You have to realize that prices are not increasing in isolation wages will have to rise along too. High inflation that is expected will increase consumption of durable goods, as people attempt to get rid of their money before the price changes on them. A good example of this was postWWI germany, where hyperinflation was so bad that offices began to pay their employees twice daily, so they could adjust their wages, and so that their employees could go out during lunch and after work to buy something with the money before the price changed on them. Unexpected inflation may cause a temporary dip in spending until wages adjust, however consumers still need to buy, so they will likely push for higher wages, leading to consumption to stay about level. There is another effect to inflation as well People who have savings will have their savings eroded over time if the economy is inflationary. To preserve their wealth, they will invest it. In a deflationary environment, money will increase in value simply by being hoarded, so they will be less willing to invest it. Deflation also increases the cost of interest on a loan, while inflation decreases it. So the overall effect is for an increase in spending under inflation, and a decrease under deflation. The person you have quoted is quite wrong. Price increases in a particular sector will cause consumer spending to decrease but this is a bad example, as it is not inflation, but rather a supplydemand problem of a particular consumer good. They are applying a microeconomic model price increases of a single good to a macroeconomic problem price increases in the entire economy when price increases at a global scale have the opposite effects. A good theoretical test of this is what would happen if everyone in the US suddenly had twice as much money? Ignoring international trade, of course. The answer prices will double, and nothing else will change. The reason is, people will have more money to spend, but will require more money for their services, so in the end it all cancels out.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Inflation actually causes people not to spend could it be true?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Are solar cell panels and wind mills worth the money?,"Although this isnt related to homes directly, as an IT professional I know that wind power tends to be cost effective to the point that many data centers the massive buildings holding the servers that are the backbone of the internet actually invest in their own wind turbines to slash costs since servers tend to be power hogs. As far as going ""off the grid"" that ultimately depends on how much windsun youre getting at your residence, but if you look at places like Dallas, PA, CA, and other areas where the major hosts place centers, theyre typically in areas where theres plenty of sunlight or wind. Going back to small scale thinking however, one of my contacts actually leases a colocation building in PA where he has a few server racks, and while he currently has electric there, he also owns a couple of turbines which have been powering 60 of the demand, and hes actually planning to add solar and also feed that back to the grid at a profit. So overall windsolar definitely has the potential for a decent ROI, at both large and small levels, but performance will vary greatly from area to area.

How to calculate how far a shorted stocks price can rise before broker issues a margin call?,"Most brokers have a margin maintenance requirement of 30. In your example, it would depend on how much money youre borrowing from your broker on margin. Consider this You have 250, and short AAPL at 500 on margin.

If your broker had a requirement of 30, they would require that for your 500 position, you have at least 500  .3  150 equity. Since you are currently above that number at 250, you will not be hit with a margin call. Say the price of AAPL doubles, and now your position is worth 1000. 1000  .3  300, which is 50 above your initial equity. Your broker will now consider you eligible for a margin call. Most will not execute the call right away, you will often have some time to either sellcover stock or add funds to your account. But not all brokers will warn you if you are breaking margin requirements, and sometimes margin calls can take you by surprise if you are not paying attention.

"Should I consolidate loans and cards, or just cards, leaving multiple loans?","First of all, congratulations on admitting your problem and on your determination to be debtfree. Recognizing your mistakes is a huge first step, and getting rid of your debt is a very worthwhile goal. When considering debt consolidation, there are really only two reasons to do so Reason 1 To lower your monthly payment. If you are having trouble coming up with enough money to meet your monthly obligations, debt consolidation can lower your monthly payment by extending the time frame of the debt. The problem with this one is that it doesnt help you get out of debt faster. It actually makes it longer before you are out of debt and will increase the total amount of interest that you will pay to the banks before you are done. So I would not recommend debt consolidation for this reason unless you are truly struggling with your cashflow because your minimum monthly payments are too high. In your situation, it does not sound like you need to consolidate for this reason. Reason 2 To lower your interest rate. If your debt is at a very high rate, debt consolidation can lower your interest rate, which can reduce the time it will take to eliminate your debt. The consolidation loan you are considering is at a high interest rate on its own 13.89. Now, it is true that some of your debt is higher than that, but it looks like the majority of your debt is less than that rate. It doesnt sound to me that you will save a significant amount of money by consolidating in this loan. If you can obtain a better consolidation loan in the future, it might be worth considering. From your question, it looks like your reasoning for the consolidation loan is to close the credit card accounts as quickly as possible. I agree that you need to quit using the cards, but this can also be accomplished by destroying the cards. The consolidation loan is not needed for this. You also mentioned that you are considering adding 3,000 to your debt. I have to say that it doesnt make sense at all to me to add to your debt especially at 13.89 when your goal is to eliminate your debt. To answer your question explicitly, yes, the ""cash buffer"" from the loan is a very bad idea. Here is what I recommend This is based on this answer, but customized for you. Cut updestroy your credit cards. Today. Youve already recognized that they are a problem for you. Cash, checks, and debit cards are what you need to use from now on. Start working from a monthly budget, assigning a job for every dollar that you have. This will allow you to decide what to spend your money on, rather than arriving at the end of the month with no idea where your money was lost. Budgeting software can make this task easier. See this question for more information. Your first goal should be to put a small amount of money in a savings account, perhaps 1000  1500 total. This is the start of your emergency fund. This money will ensure that if something unexpected and urgent comes up, you wont be so cash poor that you need to borrow money again. Note this money should only be touched in an actual emergency, and if spent, should be replenished as soon as possible. At the rate you are talking about, it should take you less than a month to do this. After youve got your small emergency fund in place, attack the debt as quickly and aggressively as possible. The order that you pay off your debts is not significant. The optimal method is up for debate. At the rate you suggested 2,000  2,500 per month, you can be completely debt free in maybe 18 months. As you pay off those credit cards, completely close the accounts. Ignore the conventional wisdom that tells you to leave the unused credit card accounts open to try to preserve a few points on your credit score. Just close them. After you are completely debt free, take the money that you were throwing at your debt, and use it to build up your emergency fund until it is 36 months worth of your expenses. That way, youll be able to handle a small crisis without borrowing anything. If you need more helpmotivation on becoming debt free and budgeting, I recommend the book The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Should I consolidate loans and cards, or just cards, leaving multiple loans?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

The direct analog to the SP 500 would be the U.S. Corporate Investment Grade index, which is tracked by the ETF LQD, and contains exactly what it sounds like. Citigroup formerly Salomon Brothers also has a competitor index to the Aggregate known as Broad Investment Grade BIG, and Merrill Lynch now Bank of America has the Domestic Master.

Calculating required rate of return for an incomegenerating savings account,"Line one shows your 1M, a return with a given rate, and year end withdrawal starting at 25,000. So Line 2 starts with that balance, applies the rate again, and shows the higher withdrawal, by 3yr. In Column one, I show the cumulative effect of the 3 inflation, and the last number in this column is the final balance 903K but divided by the cumulative inflation. To summarize  if you simply get the return of inflation, and start by spending just that amount, youll find that after 20 years, you have half your real value. The 1.029 is a trial and error method, as I dont know how a finance calculator would handle such a payment flow. I can load the sheet somewhere if youd like.

What is a mutual fund?,"Lets say that you want to invest in the stock market. Choosing and investing in only one stock is risky. You can lower your risk by diversifying, or investing in lots of different stocks. However, you have some problems with this When you buy stocks directly, you have to buy whole shares, and you dont have enough money to buy even one whole share of all the stocks you want to invest in. You arent even sure which stocks you should buy. A mutual fund solves both of these problems. You get together with other investors and pool your money together to buy a group of stocks. That way, your investment is diversified in lots of different stocks without having to have enough money to buy whole shares of each one. And the mutual fund has a manager that chooses which stocks the fund will invest in, so you dont have to pick. There are lots of mutual funds to choose from, with as many different objectives as you can imagine. Some invest in large companies, others small some invest in a certain sector of companies utilities or health care, for example, some invest in stocks that pay a dividend, others are focused on growth. Some funds dont invest in stocks at all they might invest in bonds, real estate, or precious metals. Some funds are actively managed, where the manager actively buys and sells different stocks in the fund continuously and takes a fee for his services, and others simply invest in a list of stocks and rarely buy or sell these are called index funds. To answer your question, yes, the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity Fund is a mutual fund.

"What happens if one brings more than 10,000 USD with them into the US?","Since all the other answers thus far seem to downplay the risk likelihood of the money being seized, I figure I may as well make my comment an answer. Unless you happen to have your legal team travelling with you and your suitcase of cash, you should expect that youll be questioned extensively, so that any sign of nervousness, inconsistency in your answers or anything you say that doesnt ""make sense"" to the officer will be used as an excuse to seize your money, and youll learn an expensive lesson in civil asset forfeiture. The government will file a complaint against your money, leading to a ridiculously named case, such as United States v. 124,700 in U.S. Currency. Worth noting that while the outcome in this case was not in the governments favor, in the vast majority of cases, the government keeps the cash. Between 911 and 2014, U.S police forces have seized over 2.5 billion dollars in cash without search warrants or indictments and returned the money in less than 10 of cases.

Business Expense  Car Insurance Deductible For Accident That Occurred During a Business Trip,"As a general rule, you must choose between a mileage deduction or an actual expenses deduction. The idea is that the mileage deduction is supposed to cover all costs of using the car. Exceptions include parking fees and tolls, which can be deducted separately under either method. You explicitly cannot deduct insurance costs if you claim a mileage deduction. Separately, you probably wont be able to deduct the deductible for your car as a casualty loss. You first subtract 100 from the deductible and then divide it by your Adjusted Gross Income AGI from your tax return. If your deductible is over 10 of your AGI, you can deduct it. Note that even with a 1500 deductible, you wont be able to deduct anything if you made more than 14,000 for the year.

Malaysian real estate How to know if the market is overheated or in a bubble?,"The Motley Fool suggested a good rule of thumb in one of their articles that may be able to help you determine if the market is overheating. Determine the entire cost of rent for a piece of property. So if rent is 300month, total cost over a year is 3600. Compare that to the cost of buying a similar piece of property by dividing the property price by the rent per year. So if a similar property is 90,000, the ratio would be 90,0003600  25. If the ratio is  20, theres a good chance that the market is overheated. This method is clearly not foolproof, but it helps quantify the irrationality of some individuals who think that buying a place is always better than renting.

Will an ETF increase in price if an underlying stock increases in price,"The creation mechanism for ETFs ensures that the value of the underlying stocks do not diverge significantly from the Funds value. Authorized participants have a strong incentive to arbitrage any pricing differences and createredeem blocks of stocketf until the prices are back inline. Contrary to what was stated in a previous answer, this mechanism lowers the cost of management of ETFs when compared to mutual funds that must access the market on a regular basis when any investors enterexit the fund. The ETF only needs to createredeem in a wholesale basis, this allows them to operate with management fees that are much lower than those of a mutual fund. Expenses Due to the passive nature of indexed strategies, the internal expenses of most ETFs are considerably lower than those of many mutual funds. Of the more than 900 available ETFs listed on Morningstar in 2010, those with the lowest expense ratios charged about .10, while those with the highest expenses ran about 1.25. By comparison, the lowest fund fees range from .01 to more than 10 per year for other funds.

If you insist on a riskfree and highly liquid investment, you will get the riskfree and highly liquid rate, which is currently around 1.

Proscons of borrowing money using a mortgage loan and investing it in a lowfee index fund?,"Something very similar to this was extremely popular in the UK in the late 1980s. The practice has completely vanished since the early 2000s. Reading up on the UK endowment mortgage scandals will probably give you an excellent insight into whether you should attempt your plan. Endowment mortgages were provided by banks and at their peak were probably the most popular mortgage form. The basic idea was that you only pay the interest on your mortgage and invest a small amount each month into a low fee endowment policy. Many endowment policies were simply index tracking, and the idea being that by the end of your mortgage you would have built up a portfolio sufficient to pay off your mortgage, and may well have extra left over. In the late 1990s the combination of falling housing market and poor stock performance meant that many people were left with both the endowment less than their mortgage and their house in negative equity.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Proscons of borrowing money using a mortgage loan and investing it in a lowfee index fund?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why small retail stores ask for ID with a credit card while big dont,"Because large stores do not pay their cashiers enough that the companies can dock the employees pay if they allow a bad credit card to go through. So most cashiers at large stores wont take the extra effort to check the card properly. As a result, large stores come up with other ways to handle potential credit card fraud. For example, they calculate a certain amount of fraud as expected and include it in their price calculations. Or they can use cameras to catch fraudsters. At small stores, there is a much higher chance that the cashier is either the owner or a relative of the owner. And even those who are unrelated tend to be hired by the owner directly. The owners do have their pay docked if a bad credit card is accepted, as their pay is the profit from the business. So they tend to create protocols that, at least in their mind, reduce the chance of taking a bad credit card. The cashier is often the only employee in the store to check anything. Another issue is that small stores have a harder time getting approved to accept credit cards. The companies that process the credit cards can take back their machine if there is a lot of fraud. So the companies can require more from small stores than they can from big stores. Those companies cant stop processing cards for Safeway, because they need Safeway as much if not more than Safeway needs them. So the processors have more leverage to make small stores do what they want. And small stores can feasibly fire nonowner cashiers who do not comply. Owners of course cant be fired. But they are far more vulnerable to business losses. So it is really important to an owner to keep the credit card machine. And it is pretty important to avoid losses, as it is their money directly. Relatives of owners may be safe from firing, but they are not safe from family retaliation like taking away television privileges. And they may also think of the effect of business losses on the family. Large stores can fire cashiers, but they are chronically understaffed and almost none of their cashiers will consistently follow a strict protocol. Since fraudsters only need to succeed once, an inconsistent application is almost as bad as no application. They might charge the cashiers for fraud, but then they would have to pay the cashiers more than minimum wage specifically for that reason e.g. a 50 a month bonus for no fraud. For many of them, its cheaper to risk the fraud. And large stores cant mix owners and relatives of owners into the mix. Its hard to say who owns Safeway. And even if you could, the relationship between one fraud transaction and the dividend paid on one share of stock is tiny. It would take thousands of shares to get up to a penny.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why small retail stores ask for ID with a credit card while big dont?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Once stock prices are down, where to look for good stock market deals? ","Something you might want to consider, instead of going out bargain hunting in hopes of picking something up on the cheap is to start doing you research now for a stock you would like to have in your portfolio and watch it for news that might cause it to go down before picking it up when it is down for a bit.

Why charge gross receipts taxes to the customer?,"Ill address one part of your question There are other taxes that companies pay as well, such as income tax, but dont charge to the customer as a fee. So, why are gross receipts taxes charged to the customer? Things like income tax cant be passed on to the consumer in a direct way, because theres no fixed relationship between the amount of the tax and the price of an individual product. Income tax is paid on taxable income, which will incorporate deductions for the costs the company incurred to do business. So the final amount of corporate income tax can depend on things unrelated to the price of goods sold, like whether the business decided to repave their parking lot. Gross receipts taxes, by definition, are charged on the total amount of money taken in, so every dollar you spend on an item at the store will be subject to the gross receipts tax, and hence will cost the business 7 cents or X where X is the tax rate. This means there is a direct link between the price you pay for an individual item and the tax they pay on that transaction. The same is true for sales taxes, which are also often added at the time of sale. Of course, businesses could roll all of these into the posted price as well. The reason they dont is to get their foot in the door and make the price seem lower youre more likely to buy something if you see it for the low, low, onetimeonly price of 99.99, act now, save big, and then find out you owe an extra 7 at the register than if you saw 107 on the price tag.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why charge gross receipts taxes to the customer?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Cash flow implications of converting primary mortgaged residence to rental,"You have some of the math right, but are missing a few things. Heres what I can offer  if I leave anything out, someone please expand or clarify. Rental income can be reduced by mortgage interest and maintenance costs as you mentioned, but also by property tax payments, association fees, insurance costs, landlord expenses, and depreciation. Note that if you dont live in the property for 3 years, youll have to pay capital gains tax ifwhen you sell the house. You can live in it again for 2 of the last 5 years to avoid this. Many people recommend only assuming you will get 10 months of rental income a year, to account for transitions between tenants, difficult in finding new tenants, and the occasional deadbeat tenant. This also adds a buffer for unexpected problems you need to fix in the house. If you cant at least break even on 10 months of income a year, consider the risk. I think there are also some cases where you need to repay depreciation amounts that you have deducted, but I dont know the details.

Are ExchangeTraded Funds ETFs less safe than regular mutual funds?,"I wonder if ETFs are further removed from the actual underlying holdings or assets giving value to the fund, as compared to regular mutual funds. Not exactly removed. But slightly different. Whenever a Fund want to launch an ETF, it would buy the underlying shares create units. Lets say it purchased 10 of A, 20 of B and 25 of C. And created 100 units for price x. As part of listing, the ETF company will keep the purchased shares of A,B,C with a custodian. Only then it is allowed to sell the 100 units into the market. Once created, units are bought or sold like regular stock. In case the demand is huge, more units are created and the underlying shares kept with custodian. So, for instance, would VTI and Total Stock Market Index Admiral Shares be equally anchored to the underlying shares of the companies within the index? Yes they are. Are they both connected? Yes to an extent. The way Vanguard is managing this is given a Index [Investment Objective] it is further splitting the common set of assets into different class. Read more at Share Class.

Book capital losses in gnucash,"It depends on whether or not you are referring to realized or unrealized gains.

How can I improve my credit score if I am not paying bills or rent?,"For those who are looking to improve credit for the sake of being able to obtain future credit on better terms, I think a rewards credit card is the best way to do that. I recommend that you only use as many cards as you need to gain the best rewards. I have one card that gives 6 back on grocery purchases, and I have another card that gives 4 back on [petrol] and 2 back on dining out. Both of those cards give only 1 back on all other purchases, so I use a third card that gives 1.5 back across the board for my other purchases. I pay all of the cards in full each month. If there was a card that didnt give me an advantage in making my purchases, I wouldnt own it. Im generally frugal, so I know that there is no psychological disadvantage to paying with a card. You have to consider your own spending discipline when deciding whether paying with cards is an advantage for you. In the end, you should only use debt when you can pay low interest rates or as in the case of the cards above, no interest at all. In the case of the low interest debt, it should be allowing you to make an investment that will pay you more by having it sooner than the cost of interest. You might need a car to get to work, but you probably dont need a new car. Borrow as little as you can and repay your loans as quickly as you can. Debt can be a tool for your advantage, but only if used wisely.

"I have more than 250,000 in a US Bank account mistake?","First, whats the reason? Why do you have that much in cash at all  are you concerned about market volatility, are you planning to buy a house, do you have tens of millions of dollars and this is your slush fund? Are you a house flipper and this is part of business for you? If you need the money for short term use  ie, youre buying a house in cash next month  then as long as youre in a sound bank one of the big national ones, for example it seems reasonable. You can never predict a crash like 2008, but it seems unlikely that Chase or Citibank will go under in the next few weeks. If you like to have a cash position, then split the money among multiple banks. Buy a CD at one major bank with some of the amount. My inlaws have a trust which is partially invested in CDs, and they use multiple banks for this purpose to keep their accounts fully insured. Each separate bank youre covered up to 250k, so if you have 150k at Chase and 150k at a local bank, youre covered. Youre also covered in a much larger amount  up to 1MM potentially  if you are married, as you can have a separate account each for 250k and a joint account up to 500k. Otherwise, why do you have that much in cash? You should invest it in something that will return more than inflation, at a minimum... Edit postclarifications 350k is around my level of Maybe, maybe not. Youre risking 100k on a pretty low risk assuming this isnt a small local bank, and even those are pretty low still. In order to remove that risk you have to do something active  ie, take 100k somewhere else, open a new bank account, etc.  which isnt exactly the hardest thing in the world, but it does take effort. Is it worth the 0.001 chance entirely made up you lose the 100k? Thats 10, if you agree with that risk chance. Up to you. It wouldnt be particularly hard, though, to open an account with an online bank, deposit 100k in there in a 6 month CD, then pay the IRS from your other account and when the 6 month CD expires take the cash back into your active account. Assuming youre not planning on buying a house in the next six months this should be fine, Id think and even then youd still have 150k for the downpayment up front, which is enough to buy a 750k house wo PMI. Additionally, as several commenters note if you can reasonably do so, and your money wont be making significant interest, you might choose to pay your taxes now rather than later. This removes the risk entirely the likely small interest you earn over 3 months may be similar to the amount youd spend mostly of your time, plus possibly actual expenses moving it to another bank. If youre making 2 or 3 this may not be true, but if youre in a 0.25 account like my accounts are, 100k  0.25  0.25 is 62.50, after all.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: I have more than 250,000 in a US Bank account mistake?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Investment property refinance following a low appraisal?,"The new payment on 172,500 3.5 15yr would be 1233mo compared to 1614mo now 26 biweekly payments, but 12 months. Assuming the difference is nearly all interest, the savings is closer to 285mo than 381. Note, actual savings are different, the actual savings is based on the difference in interest over the year. Since the term will be changing, Im looking at cash flow, which is the larger concern, in my opinion. 17,000285 is 60 months. This is your break even time to payoff the 17000, higher actually since the 17K will be accruing interest. I didnt see any mention of closing costs or other expenses. Obviously, that has to be factored in as well. I think the trade off isnt worth it. As the other answers suggest, the rental is too close to breakeven now. The cost of repairs on two houses is an issue. In my opinion, its less about the expenses being huge than being random. You dont get billed 35mo to paint the house. You wake up, see too many spots showing wear, and get a 3000 bill. Same for all high cost items, Roof, HVAC, etc. You are permitted to borrow 50 of your 401k balance, so you have 64K in the account. I dont know your age, this might be great or a bit low. Id keep saving, not putting any extra toward either mortgage until I had an emergency fund that was more than sufficient. The fund needs to handle the unexpected expenses as well as the months of unemployment. In general, 69 months of these expenses is recommended. To be clear, there are times a 401k loan can make sense. I just dont see that it does now. Disclaimer  when analyzing refis there are two approaches. The first is to look at interest saved. After all, interest is the expense, principal payments go right to your balance sheet. The second is purely cash flow, in which case one might justify a higher rate, and going from 15 to 30 years, but freeing up cash that can be better deployed. Even though the rate goes up say 12, the payment drops due to the term. Take that savings and deposit to a matched 401k and the numbers may work out very well.

No trading data other than close for a stock on a given date,"There are several reasons why this may happen and I will update as I get more information from you. Volumes on that stock look low supposing that they are either in a factor between 1s and 1000s so it could well be that there was no volume on that day. If no trades occur then open, high and low are meaningless as they are statistics based on trades that occur that day and no trades occur. Remember that there has to be volume to get a price. The stock may have been frozen by either the exchange or the company for the day. This could be for various reasons including to prevent some illegal activity. In that case no trades were made because the market for that stock was closed. Another possibility is that all trades that day were cancelled by the exchange. The exchange may cancel all trades if there is unusual, potentially fraudulent or other illegal activity on the stock. In this case the last price for that day existed but was rolled back by the exchange and never occurred. This is a rare situation. Although I cant find any holidays on that date it is possible that this is how your data provider marks market holidays. It would be valid to ignore the data in that case as being from a nonmarket day. I cannot tell if this is possible without knowing exchange information. There is a possibility that some data providers dont receive data for a day or that it gets corrupted. It may be worth checking another source to ensure the integrity of the data that you are receiving. Whichever reason is true, the data provider has made the close equal to the previous days close as no price movements occurred. Strictly the closing price is the price of the last trade made for that day and so should be null and open, high and low should be null too and not 0 otherwise the price change on day is very large!.

Can an unmarried couple buy a home together with only one person on the mortgage?,"It is highly unlikely that this would be approved by a mortgage underwriter. When the bank gives a loan with a security interest in a property a lien, they are protected  if the borrower does not repay the loan, the property can be foreclosed on and sold, and the lender is made whole for the amount of the loan that was not repaid. When two parties are listed on the deed, then each owns an UNDIVIDED 50 share in the property. If only one party has pledged the property as surety against the loan, then in effect only 50 of the property is forecloseable. This means that the bank is unable to recoup its loss. For a fictional, highly simplified concrete example, suppose that the house is worth 100,000 and Adam and Zoe are listed on the deed, but Adam is the borrower for a 100,000 mortgage. Adam owes 100,000 and has an asset worth 50,000 which he has pledged as security for the loan, while Zoe owes nothing and has an asset worth 50,000 which is entirely unencumbered. If Adam does not pay the mortgage, the bank would only be able to foreclose on his 50,000 half of the property, leaving them exposed to great risk. There are other legal and financial reasons, but overall I think youll find it very difficult to locate a lender who is willing to take that kind of risk. Its very complicated and there is absolutely no upside.

When will the U.K. convert to the Euro as an official currency?,"When economies are strong, it is particularly alluring to have a single currency as it makes trade and tourism simpler and helps reduce costs. The problem comes when individual member economies get into trouble. Because the Eurozone is a loose grouping of nations, there is no direct equivalent of the US Federal government to coordinate a response, there is instead an odd mixture of National and Central government that makes it harder to get a unified approach to the economy OK, its maybe not so different to the US in reality. This lack of flexibility means that some of the key levers of international finance are compromised, for example a weak economy cant float its currency to improve exports. Similarly individual countrys interest rates cant be adjusted to balance spending. I suspect the main reason though is political and based on concepts of sovereignty and national pride. The UK does the majority of its trade with the Eurozone, so the pros would possibly outweigh the cons, but the UK as a whole and some of our papers in particular have always regarded Europe with suspicion. Most Brits only speak English and find France and Germany a strange and obtuse place. The almost common language makes it easier to relate to the US and Canada than our near neighbours. It seems the perception amongst the political establishment is that any attempt to join the Euro is political suicide, while that is the case it is unlikely to happen. Purely from a personal perspective, Id welcome the Euro except it means a lot of the products I routinely buy would become a lot more expensive if price is harmonised. For an example compare the price of the iPod Touch in the UK 209.99 to France299. The French pay 262 at the current exchange rate, which is close to 25 more. Ouch.

How can I profit on the Chinese RealEstate Bubble?,"Perhaps buying some internationally exchanged stock of China realestate companies? Its never too late to enter a bubble or profit from a bubble after it bursts. As a native Chinese, my observations suggest that the bubble may exist in a few of the most populated cities of China such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the price doesnt seem to be much higher than expected in cities further within the mainland, such as Xian and Chengdu. I myself is living in Xian. I did a post about the urban housing cost of Xian at the end of last year httpwww.xianhotels.infourbanhousingcostofxianchina15 It may give you a rough idea of the pricing level. The average of 5,500 CNY per square meter condo hasnt fluctuated much since the posting of the entry. But you need to pay about 1,000 to 3,000 higher to get something desirable. For location, just search ""Xian, China"" in Google Maps.  I actually have no idea how you, a foreigner can safely and easily profit from this. Ill just share what I know. Its really hard to financially enter China. To prevent oversea speculative funds from freely entering and leaving China, the Admin of Forex safe.gov.cn has laid down a range of rigid policies regarding currency exchange. By law, any native individual, such as me, is imposed of a maximum of 50,000 that can be converted from USD to CNY or the other way around per year AND a maximum of 10,000 per day. Larger chunks of exchange must get the written consent of the Admin of Forex or it will simply not be cleared by any of the banks in China, even HSBC thats not owned by China. However, you can circumvent this limit by using the social ID of your immediate relatives when submitting exchange requests. It takes extra time and effort but viable. However, things may change drastically should China be in a forex crisis or simply war. You may not be able to withdraw USD at all from the banks in China, even with a positive balance thats your own money. My whole income stream are USD which is wired monthly from US to Bank of China. I purchased a property in the middle of last year thats worth 275,000 CNY using the funds I exchanged from USD I had earned. Its a 43.7 down payment on a mortgage loan of 20 years httpwww.mlcalc.commortgage27500043.7204.284000.5272009year in CNY, not USD The current household loan rate is 6.12 across the entire China. However, because this is my first property, it is discounted by 30 to 4.284 to encourage the first house purchase.

How does a nolimit charge card affect your credit score?,"Apparently it is up to the credit card company on how they want to report your available balance. Another disadvantage to the nolimit credit card may not be apparent to most people, but it is something noted by organizations like The Motley Fool, which is expert in many issues of finance and investment. Part of your credit score, about 30, considers the amount of money you have borrowed, and the limit on your present credit cards. A nolimit credit card company may report your limit as 0 if you have not used the card, or they may report a maximum limit available to you. They may not, nor are they obligated, to report times when you put tons of expenses on a credit card and then paid them off. While some companies will report your timely payments and paid off amounts, others simply report an extremely low limit. For instance if you spent 100 US Dollars USD, your limit might be considered 100 USD, or it may merely be reported as zero. Youll need to check with a credit card company on how they report payments and limits on a nolimit credit card before you obtain one. Some people who are scrupulous are paying off their cards at the end of each month suffer major losses to their credit score, without even realizing it, if their spending ability is rated at zero, or their payments dont count toward showing credit worthiness.

How can I get the car refinanced under my name if my girlfriend signed for the loan?,Your best bet would be to add your name to the title through the bank or have her sell it to you for the amount she owes then you get a loan for that amount like they said before. If you guys split up at this point shell legally get to keep the car youve been paying for. You could apply for a new loan and have her cosign but itll make your monthly payments higher. Have her sell you the car for the amount owed them you get a loan for that amount. Since you are together and youve been paying for it you wont lose any money and your monthly payments wont be expensive if you dont owe that much on the car.

Are variable rate loans ever a good idea?,"The simple answer is absolutely. With the parameters you quote, if you will pay off the loan in 82 months or less, you will be ahead taking the variable rate. You have put your finger on the important question as well. The higher initial interest is buying insurance against rates rising if you dont pay off the loan within 82 months. I suspect the contract loan term is much longer than that, because otherwise a variable rate does not make sense. You need to assess whether the insurance you are buying is worth the premium. You can look at what the formula for the variable rate would set the rate at today. It is probably somewhat higher than the 3.79. That will tell you how much rates have to rise to make the variable rate go above 5.02. Note that if the loan term is around 160 months and it could well be 180 months, 15 years you can afford the interest to rise to about 6.2 for the last half and you will still be dollars ahead. It could even rise higher if you discount expenses in the future.

Why are auto leases stubbornly strict about visa status and how to work around that?,"When getting a car always start with your bank or credit union. They are very likely to offer better loan rate than the dealer. Because you start there you have a data point so you can tell if the dealer is giving you a good rate. Having the loan approved before going to the dealer allows you to negotiate the best deal for the purchase price for the car. When you are negotiating price, length of loan, down payment, and trade in it can get very confusing to determine if the deal is a good one. Sometimes you can also get a bigger rebate or discount because to the dealer you are paying cash. The general advice is that a lease for the average consumer is a bad deal. You are paying for the most expensive months, and at the end of the lease you dont have a car. With a loan you keep the car after you are done paying for it. Another reason to avoid the lease. It allows you to purchase a car that is two or three years old. These are the ones that just came off lease. I am not a car dealer, and I have never needed a work visa, but I think their concern is that there is a greater risk of you not being in the country for the entire period of the lease.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why are auto leases stubbornly strict about visa status and how to work around that?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why can it be a bad idea to buy stocks after hours?,"There are several reasons it is not recommended to trade stocks pre or postmarket, meaning outside of RTH regular trading hours. Since your question is not very detailed I have to assume you trade with a time horizon of at least more than a day, meaning you do not trade intraday. If this is true, all of the above points are a nonissue for you and a different set of points becomes important. As a general rule, using 3 is the safest regardless of what and how you trade because you get price guarantee in trade for execution guarantee. In the case of mid to longer term trading 1 week any of those points is viable, depending on how you want to do things, what your style is and what is the most comfortable for you. A few remarks though 2 are market orders, so if the open is quite the ride and you are in the back of the execution queue, you can get significant slippage. 1 may require live data of the postmarket session, which is often not easy to come by for the entire US stock universe. Depending on your physical execution method phone, fax, online, you may lack accurate information of the postmarket. If you want to execute orders based on RTH and only want to do that after hours because of personal schedule constraints, this is not really important. Personally I would always recommend 3, independent of the use case because it allows you more control over your orders and their fills. TLDR If you are trading longterm it does not really matter.

"If I plan to buy a car in cash, should I let the dealer know?","Ideally you would negotiate a car price without ever mentioning And other factors that affect the price. You and the dealer would then negotiate a true price for the car, followed by the application of rebates, followed by negotiating for the loan if there is to be one. In practice this rarely happens. The sales rep asks point blank what rebates you qualify for by asking gettoknowyou questions like where you work or if you served in the armed forces  you may not realize that these are doyouqualifyforarebate questions before youve even chosen a model. They take that into account right from the beginning, along with whether theyll make a profit lending you money, or have to spend something to subsidize your zero percent loan. However unlike your veterans status, your loan intentions are changeable. So when you get to the end you can ask if the price could be improved by paying cash. Or you could try putting the negotiated price on a credit card, and when they dont like that, ask for a further discount to stop you from using the credit card and paying cash.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If I plan to buy a car in cash, should I let the dealer know?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Let me explain the biases which make it so. US banking is reliable enough for the common citizen, that everyone simply uses banks. To elaborate, Americans who are unbanked either cant produce simple identity paperwork or they got an account but then got blacklisted for overdrawing it. These are problems of the poor, not millionaires. Outside of determined ""off the grid"" folks with political reasons to not be in the banking and credit systsm, anyone with money uses the banking system. Whos not a criminal, anyway. We also have strong laws against money laundering turning cash of questionable origin into ""sanitized"" cash on deposit in a bank. The most obvious trick is deposit 5000day for 200 days. Nope, thats Structuring yeah, we have a word for that. A guy with 1 million cash, it is presumed he has no choice he cant convert it into a bank deposit, as in this problem  note where she says she cant launder it. If its normal for people in your country to haul around cash, due to a defective banking system, youre not the only one with that problem, and nearby therell be a country with a good banking system who understands your situation. Deposit it there. Then retain a US lawyer who specializes in this, and follow his advice about moving the money to the US via funds transfer. Even then, you may have some explaining to do but far less than with cash. And keep in mind for those politically motivated offthefinancialgrid types, theyre a bit crazy but definitely not stupid, live a cash life everyday, and know the law better than anybody. They would definitely consider using banks and funds transfers for the border crossing proper, because of Customs.

How do I cash in physical stock certificates? GM 1989,"which means the current total is 548,100. Is that correct? Yep Unfortunately the ""current"" GM stock is different than the GM stock of 1989. GM went bankrupt in 2011. Its original stock changed to Motors Liquidation Company MTLQQ and is essentially worthless today. There was no conversion from the old stock to the new stock. What do I do with these certificates? Can I bring them to my bank, or do I need to open an account with a stock company like Fidelity? See here for some instructions on cashing them in or at least registering them electronically. Ive never dealt with physical stocks, but I presume that a broker is going to charge you something for registering them vs. direct registration, though I have no idea how much that would be. I read somewhere that I only have to pay taxes when I cash out these stocks. But are these rules any different because I inherited the stocks? You will pay capital gains tax on the increase in value from the time your father died to the time you sell the shares. If that time is more than one year and the stock has gone up in value you will pay a 15 tax on the total increase. If you have held them less than one year, they will be shortterm capital gains which will count as regular income, and you will pay whatever your marginal tax rate is. If you sell the stock at a loss, then youll be able to deduct some or all of that loss from your income, and may be able to carry forward losses for a few years as well. I did not catch that the stock you mention was GM stock. GM went bankrupt in 2011, so its likely that the stock you own is worthless. I have edited the first answer appropriately but left the other two since they apply more generally.

The bond is essentially a promise to pay back the money with interest, just like a loan. As you point out, the US can print money. If this were to happen, then the USD that the owner of a treasury bond receives when the bond matures are worth less that than the USD used to purchase the bonds. There are lots of reasons why the US doesnt want to print lots of money, so the purchaser of the bond is probably confident it wont happen. If for some reason they think it is possible, then they will want to cover that risk by only purchasing bonds that have a higher interest rate. The higher interest offsets the risk of the USD being worth less.

"Taxes Sold House this Year, Buying Next Year","When you sell your primary residence, you are required to capitalize any loss or gain at that point you do not carry over your loss or gain as you might in an investment property. As such, the timing of the purchase of the next house is not relevant in this discussion you gained however much you gained already. This changed from the other rollover method in 1997 see this bankrate article for more details. However, as discussed in IRS Tax Topic 701, you can exclude up to 250,000 single or filing separately or 500,000 married filing jointly of gain if it is your primary residence and meets a few requirements mostly, that you owned it for at least 2 years in the past 5 years, and similarly used it as your main home for at least 2 years of the past 5 years. So given you reported 25 gain, as long as your house is under a million dollars or so, youre fine and if its over a million dollars, you probably should be paying a CPA for this stuff. For California state tax, it looks like it is the same see this Turbotax forum answer for a good explanation and links to this California Franchise Tax Board guide which confirms it For sale or exchanges after May 6, 1997, federal law allows an exclusion of gain on the sale of a personal residence in the amount of 250,000 500,000 if married filing jointly. The taxpayer must have owned and occupied the residence as a principal residence for at least 2 of the 5 years before the sale. California conforms to this provision. However, California taxpayers who served in the Peace Corps during the 5 year period ending on the date of the sale may reduce the 2 year period by the period of service, not to exceed 18 months.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Taxes Sold House this Year, Buying Next Year?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Option trading High dollar value stock option and equity exposure,"Seems like you are concerned with something called assignment risk. Its an inherent risk of selling options you are giving somebody the right, but not the obligation, to sell to you 100 shares of GOOGL. Option buyers pay a premium to have that right  the extrinsic value. When they exercise the option, the option immediately disappears. Together with it, all the extrinsic value disappears. So, the lower the extrinsic value, the higher the assignment risk. Usually, option contracts that are very close to expiration lets say, around 2 to 3 weeks to expiration or less have significantly lower extrinsic value than longer option contracts. Also, generally speaking, the deeper ITM an option contract is, the lower extrinsic value it will have. So, to reduce assignment risk, I usually close out my option positions 12 weeks before expiration, especially the contracts that are deep in the money. edit to make sure this is clear, based on a comment Ive just seen on your question. To ""close out an options position"", you just have to create the ""opposite"" trade. So, if you sell a Put, you close that by buying back that exact same put. Just like stock if you buy stock, you have a position you close that position by selling the exact same stock, in the exact same amount. Thats a very common thing to do with options. A post in Tradekings forums, very old post, but with an interesting piece of data from the OCC, states that 35 of the options expire worthless, and 48 are bought or sold before expiration to close the position  only 17 of the contracts are actually exercised! httpcommunity.tradeking.commembersoptionsguyblogs11260whatpercentageofoptionsgetexercised A few other things to keep in mind certain stocks have ""mini options contracts"", that would correspond to a lot of 10 shares of stock. These contracts are usually not very liquid, though, so you might not get great prices when openingclosing positions you said in a comment, ""I cannot use this strategy to buy stocks like GOOGL"" if the reason is because 100GOOGL is too much to fit in your buying power, thats a pretty big risk  the assignment could result in a margin call! if margin call is not really your concern, but your concern is more like the risk of holding 100 shares of GOOGL, you can help manage that by buying some lower strike Puts that have smaller absolute delta than your Put, or selling some calls against your short put. Both strategies, while very different, will effectively reduce your delta exposure.

"How can I find a highrisk, highreward investment that is not strongly correlated with the U.S. economy?","High risk, high reward doesnt really mean anything. The reason that investments are risky is that the investor is clueless. As you gain more information and experience, you reduce the risk. To answer your question, you can consider BRIC ETFs Brazil, Russia, India and China. They are correlated to the U.S. economy. However, over the long term say, 40 years, they may make sense. It depends on your outlook. Do you think India and China will have bigger economies in than the U.S. in 40 years? Many people do. Do you think that countries that are rich in commodity resources like oil will do well in the next 5 years? If so, then those countries may do better than the U.S. Its not a clear answer to your question, but maybe it can help lead to a good solution for you.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can I find a highrisk, highreward investment that is not strongly correlated with the U.S. economy?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"How should we prioritize retirement savings, paying down debt, and saving for a house?","The advice to pay off near7 debt is tough to argue against. That said, Id project out a few years to understand the home purchase. Will you plan for the 20 down John recommends? The Crazy Truth about PMI cant be ignored. The way the math works, if you put 15 down, the PMI costs you so much, its nearly like paying 20 interest on that missing 5. If your answer is that you intend to save for the full downpayment, 20, and can still knock off the student loan, by all means, go for it. I have to question the validity of ""we will definitely be in a higher tax bracket when we retire."" By definition, pretax deposits save tax at the marginal rate. i.e. If you are in the 25 bracket, a 1000 deposit saves you 250 in tax that year. But, withdrawals come at your average rate, i.e. your tax bill divided by gross income. Theres the deductions for itemized deductions or the standard. Then 2 exemptions if you are married. Then the 10 bracket, etc. Today, a couple grossing 100K may be in the 25 bracket, but their average rate is 12. I read this QA again and would add one more observation  Student Loans and Your First Mortgage is an article I wrote in response to a friends similar question. With the OP having plan to buy a house, paying off the loan may be more costly in the long run. It may keep him from qualifying for the size mortgage he needs, or from having enough money to put 20 down, as I noted earlier.

Tax deductions on empty property,"A real estate business could offset income from occupied property with costs from vacant property held for speculation. For speculation, you can let a building rot, then get it reassessed. If the jurisdiction assesses part or all of the tax bill on the value of improvements, this can drop the annual tax bill significantly while you hold. If you plan to hold for a decade or more, this can be very important. Strategically, this also ruins the neighborhood property values, so you can assemble neighboring parcels to support future major developments. This is a long speculation game. Exemplars of the strategy include Richard Basciano who bought up several buildings in NYCs Times Square and installed adult theater tenants in the 70s, for payoff today and the late Sam Rappaport who pursued a strategy of squeezing rent and simply ignoring building inspection violations in Philadelphia, assembling major urban core parcels on the cheap, and whose children are now selling into strong markets. Legality Adult businesses are kind of a grey market covered by specific local ordinances, neither exactly illegal or perfectly legal. Ignoring building violations is not legal, but the penalties are fines, not jail. Its certainly not a ""nice"" strategy.

Why do some companies offer 401k retirement plans?,One important thing that hasnt been mentioned here is that the vast majority of companies have eventually eliminated their Company provided Pension Plans and replaced it with a 401K with some degree of matching.

Do my 401kRoth accounts benefit from compounding?,"During the course of the year, the SP individual stocks will have some dividends. Not every last stock but a good number of them. Enough that the average dividend for the SP has been about 2 recently. So if the SP index goes up, say 10, an SP fund should go up closer to 12. For a fund holder, youd normally see a declared dividend and cap gain distribution toward the end of each year. When you hold shares in a 401k, dividends are reinvested into the fund, usually with no involvement from the members.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Buying my first car out of college,"Generally speaking, buying a fancy new car out of college is dumb. Buying a 3 year old flashy car with a 60 month loan is going to eat up your income, and when the thing starts breaking down, youll get sick of buying 900 mufflers and 1,000 taillights pretty quickly.

Youre posting to a QA site about money, and youre asking if spending over 30k dont forget taxes on a luxury car when youre making 60k is a good idea. You have car fever, and youre trying to sell this transaction as a good deal from a financial POV. At the end of the day, there is no scenario where buying an expensive car is a good financial transaction. For example, since youre planning on driving too many miles for a lease to make sense, the certified preowned warranty is a nonfactor, because youll have no warranty when the car breaks down in 4 years.

Why do put option prices go higher when the underlying stock tanks drops?,"There are two components of option valuation, the value thats ""in the money"" and the ""time value."" In the case of the 395 put, that option was already in the money and it will move less than the stock price by a bit as there will still be some time value there. 22.52 is intrinsic value the right word for in the money and the rest is time. The 365 strike is still out of the money, but as jldugger implied, the chance of it going through that strike is better as its 6.66 closer. Looking at the options chain gives you a better perspective on this. If Apple went up 20 Monday, and down 20 Tuesday, these prices would be higher as implied volatility would also go higher. Now, Id hardly call a drop of under 2 ""tanking"" but on the otherhand, Id not call the 25 jump in the option price skyrocketing. Options do this all the time.

How smart is it to really be 100 debt free?,"The responses here are excellent. Id add just a couple points. Debt is not generic. It ranges from low my HELOC is 2.5 to insane 24 credit card, anyone?. When I read about the obsession to be completely debt free, I ask questions. Are you saving in your 401k at least up to the match? I disagree with the ""debt is evil"" people who advise to ignore retirement savings while paying off every last debt. My company offers a dollar for dollar match on the first 5 of income deposited. So a 60K earner will see a 3000 deposit doubled. 5 years of this, and he has 12 a years income in his retirement account, more with positive returns. note  for those so fearful of losses, all 401k accounts have to offer a fixed income, low risk choice. currently 1 or less, but the opposite of ""I can lose it all"". After that, paying off the higher debt is great. When its time to hack away at student debt and mortgage, I am concerned that if its at the risk of having no savings, Id hold off. Consider  Two people in homes worth 250K. One has a mortgage of 250K and 100K in the bank. The other has his mortgage paid down to 150K. When they lose their jobs, the guy with the 100K in the bank has the funds to float himself through a period of unemployment as well as a house the bank is less likely to foreclose on. The guy with no money is in deep trouble, and the bank can sell his house for 150K and run away after proper foreclosure proceedings of course. My mortgage is one bill, like any other, and only a bit more than my property tax. I dont lose sleep over it. It will be paid before I retire, and before my 11yr old is off to college.

Buying a multifamily home to rent part and live in the rest,"Others have already made good points, so Ill just add a few more You say that if you bought it, your mortgage, insurance, and taxes minus the rental income from the bottom floor would leave you with costs of 14 of your current rent. That means youre getting a fantastic deal on the purchase price. I suspect you may be underestimating some of those costs. So, get exact figures on the mortgage, insurance and taxes and do the math. If it is that good, go for it, just make sure to get that home inspection in case theres major problems and theyre trying to get out while the gettins good Also, some advice Be prepared to cover that entire monthly cost for a few months. Units can stand empty for a while. Also, you may want to rent out slowly  a good tenent found after a couple months is much better than a bad tenent found quickly. Also, have some money set aside for maintenence. As a renter, youve never really had to think about that before, but as a homeowner you do. As a landlord, its even more important  you can not fix something in your own home for a while if you needed to wait, but in a tenent unit, you have to fix it immediately. Finally, taxes You do get to deduct interest, and so on, but itll work a little differently than you think. Youll have to split it in half if the units are the same size and deduct half the interest as a normal homeowner deduction, the other half as a business expense. Same for PMI, insurance, and property taxes. If you do maintenance that effects both units, like fixing the roof, half will be deductible, the other half not. However, maintenance that only affects the tenant unit is fully deductible. You can claim depreciation, but only for half. So, your starting amount you can depreciate would be purchase price  land value2. Same thing here  half is your home, the other half is a business. Note that some things youd think of as maintenance costs actually cant be deducted, only depreciated over time. Take that leaky roof, for example. If you replaced it instead of repairing it, you could not deduct your replacement costs. It counts as an improvement, and gets added to your costbasis, where you depreciate it along with half! the house. If your tenants refrigerator went out, and you replaced it, you couldnt deduct that either. However you can depreciate all of it on another schedule seperate from home depreciation. If you repaired it instead, you can deduct all of it immediately.

Investing in the stock market during periods of high inflation,"The relation between inflation and stock or economic performance is not wellunderstood. Decades ago, economists thought inflation corresponded with periods of high growth and good real returns, but since then we have had periods of low inflation and high growth and high inflation with low growth. It is generally understood among current economists that inflation levels especially expected inflation are neither indicative nor causative of real stock returns. Many things can affect inflation, and economic performance is only a minor one. Many things can cause economic performance, and inflation is only a minor one. Its not clear whether the overall relation between inflation and real stock returns is positive or negative. Notice, however, that in principle stock returns are real. That is, the money companies make is in inflated dollars so profit and dividends for a company whose prospects have not changed should go up and down at the same rate as inflation. This would mean if inflation goes up by 5 and nothing else changes, you would expect stock prices to go up by the same proportion so you wouldnt have strong feelings about inflation one way or the other. In real life stock prices will go up by either more or less than 5 but Im not comfortable saying which, on average. Bottom line current levels of inflation cant really be used to predict real stock returns, so you shouldnt let current inflation guide your decision about whether to buy stock.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Investing in the stock market during periods of high inflation?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why are some countries currencies weaker? ,"You may as well ask why a piece of wood is 25 centimeters long but only 10 inches. Most units of measure are very arbitrary. Somebody decides that this amount of heat or distance or money is a convenient unit, and so thats what they use. Suppose that tomorrow the government issued a whole new currency that had 10 times the value of the old currency. So if you used to make 10,000 foobars a year, now you make 1,000 new foobars. And likewise the price of everything you buy is divided by 10. If a certain model car used to cost 2,000 foobars, now it costs 200 new foobars. Are you better or worse off? Clearly if ALL prices change by the same percentage, then it makes absolutely no difference. Aside from the hassle of making the switch and getting used to the new numbers. A currency where 1 unit of money buys more is not necessarily a ""stronger currency"". Any more than inches are ""better"" than centimeters because you get more wood for an inch than you get for a centimeter. A currency is said to be ""strong"" when its value is stable or increasing relative to other currencies. If yesterday I could trade 10 foobars for 1 plugh, but today I only need 9 foobars to buy 1 plugh, then foobars are stronger than plughs.

Why is retirement planning so commonly recommended?,"You dont have to retire. But the US government and other national governments have programs that allow you to set aside money when you are young to be used when you are older. To encourage you to do this, they reduce your taxes either now or when your are older. They also allow your employer to match your funds. In the US they have IRAs, 401Ks, and Social Security. You are not required to stop working while tapping into these funds. Having a job and using these funds will impact your taxes, but your are not forbidden from doing both. Decades ago most retirement funds come from pensions and Social Security. Most people are going to reach their senior years without a pension, or with only a very small pension because they had one in one of their early jobs. So go ahead, gamble that you will not need to save for retirement. Then hope that decades later you were right about it, because you cant go back in time and fix your choice. Some never save for retirement, either because they cant or they think they cant. Many that dont save end up working longer than they imagined.

At what point should I go into credit card debt?,"Financially, it simply doesnt make sense to go into debt here.

Id write in great detail, except this site is about finance, so lets limit the scope a little. Youve had therapy. It hasnt produced meaningful change. Stop with that therapy its not costeffective. Financially speaking, your goal should be to get back on your feet. You should only be willing to take on credit card debt if it is very, very directly helping you accomplish this. Maybe that means a different therapist. Maybe that means paying for medication, which can often be breathtakingly effective. Heck, maybe thats a suit, something you put on each morning for a couple of hours to focus on getting a job. Maybe that means some other approach. But you should only be willing to take on debt that directly helps you get back on your feet. Should you be willing to continue as you are now, taking on credit card debt for your living expenses? No, definitely not. Credit cards charge obscene amounts of interest, and the evidence is that your current approach is not working. Going into debt in this case makes as much sense as it did for me to continue working for an employer who wasnt paying me. That is, none at all financially.

Wells Fargo Brokerage has no shares of stock to short,"This is the birds eye view of how shorting works When you place an order to sell a stock short, your broker attempts to grab the desired number of shares from any accounts of its other customers and makes them available for you to sell.

Your odds are better if the particular stock has a large float i.e. a large number of shares that are actually available for trading and its short ratio is low which means relatively few shares are currently being sold short. Also, a large brokerage may be more likely to have access to the shares than a small nichemarket broker. The example youve given, Angies List ANGI is a 600M smallcap with a comparatively low float, and though I havent been able to glean the short ratio, it appears that a lot of investors are bearish on this stock and probably already had the same idea to short it.

Does this sound like a great idea regarding being a landlord and starting a real estate empire?,"This is a well worn path and not a bad idea. There are quite a few pitfalls but there are a lot of resources to learn for other peoples mistakes. Having a plan and doing your research should help you avoid most of them. Here is some general advice to help get you started on the right foot. Know the market you are investing in. The city should have more than one major employer. The population should be rising and hopefully there are other positive economic indicators. Check the citys and states chamber of commerce for useful information. You do not want to be stuck holding a bunch of upside down property in Detroit. Accurately calculate expenses. Set aside money for repairs. budget 5 of the rent or 100 a month for repairs if no repairs happen that money goes into the repair fund for the future. Set aside money for capital expenditures if the roof has a 10 years of life left in 10 years you better be ready to replace it same with any major appliances. Your area should have a baseline vacancy rate 58 in my area. That says out of a year your property will be vacant for around 6 of the year or 21 days for turnover. You should build that cushion into the budget as well setting aside a portion of the rent to cover that lean period. Some property management will offer ""eviction insurance"" which is basically them enforcing that savings. Financing maybe difficult a lot of banks like to see 25 down payments on investments. You will also face higher interest rates for investment properties. Banks generally also like to see enough money to cover 6 months worth of expenses in your account for all property. Some banks will not give financing for investment property to someone without 12 years of landlord experience. All in all finding money will be hard when you gets started and your terms may be less than ideal. hopefully make around 3  5k a year in profit If that includes loan paydown and is not just cashflow you are probably in the right ballpark. I can find 100200 dollars cashflow a month on single family home in my area. Once loan paydown is included your numbers are close. It sounds like you have a good attitude and a good plan.

How to protect myself against unauthorized recurring CC charges?,"The bank SHOULD be able to issue you a new card without letting vendors roll over the recurring payments. In fact, Ive never had a bank move recurring payments to a new card automatically, or even upon request theyve always told me to contact the vendor and give them my new card number. So go back to the bank, tell them specifically that you have a security issue and you want the new card issued WITHOUT carrying over any recurring charges, and see if they can do it properly. If not 1 Issue a ""charge back"" every time a bogus charge comes in. This costs the vendor money, and should convince them to stop trying to access your card. Its a hassle because you have to keep contacting the bank about the bad charges, but it wont cost you more than time and a phone call or letter.

Perhaps they could do it as a perk when you do something else with them like get a mortgage or keep 1000 in your chequing account all the time.

Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment?,"This does not directly address the question, but how the Bank views your behaviour is not the same as a credit reporting bureau. If you do not ""go deep"" on your card at all, you may be deemed not to be exercising the facility, indeed they may ask you to reduce your credit limit. This is not the same as ""missing a payment"". At the same time, do not just make the minimum payment. Ideally you should clear it within 3 months. Think of it as a very short term line of credit. Not clearing the balance within three months or turning it over demonstrates a cash flow problem, as does clearing it from another card. Some banks call this ""kite flying"" after similar behaviour in older days with cheque accounts. If you use the credit and show you can pay it off, you should never need to ask for a credit increase, it will be offered. The Bureau will be informed of these offers. Also, depending upon how much the bank trusts you, the Bureau may see a ""monthly"" periodic credit review, which is good if you have no delinquencies.

"When youre really young and have about 2K to start investing  for retirement, why do some people advise you to go risky?","First of all, ""going risky"" doesnt mean driving to Las Vegas and playing roulette. The real meaning is that you can afford higher riskreturn ratio compared to a person who will retire in the following ten years. Higher return is very important since time works for you and even several extra percent annually will make a big difference in the long run because of compound interest effect. The key is that this requires the investment to not be too risky  if you invest in a single venture and it fails you lose all the money and thats worse that some conservative investment that could yield minimum income. So you still need the investment to be relatively safe. Next, as user Chris W. Rea mentions in the comment funds and ETFs can be very risky  depending on the investment policy they can invest into some very risky ventures or into some specific industry and that poses more risk that investing into ""blue chips"" for example. So a fund or an ETF can be a good fit for you if you choose a right one.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: When youre really young and have about 2K to start investing  for retirement, why do some people advise you to go risky?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Using credit cards online is it safe?,"Why do online services ask for all those CVV codes and expiration date information, if, whenever you poke the card out of your wallet, all of its information becomes visible to everyone in the close area? What can I do to secure myself? Id guess thats to protect the card company, not you. The number of the card is guessable, but each other bit of information makes it much harder to guess the CVV code makes it 1000 times harder, the expiration date makes it about 50100 times harder. Since you wouldnt be responsible for the payment anyway, adding security for online transactions provides the company with less liability. As for the security of your information online, thats trickier. It depends entirely on the site youre using whether theyve implemented the appropriate security measures or not and, given the SSL attacks weve seen, even that might not help. source Im a web developer, and have worked on payments systems before that implemented the security mandated by the cards.

Do I pay a zero  loan before another to clear both loans faster?,"Allen, welcome to Money.SE. Youve stumbled into the issue of Debt Snowball, which is the ""low balance"" method of paying off debt. The other being ""high interest."" I absolutely agree that when one has a pile of cards, say a dozen, there is a psychological benefit to paying off the low balances and knocking off card after card. I am not dismissive of that motivation. Personal Finance has that first word, personal, and one size rarely fits all. For those who are numbersoriented, its worth doing the math, a simple spreadsheet showing the cost of the DS vs paying by rate. If that cost is even a couple hundred dollars, Ill still concede that one less payment, envelope, stamp, etc, favors the DS method. On the other hand, theres the debt so large that the best payoff is 2 or 3 years away. During that time, 10000 paid toward the 24 card is saving you 2400yr vs the 500 if paid toward 5 debt. Hard core DSers dont even want to discuss the numbers, strangely enough. In your case, you dont have a pile of anything. The mortgage isnt even up for discussion. You have just 2 car loans. Send the 11,000 to the 19K loan carrying the 2.5. This will save you 500 over the next 2 years vs paying the zero loan down. Once youve done that, the remaining 8000 will become your lowest balance, and you should flip to the Debt Snowball method, which will keep you paying that debt off. DS is a tool that should be pulled out for the masses, the radio audience that The David Dave Ramsey, radio show host appeals to. They may comprise the majority of those with high credit card debt, and have greatest success using this method. But, you exhibit none of their symptoms, and are best served by the math. By bringing up the topic here, youve found yourself in the same situation as the guy who happens to order a white wine at a wedding, and finds his Mormon cousin offering to take him to an AA meeting the next day. In past articles on this decision, Ive referenced a spreadsheet one can download. It offers an easy way to see your choice without writing your own excel doc. For the situation described here, the low balance total interest is 546 vs 192 for the higher interest. Not quite the 500 difference I estimated. The 350 difference is low due to the small rate difference and relatively short payoffs. In my opinion, knowledge is power, and you can decide either way. Whats important is that if you pay off the zero interest first, you can say ""I knew it was a 350 difference, but Id rather have just one outstanding loan for the remain time."" My issue with DS is when its preached like a religion, and followers are told to not even run the numbers. I wrote an article, Thinking about Dave Ramsey a number of years back, but the topic never gets old.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Do I pay a zero  loan before another to clear both loans faster?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What exactly happens during a settlement period?,"During the settlement period, the buyer transfers payment to the seller and the seller transfers ownership to the buyer. This is really a holdover from the days when so much of stock trading was done by individual human traders, and computers were still not a huge part of the operation. Back then, paper tickets for trades exchanged hands, and the time period was actually 5 days, so 3 days is an improvement. A settlement period was necessary for everyone to figure out their trades and do what was necessary to make the settlements happen, so it was not always a quick process, mainly because of smaller trading firms that didnt have technology to help them along. Nowadays, technology makes settlements easy, and they usually occur at the end of the trading day. The trading firms sum up their trades, figure out who they owe, and send lump sum settlements to the counterparties to their trades. If anything, the 3day period may just be used now to let parties verify trades before settling. I hope this helps.

Discount Rate vs. IRR,"The IRR is the Discount Rate r that makes Net Present Value NPVr0. What this boils down to is two ways of making the same kind of profitability calculation. You can choose a project with NPV100, or you can choose based on IRR10, and the idea is you get to the same set of projects. Thats if everything is well behaved mathematically. But thats not the end of this story of finance, math, and alphabet soup. For investments that have multiple positive and negative cash flows, finding that r becomes solving for the roots of a polynomial in r, so that there can be multiple roots. Usually people use the lowest positive root but really it only makes sense for projects where NPVr0 for rr. To try to help with your understanding, you can evaluate a real estate project with r10, find the sum future discounted cash flows, which is the NPV, and do the project if NPV0. Or, you can take the future cash flows of a project, find the NPV as a function of the rate r, and find r where NPVr0. That r is the IRR. If IRRr10 and the NPV function is well behaved as above, you can also do the project. When we dont have to worry about multiple roots, the preceding two paragraphs will select the same identical sets of projects as meeting the 10 return requirement.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Discount Rate vs. IRR?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Should I collect receipts after paying with a card?,"In this answer, I wont elaborate on the possibilities of fraud or pure human error, because something can always go wrong. I will, however, explain why I think you should always keep receipts. When the monthly or so time comes to pay your credit card bill, your credit card company sends you a list of transactions. That list has two primary purposes, both of which I would consider equally important While for the former item, a receipt is not necessary though it certainly does not hurt showing the receipt along with the bill to provide further proof that the payment was indeed connected to that bill, the latter point does require you to store the receipts so you can check, itembyitem, whether each of the sums is correct and matched with a receipt at all. So, unless you can actually memorize all the credit card transactions you did throughout the past one or two months, the receipts are the most convenient way of keeping that information until the bill arrives. Yes, your credit card company probably has some safeguards in place to reveal fraud, which might kick in in time the criteria are mostly heuristical, it seems, with credit cards or legitimate transactions here getting blocked every now and then simply because some travelling of the actual owner was misinterpreted as theft. However, it is your money, it is your responsibility to discover any issues with the bill, just as you would check the monthly transaction list from your bank account line by line. Ultimately, that is why you sign the vendor copy of the receipt when buying something offline if you discover an issue in your list of transactions, you have to notify your credit card company that you dispute one of the charges, and then the charging vendor has to show that they have your signature for the respective transaction. So, to summarize Do keep your receipts, use them to check the list of transactions before paying your credit card bill. EDIT The receipt often cannot be replaced with the bill from the vendor. The bill is useful for seeing how the sum charged by the respective vendor was created, but in turn, such bills often do not contain any payment information, or when payment was concluded before the bill was printed, as sometimes happens in prepaid scenarios such as hotel booking nondescript remarks such as "" PAYMENT RECEIVED "", without any further indication of which one of your credit cards, debit cards, bank accounts, stored value cards, or cash was used.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Should I collect receipts after paying with a card?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does remittance work? How does it differ from direct money transfer?,"The Option 2 in your answer is how most of the money is moved cross border. It is called International Transfer, most of it carried out using the SWIFT network. This is expensive, at a minimum it costs in the range of USD 30 to USD 50. This becomes a expensive mechanism to transfer small sums of money that individuals are typically looking at. Over a period of years, the low value payments by individuals between certain pair of countries is quite high, example USIndia, USChina, MiddleEastIndia, USMexico etc ... With the intention to reduce cost, Banks have built a different workflow, this is the Option 1. This essentially works on getting money from multiple individuals in EUR. The aggregated sum is converted into INR, then transferred to partner Bank in India via Single SWIFT. Alongside the partner bank is also sent a file of instructions having the credit account. The Partner Bank in India will use the local clearing network [these days NEFT] to credit the funds to the Indian account. Option 3 Other methods include you writing a check in EUR and sending it over to a friendrelative in India to deposit this into Indian Account. Typically very nominal costs. Typically one month of timelines. Option 4 Another method would be to visit an Indian Bank and ask them to issue a ""Rupee DraftBankers Check"" payable in India.

Because he was a client for your current business, it can blur the lines. Second, if you join him, make sure there is a business entity. By working together for profit, you will have already formed a partnership for tax purposes. Best to get an entity, both for the legal protection and also for the clarity of law and accounting. LLCs are simplest for small ventures C corps are useful if you have lots of early losses and owners that cant use them personally, or if you want to be properly formed for easy consumption by a strategic. Most VCs and superangels prefer everybody be a straight C. Again, remember to define, as necessary, what you are contributing to be an owner and what you are retaining your original business, which for simplicity may already be in an entity. As part of this process, make sure he defines the cap table and any outstanding loans. Auntie June and Cousin Steve might think their gifts to him were loans or equity purchases best to clear this issue up early before theres any more money in it. Third, with regard to price, that is an intensely variable question. It matters what the cap table looks like, how early you are, how much work hes already done, how much work remains to be done, and how much it will pay off. Also, if you do it, expect to be diluted by other employees, angels, VCs, other investors, strategics, and so on. Luckily, more investors usually indicates a growing pie, so the dilution may not be at all painful. But it should still be on your horizon. You also need to consider your faith in your prospective partners ability to run the business and to be a trustworthy partner so you dont get Zuckerbergd, and to market the business and the product to customers and investors. If you dont like the prospects, then opt for cash. If you like the business but want to hedge, ask for compensation plus equity. There are other tricks you could use to get out early, like forced redemption, but they probably wouldnt help either because itd sour your relationship or the first VC or knowledgeable angel to come along will want you to relinquish that sort of right. It probably comes down to a basic question of your need for cash, his willingness to let you pursue outside work hopefully high and your appraisal of the business prospects.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Be a partner, CTO or just a freelancer?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is a negotiable security and how are they related to derivatives?,"negotiability is a legal concept that permits free transfer of a security without the requirement of prior consent of the issuer. that means the issuer must pay the current holder of the security, irrespective of who he is. negotiability also protects a good faith buyer of the instrument from adverse ownership claims of purported prior holders of the instrument. it is not related to ""negotiating"" the price or whatnot. A negotiable security means the current owner does not have to be concerned about acquiring the asset via a bad chain of title bc he can always assert that he is a ""holder in due course"" defense against such claims, and have absolute security in his ownership right over the asset. securities and derivatives are different. securities are transferrable instruments representing a direct claim on the issuer for the value of the security, whether debt or equity ownership. derivatives are bilateral contracts, which can only be entered into with the consent of both parties, and can only be transferred by such consent. derivatives represent a claim against the parties of to the derivative that depends on some economic reference which is outside of the financial condition of the two parties to the contract, such as interest rates, FX rates, commodity prices, etc.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is a negotiable security and how are they related to derivatives?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is investing into real estate a good move for a riskaverse person at the moment,"Ill add this to what the other answers said if you are a renter now, and the real estate you want to buy is a house to live in, then it may be worth it  in a currency devaluation, rent may increase faster than your income. If you pay cash for the home, you also have the added benefit of considerably reducing your monthly housing costs. This makes you more resilient to whatever the future may throw at you  a lower paying job, for instance, or high inflation that eats away at the value of your income. If you get a mortgage, then make sure to get a fixed interest rate. In this case, it protects you somewhat from high inflation because your mortgage payment stays the same, while what you would have had to pay in rent keeps going up an up. In both cases there is also taxes and insurance, of course. And those would go up with inflation. Finally, do make sure to purchase sensibly. A good rule of thumb on how much you can afford to pay for a home is 2.5x  3.5x your annual income. I do realize that there are some areas where its common for people to buy homes at a far greater multiple, but that doesnt mean its a sensible thing to do. Also Ill second what sheegaon said if youre really worried about the euro collapsing, it might give you some peace of mind to move some money into UK Gilts or US Treasuries.

Short term cutting losses in a long term investment,"If you are investing for 10 years, then you just keep buying at whatever price the fund is at. This is called dollarcost averaging. If the fund is declining in value from when you first bought it, then when you buy more, the AVERAGE price you bought in at is now lower. So therefore your losses are lower AND when it goes back up you will make more. Even if it continues to decline in value then you keep adding more money in periodically, eventually your position will be so large that on the first uptick you will have a huge percent gain.

How can I withdraw money from my LLC?,"Generally, unless you explicitly elect otherwise, LLCs are transparent when it comes to taxes.

What are the options for a 19yearold college student who only has about 1000?,"Kid, you need to start thinking in thresholds. There are several monetary thresholds that separate your class from a more well funded class. 1 You cannot use margin with less than 2000 dollars Brokers require that you have at least 2000 before they will lend to you 2 In 2010, Congress banned under 21 year olds from getting access to credit. UNLESS they get cosigned. This means that even if you have 2000, no broker will give you margin unless you have a good credit history already. There was a good reason for this, but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid, not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers. 3 The brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions. The commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your 1000. For the most part. 4 The pattern day trader rule. You cannot employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule. It basically limits you from trading 3 times a day its more complicated than that read it yourself if you have less than 25,000 in one account. 5 Nontrade or stock related investments Buy municipal or treasury bonds. They will give you more than a savings account would, and municipals are tax free. This isnt exactly what I would call liquid though  ie. if you wanted to access your money to invest in something else on a whim. 6 What are you studying? If its anything technical then you might get a good idea that you could risk your money on to create value. But I would stick to high growth stocks before blowing your 1000 on an idea. Thats not exactly what I would call ""access to capital"". 7 Arbitrage. Lets say you know a friend that buys the trendy collectors shoes at discount and sells them for a profit. He might do this with one 200 pair of tennis shoes, and then use the 60 profit different to go buy video games for himself. If he wanted to scale up, he couldnt because he never has more than 200 to play with. In comparison, you could do 5 pairs 200 x 5 and immediately have a larger operation than him, making a larger profit 60 x 5  300, now you have 1300 and could do it again with 6 pairs to make an even great er profit not because you are better or worked at it, but solely because you have more capital to start with. Keep an eye out for arbitrage opportunities, usually there is a good reason they exist if you notice it the market is too small and illiquid to scale up with, or the entire market will be saturated the next day.

Is it true that 90 of investors lose their money?,"Very likely this refers to tradingspeculating on leverage, not investing.

At least here in Europe I can trade index CFDs and other leveraged products. If i trade lets say 501 leverage it doesnt take much to get a margin call andor position closed by the broker. No doubt, depending on which investments you choose theres always risk, but currency is a position too.

What to think of two at the money call options with different strike prices and premiums?,"As other uses have pointed out, your example is unusual in that is does not include any time value or volatility value in the quoted premiums, the premiums you quote are only intrinsic values. For well inthemoney options, the intrinsic value will certainly be the vast majority of the premium, but not the sole component. Having said that, the answer would clearly be that the buyer should buy the 40 call at a premium of 10. The reason is that the buyer will pay less for the option and therefore risk less money, or buy more options for the same amount of money. Since the buyer is assuming that the price will rise, the return that will be realised will be the same in gross terms, but higher in relative terms for the buyer of the 40 call. For example, if the underlying price goes to 60, then the buyer of the 40 call would potentially double their money when the premium goes from 10 to 20, while the buyer of the 30 call would realise a potential 50 profit when the premium goes from 20 to 30. Considering the situation beyond your scenario, things are more difficult if the bet goes wrong. If the underlying prices expires at under 40, then the buyer of the 40 call will be better off in gross terms but may be worse off in relative terms if it expires above 30. If the underlying price expires between 40 and 50, then the buy of the 30 will be better off in relative term, having lost a smaller percentage of their money.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What to think of two at the money call options with different strike prices and premiums?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do people always talk about stocks that pay high dividends?,"When you invest in stocks, there are two possible ways to make money Many people speculate just on the stock price, which would result in a gain or loss, but only once you have resold the shares. Others dont really care about the stock price. They get dividends every so often, and hopefully, the return will be better than other types of investments. If youre in there for the long run, you do not really care what the price of the stock is. It is often highly volatile, and often completely disconnected from anything, so its not because today you have a theoretical gain because the current stock price is higher than your buying price that you will effectively realise that gain when you sell need I enumerate the numerous crashes that prevented this from happening?. Returns will often be more spectacular on share resale than on dividends, but it goes both ways you can lose a lot if you resell at the wrong time. Dividends tend to be a bit more stable, and unless the company goes bankrupt or a few other unfortunate events, you still hold shares in the company even if the price goes down, and you could still get dividends. And you can still resell the stock on top of that! Of course, not all companies distribute dividends.

Even if a few turn you down, some will do it. You might say that an agent isnt going to be as accurate as an appraiser, and you are right. There is also an expectation that they will evaluate higher than the real value, to persuaade you to sell. That probably isnt a big issue, and its something you can compensate for. And even an appraiser is going to be based somewhat on speculation.

If you are really ""missing your payment"", paying late more than a few days, less than minimum or nothing at all, this wont help to improve your credit.

Should I set a stop loss for long term investments?,"This is the exactly wrong thing to do especially in the age of algorithmic trading. Consider this event from 2010 Chart Source Another similar event occurred in 2015 and there was also a currency flash crash in that year. As you can see the SP 500 and basically the entire market dropped nearly 7 in a matter of minutes. It regained most of that value within 15 minutes. If you are tempted to think that 7 isnt that big of a deal, you need to understand that specific securities will have a much bigger drop during such events. For example the PowerShares SP 500 Low Volatility ETF SPLV was down 45 at one point on Aug 24, 2015 but closed less than 6 down. Consider what effect a stop loss order would have on your portfolio in that circumstance. You would not be able to react fast enough to buy at the bottom. The advantage of longterm investing is that you are immune to such aberrations. Additionally, as asked by others, what do you do once youve pulled out your money. Do you wait for a big jump in the market and hop back in? The risk here is that you are on the sidelines for the gains.

US tax for a resident NRI,"Please declare everything you earn in India as well as the total amount of assets its called FBAR. The penalties for not declaring is jail time no matter how small the amount and lots of ordinary people every 23 years are regularly sent to jail for not declaring such income. Its taken very seriously by the IRS  and any Indian bank who has an office in the US or does business here, can be asked by IRS to provide any bank account details for you. You will get deductions for taxes already paid to a foreign country due to double taxation, so there wont be any additional taxes because income taxes in US are on par or even lower than that in India. Using tricks like transferring ownership to your brother may not be worth it. Note you pay taxes only when you realize gains anyway  both in India or here, so why do you want to take such hassles. If you transfer to your brother, it will be taxed only until you hold them. Make sure you have exact dates of gains between the date you came to US and the date you ""gifted"" to your brother. As long as you clearly document that the stocks transferred to your brother was a gift and you have no more claims on them, it should be ok, but best to consult a CPA in the US. If you have claims on them, example agreement that you will repurchase them, then you will still continue to pay taxes. If you sell your real estate investments in India, you have to pay tax on the gains in the US and you need proof of the original buying cost and your sale. If you have paid taxes on the real estate gains in India, then you can get deduction due to double tax avoidance treaty.

Does an industry standard have any affect on when a stock might split?,"You ask if Tesla being a car company should feel a pressure to split their stock because their share price is much higher than the other car companies. But is Tesla a car company? It was founded by Elon Musk who founded PayPal and SpaceX. He sees him self as the next generation of entrepreneurs that came after Jobs and Gates. So he compares Tesla 142 companies to Google 856, Amazon 284 and eBay 52. But even if you see Tesla as a car company, Musk sees it more like Audi 828 or BMW 100 then he does Ford 16.30 just because the base price of their models 80,000 is much greater than Ford or GM. The theory is that keeping the share price in a lower range helps investors. But since 40 of the company is owned by mutual funds is that really a concern?

How to resolve imbalances and orphan transactions in Gnucash?,"I have been following some of these threads. Some of them are really old. I have read used recording to equity accounts to resolve the imbalance USD issue. The thing I noticed is that all my imbalances occur when paying bills. I took all the bills and set them up as vendor accounts, entered the bills in the new bills, and used the process payment when paying bills. The imbalance issue stopped. It makes sense. The system is a double entry. Thats it will credit and debit. Assets accounts are increased with a debit and decreased with a credit. Equity accounts are increased with a credit and decreased with a debit. ie Say you have an monthly insurance bill for 100. You enter it into the new vendor bill. This credits Accounts Payable. When paying the bill it credits checking, debits account payable, credits vendor account, debits the expense insurance. In short for each credit there has to be a debit for the books to balance.

Should I wait a few days to sell ESPP Stock?,"It depends on how the program is run. If the company runs the program out of treasury stock shares that are authorized, but not issued, then there arent any shares being purchased on the open market. Because of that, the share price wouldnt be affected. If you look in your employers annual report, you will probably find how the program is run and how many shares are issued annually under that program. By comparing that to the daily trading volume of the companys stock you can gauge whether theres any likelihood of the share price being affected by the employee purchases. That is, of course, if shares are being purchased on the open market. For example, here is BooksAMillions program, as described in their 2011 annual report Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan under which shares of the Companys common stock are reserved for purchase by employees at 85 of the fair market value of the common stock at the lower of the market value for the Companys stock as of the beginning of the fiscal year or the end of the fiscal year. On May 20, 2010, the stockholders of the Company approved an additional 200,000 shares available for issuance under the plan, bringing the aggregate number of shares that may be awarded to 600,000. Of the total reserved shares, 391,987, 373,432 and 289,031 shares have been purchased as of January 29, 2011, January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. This describes an instance of the employee purchase program being run from unissued stock, not open market purchases. From it, we can tell 18,555 shares were issued during the past fiscal year. As their average daily volume is 40,000 shares, if the program were run from a single open market purchase, it would have potential to ""move the market"". One would think, though, that a company running it from open market purchases would spread the purchases over a period of time to avoid running up the price on themselves.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Should I wait a few days to sell ESPP Stock?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Mortgage or not?,"Here is something that should help your decision Currently you are 57, suppose that means that you will still work for 10 years, and then be retired for another 20 before you sell the house. Your retirement account is nearly flat, so you will have to support yourself with your own income.

If you get a mortgage where you only pay nett 3 interest no payback of the loan, that would cost you 6k per year on interest based on 350k150k, if you also want to pay back the 200k difference within 30 years, it would totally be close to 13k in annual interestpayback. Now consider whether you would rather live on 40k per year in your current place, or on a lower amount in a bigger place.

Is it smart to only invest in mid and smallcap stock equity funds in my 401k?,"Your initial premise midcap and smallcap company stocks have outperformed the market is partially correct  they have, over many 40 yr periods, provided higher returns than large caps or bond funds. The important thing to consider here is that risk adjusted, the returns from a diversified portfolio are far more robust  with proper asset allocation you and expect high returns and reduce your risk simultaneously. Imagine this scenario  you decide to stick to small  mid caps for 10  15 yrs and move into a more diversified portfolio then. Had you made that decision during a sustained period of poor small cap performance late 80s or the 40s you would have lost a boatload of return, as those were periods were small  mids underperformed the market as a whole, and large caps in particular. As an example, from 1946 to 1958 large caps outperformed small every single year. If 2016 were to be the first year of a similar trend, youve done yourself a major disservice. Since the dot com crash small mids have outperformed for sure, pretty much every year  but that doesnt mean that they will continue to do so. The reason asset allocation exists is precisely this  over a 40 yr period, no single asset class outperforms a diversified portfolio. If you attempt to time the market, even if you do so with a multidecade time horizon in mind, there a good chance that you will do more poorly.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

"In the stock market, why is the open price value never the same as previous days close?","Besides overnight news events and auction mechanisms there is a more fundamental reason the price of a stock is always moving. Theoretically the stock price will move slightly even in the unlikely scenario that absolutely nothing of interest happens during the entire night. Let me go into that in some more detail Stock valuation using Discounted Cash FLow One of the fundamental reasons that stock value is constantly changing is because underneath every stock there is a company that expects to make some kind of profit or loss in the future. We have to go into the fundamentals of stock value to understand why this is important One popular way to determine the value of a stock is by looking into the future and summing up all the earnings or cashflows it has yet to produce. You have to reduce each amount by a certain factor that gets larger for payments that are farther into the future. Think of it this way a dollar in hand now is better than a dollar that you get tomorrow. This method of valuation is called Discounted Cash Flow abbr. DCF see the wikipedia article on DCF Times effect on stock value Now take the Close price C, and the open price O. Lets assume that since there has been no news, the expectations for future earnings are the same for C and O. Remember that the discounting factor for these earnings is dependent on the time until the cashflow occurs? For O, this time is slightly shorter than for C, and therefore the value will be slightly higher or lower, when the company is expected to incur losses. So now you can see that even without all the external forces that continuously push and pull on the stock price, a stock still changes in value over time.

Avoid Capital Gains on Rental,"Just brainstorming here, but my gut feeling is it should be possible to sell your home to yourself with the sole purpose of resetting your basis. Taken at face value it feels illegal, but since I think we all would agree that you could sell your house to a third party and purchase the identical house next door for the same price thus resetting your basis, why cant you purchase the same home right back? If one is legal, it seems odd for the other not to be. That being said, I have no idea how to legally do it. Perhaps you truly need a third party to step in which you sell it to, and then buy it back from them sometime in the future. Or perhaps you could start an LLC and have it purchase your home from you.

Who creates money? Central banks or commercial banks? ,"A central bank typically introduces new money into the system by printing new money to purchase items from member banks. The central bank can purchase whatever it chooses. It typically purchases government bonds but the Federal Reserve purchased mortgagebackedsecurities MBS during the 2008 panic since the FED was the only one willing to pay full price for MBS after the crash of 2008. The bank, upon receipt of the new money, can loan the money out. A minimum reserve ratio specifies how much money the bank has to keep on hand. A reserve ratio of 10 means the bank must have 10 for every 100 in loans. As an example, lets say the FED prints up some new money to purchase some office desks from a member bank. It prints 10,000 to purchase some desks. The bank receives 10,000. It can create up to 100,000 in loans without exceeding the 10 minimum reserve ratio requirement. How would it do so? A customer would come to the bank asking for a 100,000 loan. The bank would create an account for the customer and credit 100,000 to the customers account. There is a problem, however. The customer borrowed the money to buy a boat so the customer writes a check for 100,000 to the boat company. The boat company attempts to deposit the 100,000 check into the boat companys bank. The boat companys bank will ask the originating bank for 100,000 in cash. The originating bank only has 10,000 in cash on hand so this demand will immediately bankrupt the originating bank. So what actually happens? The originating bank actually only loans out reserves  1  minimum reserve ratio so it can meet demands for the loans it originates. In our example the bank that received the initial 10,000 from the FED will only loan out 10,000  10.1  9,000. This allows the bank to cover checks written by the person who borrowed the 9,000. The reserve ratio for the bank is now 1,0009,000 which is 11 and is over the minimum reserve requirement. The borrower makes a purchase with the borrowed 9,000 and the seller deposits the 9,000 in his bank. The bank that receives that 9,000 now has an additional 9,000 in reserves which it will use to create loans of 9,000  1  0.1  8100. This continual fractional reserve money creation process will continue across the entire banking system resulting in 100,000 of new money created from 10,000.

Am I exposed to currency risk when I invest in shares of a foreign company that are listed domestically?,"Yes, youre still exposed to currency risk when you purchase the stock on company Bs exchange. Im assuming youre buying the shares on Bs stock exchange through an ADR, GDR, or similar instrument. The risk occurs as a result of the process through which the ADR is created. In its simplest form, the process works like this Ill illustrate this with an example. Ive separated the conversion rate into the exchange rate and a generic ""ADR conversion rate"" which includes all other factors the bank takes into account when deciding how many ADR shares to sell. The fact that the units line up is a nice check to make sure the calculation is logically correct. My example starts with these assumptions I made up the generic ADR conversion rate it will remain constant throughout this example. This is the simplified version of the calculation of the ADR share price from the European share price Lets assume that the euro appreciates against the US dollar, and is now worth 1.4 USD this is a major appreciation, but it makes a good example The currency appreciation alone raised the share price of the ADR, even though the price of the share on the European exchange was unchanged. Now lets look at what happens if the euro appreciates further to 1.5 USDEUR, but the companys share price on the European exchange falls Even though the euro appreciated, the decline in the share price on the European exchange offset the currency risk in this case, leaving the ADRs share price on the US exchange unchanged. Finally, what happens if the euro experiences a major depreciation and the companys share price decreases significantly in the European market? This is a realistic situation that has occurred several times during the European sovereign debt crisis. Assuming this occurred immediately after the first example, European shareholders in the company experienced a 43.50  50  50  13 return, but American holders of the ADR experienced a 15.95  21.5093  21.5093  25.9 return. The currency shock was the primary cause of this magnified loss. Another point to keep in mind is that the foreign company itself may be exposed to currency risk if it conducts a lot of business in market with different currencies. Ideally the company has hedged against this, but if you invest in a foreign company through an ADR or a GDR or another similar instrument, you may take on whatever risk the company hasnt hedged in addition to the currency risk thats present in the ADRGDR conversion process. Here are a few articles that discuss currency risk specifically in the context of ADRs 1, 2. Nestle, a Swiss company that is traded on US exchanges through an ADR, even addresses this issue in their FAQ for investors. There are other risks associated with instruments like ADRs and crosslisted companies, but normally arbitrageurs will remove these discontinuities quickly. Especially for crosslisted companies, this should keep the prices of highly liquid securities relatively synchronized.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Am I exposed to currency risk when I invest in shares of a foreign company that are listed domestically?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"If throwing good money after bad is generally a bad idea, is throwing more money after good Ok?","Is investing more money into a stock that you already have a stake, in which has gone up in price a good idea? What you describe here is a good idea when the stock keeps uptrending. The way to do it is say you have originally bought 1000 worth of shares, then the next purchase you buy 500 worth, then 250 worth. It is called pyramiding into your trades. However, this system would not be the best with simply a buy and hold when you keep holding even if the price starts freefalling. You would need to have a trailing stop loss on your initial trade, and then as you buy each additional trade your trailing stop loss would incorporate the additional trade and move to a level where if you get stopped out you will make an overall profit. With each additional trade your trailing stop will move higher and higher for higher protected profits. The whole point behind pyramid trading is to keep buying more of a stock that keeps performing well to increase your profits. However, each additional purchase is half the previous one so that you dont eat too much into existing profits in the case of the uptrend reversing and so as to not overcapitalise on the one stock. So you are using part of your existing profits in an attempt to make more profits.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If throwing good money after bad is generally a bad idea, is throwing more money after good Ok?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Lump sum annuity distribution  do I owe estate tax?,"There can be Federal estate tax as well as State estate tax due on an estate, but it is not of direct concern to you. Estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent, not by the beneficiaries, and so you do not owe any estate tax. As a matter of fact, most estates in the US do not pay Federal estate tax at all because only the amount that exceeds the Federal exemption 5.5M is taxable, and most estates are smaller. State estate taxes might be a different matter because while many states exempt exactly what the Federal Government does, others exempt different usually smaller amounts. But in any case, estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax before distributing the inheritances. As JoeTaxpayers answer says more succinctly, what you inherit is net of estate tax, if any. What you receive as an inheritance is not taxable income to you either. If you receive stock shares or other property, your basis is the value of the property when you inherit it. Thus, if you sell at a later time, you will have to pay taxes only on the increase in the value of the property from the time you inherit it. The increase in value from the time the decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income to you. Exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment of Traditional IRAs, 401ks, pension plans etc that you inherit that contain money on which the decedent never paid income tax. Distributions from such inherited accounts are mostly taxable income to you any part of posttax money such as nondeductible contributions to Traditional IRAs that is included in the distribution is taxfree. Annuities present another source of complications. For annuities within IRAs, even the IRS throws up its hands at explaining things to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into Pub 950, saying in effect, talk to your tax advisor. For other annuities, questions arise such as is this a taxdeferred annuity and whether it was purchased with pretax money or with posttax money, etc. One thing that you should check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual payments. Annuities in particular have heavy surrender charges if they are terminated early and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance company issuing the annuity had planned on happening. So, taking a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the lump sum but because the increase in AGI might reduce deductions for medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized deductions that can be claimed, increase taxability of social security benefits, etc. You say that you have these angles sussed out, and so I will merely reiterate Beware the surrender charges.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Lump sum annuity distribution  do I owe estate tax?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does 1099 work with my own company,"Can I work on 1099 from my own company instead of on W2? The reason is on W2 I cant deduct my commute, Health Insurance and some other expenses while on 1099 I think I can able do that. Since I am going to client place to work not at my own office, I am not sure whether I should able to do that or not. If you have LLC, unless you elected to tax it as a corporation, you need neither 1099 nor W2. For tax purposes the LLC is disregarded. So it is, from tax perspective, a sole proprietorship or partnership, if multiple members. Being a W2 employee of your own LLC is a bad idea. For all these above expenses, which can I use companys debitcredit card or I need to use only my personal debitcredit card? It would be better to always use a business account for business purposes.

How can I avoid international wire fees or currency transfer fees?,"I havent seen this answer, and I do not know the legality of it, as it could raise red flags as to money laundering, but about the only way to get around the exchange rate spreads and fees is to enter into transactions with a private acquaintance who has Euros and needs Dollars. The problem here is that you are taking on the settlement risk in the sense that you have to trust that they will deposit the euros into your French account when you deposit dollars into their US account. If you work this out with a relative or very close friend, then the risk should be minimal, however a more casual acquaintance may be more apt to walk away from the transaction and disappear with your Euros and your Dollars. Really the only other option would be to be compensated for services rendered in Euros, but that would have tax implications and the fees of an international tax attorney would probably outstrip any savings from Forex spreads and fees not paid.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can I avoid international wire fees or currency transfer fees?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Buying a mortgaged house,"Based on what you asked and your various comments on other answers, this is the first time that you will be making an offer to buy a house, and it seems that the seller is not using a realestate agent to sell the house, that is, it is what is called a FSBO for sale by owner property and you can learn a lot of about the sellers perspective by visiting fsbo.com. On the other hand, you are a FTB firsttime buyer and I strongly recommend that you find out about the purchase process by Googling for ""firsttime home buyer"" and reading some of the articles there. But most important, I urge you DO NOT make a written offer to purchase the property until you understand a lot more than you currently do, and a lot more than all the answers here are telling you about making an offer to buy this property. Even when you feel absolutely confident that you understand everything, hire a realestate lawyer or a realestate agent to write the actual offer itself the agent might well use a standard purchase offer form that his company uses, or the State mandates, and just fill in the blanks. Yes, you will need to pay a fee to these people but it is very important for your own protection, and so dont just wing it when making an offer to purchase. As to how much you should offer, it depends on how much you can afford to pay. I will ignore the possibility that you are rich enough that you can pay cash for the purchase and assume that you will, like most people, be needing to get a mortgage loan to buy the house. Most banks prefer not to lend more than 80 of the appraised value of the house, with the balance of the purchase price coming from your personal funds. They will in some cases, loan more than 80 but will usually charge higher interest rate on the loan, require you to pay mortgage insurance, etc. Now, the appraised value is not determined until the bank sends its own appraiser to look at the property, and this does not happen until your bid has been accepted by the seller. What if your bid say 500K is much larger than the appraised value 400K on which the bank is willing to lend you only 320K ? Well, you can still proceed with the deal if you have 180K available to make the pay the rest. Or, you can let the deal fall apart if you have made a properly written offer that contains the usual contingency clause that you will be applying for a mortgage of 400K at rate not to exceed x and that if you cant get a mortgage commitment within y days, the deal is off. Absent such a clause, you will lose the earnest money that you put into escrow for failure to follow through with the contract to purchase for 500K. Making an offer in the same ballpark as the market value lessens the chances of having the deal fall through. Note also that even if the appraised value is 500K, the bank might refuse to lend you 400K if your loan application and credit report suggest that you will have difficulty making the payments on a 400K mortgage. It is a good idea to get a preapproval from a lender saying that based on the financial information that you have provided, you will likely be approved for a mortgage of Z that is, the bank thinks that you can afford the payments on a mortgage of as much as Z. That way, you have some feel for how much house you can afford, and that should affect what kinds of property you should be bidding on.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Buying a mortgaged house?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does endofyear interact with mutual fund prices if it does?,"This answer is applicable to the US. Similar rules may hold in some other countries as well. The shares in an openended nonexchangetraded mutual fund are not traded on stock exchanges and the ""market"" does not determine the share price the way it does for shares in companies as brokers make offers to buy and sell stock shares. The price of one share of the mutual fund usually called Net Asset Value NAV per share is usually calculated at the close of business, and is, as the name implies, the net worth of all the shares in companies that the fund owns plus cash on hand etc divided by the number of mutual fund shares outstanding. The NAV per share of a mutual fund might or might not increase in anticipation of the distribution to occur, but the NAV per share very definitely falls on the day that the distribution is declared. If you choose to reinvest your distribution in the same fund, then you will own more shares at a lower NAV per share but the total value of your investment will not change at all. If you had 100 shares currently priced at 10 and the fund declares a distribution of 2 per share, you will be reinvesting 200 to buy more shares but the fund will be selling you additional shares at 8 per share and of course, the 100 shares you hold will be priced at 8 per share too. So, you will have 100 previous shares worth only 800 now  25 new shares worth 200 for a total of 125 shares at 8  1000 total investment, just as before. If you take the distribution in cash, then you still hold the 100 shares but they are worth only 800 now, and the fund will send you the 200 as cash. Either way, there is no change in your net worth. However, assuming that the fund is is not in a taxadvantaged account, that 200 is taxable income to you regardless of whether you reinvest it or take it as cash. The fund will tell you what part of that 200 is dividend income as well as what part is Qualified Dividend income, what part is shortterm capital gains, and what part is longterm capital gains you declare the income in the appropriate categories on your tax return, and are taxed accordingly. So, what advantage is there in reinvesting? Well, your basis in those shares has increased and so if and when you sell the shares, you will owe less tax. If you had bought the original 100 shares at 10 and sell the 125 shares a few years later at 11 and collect 1375, you owe longterm capital gains tax on just 13751200 175 which can also be calculated as 1 gain on each of the original 100 shares  100 plus 3 gain on the 25 new shares  175. In the past, some people would forget the intermediate transactions and think that they had invested 1000 initially and gotten 1375 back for a gain of 375 and pay taxes on 375 instead. This is less likely to occur now since mutual funds are now required to report more information on the sale to the shareseller than they used to in the past. So, should you buy shares in a mutual fund right now? Most mutual fund companies publish preliminary estimates in November and December of what distributions each fund will be making by the end of the year. They also usually advise against purchasing new shares during this period because one ends up ""buying a dividend"". If, for example, you bought those 100 shares at 10 on the Friday after Thanksgiving and the fund distributes that 2 per share on December 15, you still have 1000 on December 15, but now owe taxes on 200 that you would not have had to pay if you had postponed buying those shares till after the distribution was paid. Nitpickers for simplicity of exposition, I have not gone into the detailed chronology of when the fund goes exdividend, when the distribution is recorded, and when cash is paid out, etc., but merely treated all these events as happening simultaneously.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does endofyear interact with mutual fund prices if it does?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

That left an extra month that had to be accounted for in the schedule somewhere.

Why does the stock market index get affected when a terrorist attack takes place?,"There are more than a few different ways to consider why someone may have a transaction in the stock market Employee stock options  If part of my compensation comes from having options that vest over time, I may well sell shares at various points because I dont want so much of my new worth tied up in one company stock. Thus, some transactions may happen from people cashing out stock options. Shorting stocks  This is where one would sell borrowed stock that then gets replaced later. Thus, one could reverse the traditional buy and sell order in which case the buy is done to close the position rather than open one. Convertible debt  Some companies may have debt that come with warrants or options that allow the holder to acquire shares at a specific price. This would be similar to 1 in some ways though the holder may be a mutual fund or company in some cases. There is also some people that may seek highyield stocks and want an income stream from the stock while others may just want capital appreciation and like stocks that may not pay dividendsBerkshire Hathaway being the classic example here. Others may be traders believing the stock will move one way or another in the shortterm and want to profit from that. So, thus the stock market isnt necessarily as simple as you state initially. A terrorist attack may impact stocks in a couple ways to consider Liquidity  In the case of the attacks of 911, the stock market was closed for a number of days which meant people couldnt trade to convert shares to cash or cash to shares. Thus, some people may pull out of the market out of fear of their money being ""locked up"" when they need to access it. If someone is retired and expects to get xquarter from their stocks and it appears that that may be in jeopardy, it could cause one to shift their asset allocation. Future profits  Some companies may have costs to rebuild offices and other losses that could put a temporary dent in profits. If there is a company that makes widgets and the factory is attacked, the company may have to stop making widgets for a while which would impact earnings, no? There can also be the perception that an attack is ""just the beginning"" and one could extrapolate out more attacks that may affect broader areas.

There is no need to build a credit history. I just got a mortgage on a new house without any real credit history. I have one credit card which I only use on vacations because some countries dont take my debit card, and I always put money on it before I use it, so Ive technically never borrowed money from a bank at all. My banker looked at my SCHUFA with me and we saw that there was nothing in there except for the credit card, which has a 500 limit and if I maxed it out, the monthly interest would be 6,80 so he added that 6,80 to my expenses calculation and that was it. If youre having trouble getting a loan and you dont know why, you can ask the SCHUFA for the data they have on you and you can correct any mistakes they might have made. Sometimes, especially when you have the same full name and birth date as somebody else, the SCHUFA does get things mixed up and you have to sort it out.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Credit rating in Germany?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"The U.S. National Debt What is it, where did it come from, and how does it work?","For political reasons, almost all governments including the US spend more money than they get from taxes etc. There are a number of things a government can do to cover the difference Most governments opt for selling bonds. The ""National Debt"" of a country can be thought of as being the sum of all the ""Bonds"" that are still paying interest, and that the Government hasnt Redeemed. It can all go horribly wrong. If the Government gets into a situation where it cannot pay the interest, or it cannot Redeem the Bonds it has promised to, then it may have to break its promise ""Default"" on its payments. This makes the owners of the Bonds unhappy and means potential buyers of future Bond sales are less likely to want to buy the Governments new Bonds  effectively meaning the Government has to promise to pay more interest in the future. Recent examples of this include Argentina and may include Greece soon. The US is in the fortunate position that not many people believe it will Default. Therefore the new Bonds it sells which it does on a regular basis are still in demand, even though its interest payments, and promises to Redeem Bonds are huge.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."

Top down and bottomup approach ,"Top down approach needed when bottomup approach of markets leads to periods of high unemployment Imagine a chart that starts with one point at the top and breaks it down into the details by the time you get to the bottom. People can read this chart either from the top and go down or from the bottom and go up. Wikipedia does have articles on Topdown and bottomup design if you want more detail than I give here. Top down refers to the idea of starting at a high level and then working down to get into the details. For example, in planning a vacation, one could start with what continent to go, then which country, then which cities in that country and so forth. Thus, the idea here would be to start with macroeconomic trends and then create a strategy to fix this as the other way is what created the problem. The idea of taking a subject or system and breaking it down into individual pieces would be another way to state this. Bottom up refers to the idea of starting with the details and then build up to get a general idea. To use the vacation example again, this is starting with the cities and then building up to build the overall itinerary. Within political circles you may here of ""grassroots"" efforts where citizens will form groups to gain influence. This would be an example of bottom up since it is starting with the people. The idea of taking individual components and putting them together to build up something would be another way to state this. The statement is saying that a completely different style of approach will be necessary than the one that created the problem here.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Top down and bottomup approach?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What emergencies could justify a highly liquid emergency fund?,"If you engage in any kind of dangerous activity, the training courses will often state that an accident is not the result of a simple error. Examples of this include SCUBA and motorcycle training. Properly maintained equipment and training will mitigate many emergencies. Recently my dive buddy was 60 down, and ran out of air due to a tank O ring failure. She did not panic, and all of the dive team rallied to get her to the surface without anyone getting hurt, or even coming close to it. Financial tragedies are similar. In some cases, a single event triggers an avalanche of events that leads to tragedy. For example, hard economic times may lead to an employer doing 5 pay cuts across the board. However, they also cut bonuses and other ancillary pay items. This leads to a real cut of 2025 of income. Leading a true cash flow emergency. As such cutbacks are needed, and this might put a strain on an already shaky relationship, this leads to that relationship ending, requiring more cash. Perhaps a car dies in this process or some household item needs repairing. Sure one can borrow money, but this tends to exasperate the avalanche rather than solve it. Having a low debt and a liquid emergency fund stops the avalanche in its tracks. In the case cited above issues would have been solved if the person lived off of 50 of their income rather than the way most people live paychecktopaycheck. Also if there were savings for the car repair then that becomes a pain, but not a true stress. Think of a liquid emergency fund as ""properly maintained equipment"". It allows you to build a financial life on a solid foundation. In my own case, I attempted to live and invest without an emergency fund. It just did not work. I often had to liquidate investments at in opportune times, and could never really hold onto money. With the foundation of an emergency fund, one can build a prosperous life for ones self.

If your student loan is subsidized by the government, theyre not going to let you use it to start a business or go on vacation ... nor are they likely to let you invest it. Even if it is legal and within the terms of the contract, borrowing money to invest is very risky. What if you invest in the stock market, and then the stock market goes down?

How or is it necessary to rebalance a 401k with only one index fund?,"Theres nothing to rebalance, the index fund rebalances itself to continue matching the index. However, you need to understand that such an investment is not diversified and you only invest in a very specific market, and very specific stocks on that market. SP 500 is large 500 different companies, most of the time, but still not as broadly diversified as your retirement investment portfolio should be. You should talk to a financial adviser CFP for example, many companies provide access to these for 401k plan participants. But in any case, Id suggest considering ""target date"" funds  funds that are investing based on your expected retirement year, and become more conservative as you get closer to that year.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

I spend too much money. How can I get on the path to a frugal lifestyle?,"As others have said getting on a written budget before each month starts is the most important part. Also, Im a big fan of cash budgets as well. They arent for everyone and they take a little getting used to, but once you get used to them youll never want to go back. In a cash budget you take whatever you have budgeted for the month for each category and withdraw the amount needed from the bank. These go into an envelope for each category, i.e. food, clothes, entertainment, etc. If a 3 weeks into the month you run out of money in that envelope you are done spending money in that category. For example, if its the food envelope and you run out its time for you to start eating leftovers and whatever youve got in the pantry.

First concrete steps for retirement planning when one partner is resistant,"Id try to gently point out to your husband that what he thinks he wants to do now and what he might want to do in 20 or 30 years are not necessarily the same thing.

Even if your husband is absolutely certain that he will not change his mind about retiring in the next 20 years, maybe something will happen that puts things beyond his control. Like medical problems, or simply getting too old to be able to work. Is he sure that he will be able to continue to put in 40 hour weeks when hes 80? 90? 100?

What are the most efficient ways to bet on an individual stock beating the market?,"tldr Unfortunately, there is little available to the retail investor that fits your description. Institutional investors can use swaps to gain leverage on the above trade. A bank will build a basket of long MSFT and short SPY and then quote a rate against LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate and a margin requirement. So at the end of the swap the bank will pay the difference in total return between MSFT and SPY and the investor will pay some amount of cash back. The nice thing for the investor is that the margin requirement will often be fairly small if their credit is good so the investor can lever the trade up significantly. A retail investor could call up your broker and try to get the above but on the off chance they let you the margin requirement might be higher than just going short the SPY. If you arent a retail investor, you might be able to do something like be long a 3X tech ETF and short 3X SPY ETF. If you are very clever you might be able to combine multiple levered tech ETFs to get something like 3X MSFT. However, I would strongly caution against levered etfs for most retail investors as the fees are high and levered etfs tend to strongly drift away from the index against the investor over anything but the shortest time periods.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are the most efficient ways to bet on an individual stock beating the market?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

I carelessly invested in a stock on a spike near the peak price. How can I salvage my investment?,"You can do several things After the fact If you believe the stock will go up, you can buy more stock now, its whats called ""averaging"". So, you bought 100 at 10, now its at 7. To gain money from your original investment it needs to raise to over 10. But if you really think itll go up, you can buy and average. So you buy, say, 100 more stock at 7, now you have 200 shares at 8.50 average so you gain money on your investment when the stock goes over 8.50 instead of 10. Of course, you risk losing even more money if the stock keeps going down. Before the fact When you buy stock, set triggers. In most trading houses you can set automatic triggers to fire on conditions you set. When you buy 100 shares at 10, you can set a trigger to automatically sell the 100 shares if it drops below 9, so you limit your losses to 10 for example.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: I carelessly invested in a stock on a spike near the peak price.

Is there a good rule of thumb for how much I should have set aside as emergency cash?,"First you should maintain a monthly expense and find out the burn rate. There would be certain expenses that are annual but mandatory [School fees, Insurance Premium, Property Taxes, etc]. So the ideal emergency fund depending on your industry should be 3 month to 6 months plus your mandatory yearly payments, more so if they come together. For example Most of my annual payments come out in May and I bank on the Bonus payout in April to cater to this spike in expense. So if I were to lose a job in March, my emergency funds would be sufficient for routine expenses, if i dont provision for additional funds Second you need to also figure out the reduced rate of monthly burn and ideally the emergency funds should be for 3 months of normal burn and 6 months of reduced burn.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is there a good rule of thumb for how much I should have set aside as emergency cash?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Is investing in an ETF generally your best option after establishing a Roth IRA?,"ETFs are a type of investment, not a specific choice. In other words, there are good ETFs and bad. What you see is the general statement that ETFs are preferable to most mutual funds, if only for the fact that they are low cost. An index ETF such as SPY which reflects the SP 500 index has a .09 annual expense, vs a mutual fund which average a full percent or more. sheegaon isnt wrong, I just have a different spin to offer you. Given a long term return of say even 8 note  this question is not a debate of the long term return, and I purposely chose a low number compared to the long term average, closer to 10 and the current CD rate of 1, a 1 hit for the commission on the buy side doesnt bother me. The sell wont occur for a long time, and 8 on a 10K sale is no big deal. Id not expect you to save 1Kyr in cashCDs for the years it would take to make that 8 fee look tiny. Not when over time the growth will overshaddow this. One day you will be in a position where the swings in the market will produce the random increase or decrease to your net worth in the 10s of thousands. Do you know why you wont lose a nights sleep over this? Because when you invested your first 1K, and started to pay attention to the market, you saw how some days had swings of 3 or 4, and you built up an immunity to the day to day noise. You stayed invested and as you gained wealth, you stuck to the right rebalancing each year, so a market crash which took others down by 30, only impacted you by 1520, and you were ready for the next move to the upside. And you also saw that since mutual funds with their 1 fees never beat the index over time, you were happy to say you lagged the SP by .09, or 1 over 11 years time vs those whose funds had some great years, but lost it all in the bad years. And by the way, right until you are in the 25 bracket, Roth is the way to go. When you are at 25, thats the time to use pretax accounts to get just below the cuttoff. Last, welcome to SE. Edit  see sheegaons answer below. I agree, I missed the cost of the bidask spread. Going with the lowest cost index funds may make better sense for you. To clarify, Sheehan points out that ETFs trade like a stock, a commission, and a bidask, both add to transaction cost. So, agreeing this is the case, an indexedbased mutual fund can provide the best of possible options.

How do you calculate the rate of return ROR when buying and selling put options?,"What Jaydles said. I think of each strategy in terms of Capital at Risk CaR. Its a good thing to know when considering any position. And then conveniently, the return is always profit  CaR. With covered calls its pretty easy. Pay 1000 for stock, receive 80 in premium, net CaR is 920. If you own the stock and write calls many times that expire worthless, or you that you buy back, there are two measurements to consider. First, treat every covered call as a buywrite. Even if you already own the stock, disregard the real cost basis, and calculate from the moment you write the call, using the stock price at that time. The second measure is more complicated, but involves using something like the XIRR function in a spreadsheet. This tracks the series as a whole, even accounting for times where there is no written call outstanding. For the written put, even though your broker may only require 30 collateral in a margin account, mentally treat them as cashsecured. Strike less premium is your true CaR. If the stock goes to zero by expiration, thats what youre on the hook for. You could just compute based on the 30 collateral required, but in my view that confuses cashcollateral needs with true risk. Note a written put is exactly identical to a covered call at the same strike. If you tend to favor puts over CCs, ask yourself why. Just like a loaded gun, leverage isnt inherently bad, but you sure want to know when youre using it.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How do you calculate the rate of return ROR when buying and selling put options?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Do I make money in the stock market from other people losing money?,"In gambling, the house also takes a cut, so the total money in the game is shrinking by 210 percent. So if you gain 100, its because other people lost 105, and you do this for dozens of plays, so it stacks up. The market owns companies who are trying to create economic value  take nothing and make it something. They usually succeed, and this adds to the total pot and makes all players richer regardless of trades. Gambling is transactional, theres a ""pull"" or a ""roll"" or a ""hand"", and when its over you must do new transactions to continue playing. Investing parks your money indefinitely, you can be 30 years in a stock and thats one transaction. And given the long time, virtually all your gains will be new economic value created, at no one elses expense, i.e. Nobody loses. Now its possible to trade in and out of stocks very rapidly, causing them to be transactional like gambling the extreme example is daytrading. When youre not in a stock long enough for the company to create any value paid in dividends or the market appreciating the value, then yes, for someone to gain, someone else must lose. And the house takes a cut e.g. Etrades 10 trading fee in and out. In that case both players are trying to win, and one just had better info on average. Another case is when the market drops. For instance right after Brexit I dumped half my domestic stocks and bought Euro index funds. I gambled Euro stocks would rebound better than US stocks would continue to perform. Obviously, others were counterbetting that American stocks will still grow more than Euro will rebound. Who won that gamble? Certainly we will all do better longterm, but some of us will do betterer. And thats what its all about.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Do I make money in the stock market from other people losing money?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

If the interest doesnt compound, the principal balance will be about 8888.37 and the weekly payment would be 189.85. Note, however, that the terms of the loan could be completely customized, so youd need to be sure that the payment and the amortization schedule make sense to you before you agree to the loan.

Who gets the periodic payments when an equity is sold on an repurchase agreement?,"Repurchase agreements are a way of financing a security position. You have a collateralized loan where you give your security in exchange for cash. Lets say you have a 10 year Treasury note paying 3.5 while the 1week repurchase rate is 0.5. You loan the security to someone with a promise to repurchase it from them some time in the future. You collect the 3.5 coupon and you pay the 0.5 interest. Clearly it makes no sense for someone to collect interest on money and also collect coupon payments. And for the counterparty it makes no sense to be not getting coupon payments and also to be paying interest. This how one website explains the process During the transaction, any coupon payments that come due belong to the legal owner, the ""borrower."" However, when this happens, a cash amount equal to the coupon is paid to the original owner, this is called ""manufactured payment."" In order to avoid the tax payment on the coupon, some institutions will repo the security to a tax exempt entity and receive the manufactured payment and avoid the tax ""coupon washing"" I find this unequivocal description to be the clearest During the life of the transaction the market risk and the credit risk of the collateral remain with the seller. Because he has agreed to repurchase the asset for an agreed sum of money at maturity. Provided the trade is correctly documented if the collateral has a coupon payment during the life of the repo the buyer is obliged to pay this to the seller.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Who gets the periodic payments when an equity is sold on an repurchase agreement?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Beginning investment,"Your question is very broad. Whole books can and have been written on this topic. The right place to start is for you and your wife to sit down together and figure out your goals. Where do you want to be in 5 years, 25 years, 50 years? To quote Yogi Berra ""If you dont know where you are going, youll end up someplace else."" Lets go backwards. 50 Years Im guessing the answer is ""retired, living comfortably and not having to worry about money"". You say you work an unskilled government job. Does that job have a pension program? How about other retirement savings options? Will the pension be enough or do you need to start putting money into the other retirement savings options? Career wise, do you want to be working as in unskilled government jobs until you retire, or do you want to retire from something else? If so, how do you get there? Your goals here will affect both your 25 year plan and your 5 year plan. Finally, as you plan for death, which will happen eventually. What do you want to leave for your children? Likely the pension will not be transferred to your children, so if you want to leave them something, you need to start planning ahead. 25 Years At this stage in your life, you are likely talking, college for the children and possibly your wife back at work could happen much earlier than this, e.g., when the kids are all in school. What do you want for your children in college? Do you want them to have the opportunity to go without having to take on debt? What savings options are there for your childrens college? Also, likely with all your children out of the house at college, what do you and your wife want to do? Travel? Give to charity? Own your own home? 5 Years You mention having children and your wife staying at home with them. Can your family live on just your income? Can you do that and still achieve your 50 and 25 year goals? If not, further education or training on your part may be needed. Are you in debt? Would you like to be out of debt in the next 510 years? I know Ive raised more questions than answers. This is due mostly to the nature of the question youve asked. It is very personal, and I dont know you. What I find most useful is to look at where I want to be in the near, mid and long term and then start to build a plan for how I get there. If you have older friends or family who are where you want to be when you reach their age, talk to them. Ask them how they got there. Also, there are tons of resources out there to help you.

"If stock price drops by the amount of dividend paid, what is the use of a dividend","Best as i can tell, the simple answer is the smartest approach to investing for dividends is to pick a company that is, has, and will continue to make a solid profits. there are lots of them out there. specifically, companies with no debt, a history of longterm and steady growth and a stable market share will, almost always recoup any drop in stock valuation due to a dividend payout...and usually in short order. this is why dividends were created...as a mechanism for distributing profits back to investor without diminishing thier stake in the company. the trick then, is to find such companies with the best ratio between stock price and dividend payout. and again, there are a lot of good options out there. All the trepidation is justified however, as many unscrupulous companies will try to pull investors in with high dividends as a means to simply generate capital. these companies have few of the quality attributes mentioned above. instead, High debt, fluctuating or negative profits, minimal market share or diminishing growth present a very risky long term play and will be avoided by this conservative investor.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If stock price drops by the amount of dividend paid, what is the use of a dividend?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Assuming we ever see a world of high interest rates, it may not provide a great return. The authors make the assumption that interest rates will be rising in the future, thus the permanent portfolio is riskier than a traditional 6040.

"If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?","Imagine that a company never distributes any of its profits to its shareholders. The company might invest these profits in the business to grow future profits or it might just keep the money in the bank. Either way, the company is growing in value. But how does that help you as a small investor? If the share price never went up then the market value would become tiny compared to the actual value of the company. At some point another company would see this and put a bid in for the whole company. The shareholders wouldnt sell their shares if the bid didnt reflect the true value of the company. This would mean that your shares would suddenly become much more valuable. So, the reason why the share price goes up over time is to represent the perceived value of the company. As this could be realised either by the distribution of dividends or a return of capital to shareholders, or by a bidder buying the whole company, the shares are actually worth something to someone in the market. So the share price will tend to track the value of the company even if dividends are never paid. In the short term a share price reflects sentiment, but over the long term it will tend to track the value of the company as measured by its profitability.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If a stock doesnt pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Whats the difference when asked for debit or credit by a store when using credit and debit cards?,"These are two different ways of processing payments. They go through different systems many times, and are treated differently by the banks, credit card issuers and the stores. Merchants pay different fees on transactions paid by debit cards and by credit cards. Debit transactions require PIN, and are deducted from your bank account directly. In order to achieve that, the transaction has to reach the bank in real time, otherwise it will be declined. This means, that the merchant has to have a line of communications open to the relevant processor, that in turn has to be able to connect to the bank and get the authorization  all that while online. The bank verifies the PIN, authorizes the transaction, and deducts the amount from your account, while youre still at the counter. Many times these transactions cannot be reversed, and the fraud protections and warranties are different from credit transactions. Credit transactions dont have to go to your card issuer at all. The merchant can accept credit payment without calling anyone, and without getting prior authorizations. Even if the merchant sends the transaction for authorization with its processor, if the processor cannot reach the issuing bank  they can still approve the transaction under certain conditions. This is, however, never true with debit cards even if used as ""credit"". Theyre not deducted from your bank account, but accumulated on your credit card account. Theyre posted there when the actual transaction reaches the card issuer, which may be many days and even many months after the transaction took place. Credit transactions can be reversed in some cases very easily, and enjoy from a higher level of fraud protection. In some countries and most, if not all, of the EU fraudulent credit transactions are never the consumers problem, always the banks. Not so with debit transactions.

What exactly is a derivative?,"The basic idea behind a derivative is very simple actually. It is a contract where the final value depends on is derived from the value of something else. Stock, for instance, is not a derivative because the contract itself is actually ownership of part of a company. Whereas car insurance is a derivative because the payout depends on the value of something else namely your and other peoples cars. The problem with such a simple definition is that it covers such a broad class. It covers simple contracts like Futures where the end value just depends on the price of something on a future date. But it extends to contracts complicated enough that people in finance call them Exotics. Derivatives are broadly used for two things reducing risk sometimes called insurance and speculation. A farmer can use derivatives to make sure she gets paid a certain amount for her corn. A banker can group a bunch of loans together and sell slices to reduce the pain of a particular loan failing. At the same time people can use the same instruments to speculate on the price of for example that corn or those loans and the main advantage is that they dont have to buy the corn or loans directly. Any farmer will tell you corn can be very expensive to store. Derivatives generally cause problems both individually and sometimes world wide when people dont properly understand the risks involved. The most famous example being Mortgagebacked Securities and the recent Great Recession. You can start understand the instruments and their risks by this wonderful Wikipedia article and later perhaps a used collection of CFA books which cover derivatives in great detail.

So you end up having imperfect algorithms, not humans, deciding the price of almost every security being traded. These algorithms data mine for news releases or they look for and make correlations, even when none exist. The result is that every asset traded using HFT is mispriced. This happens in a variety of ways. Algos will react to the same news event if it has multiple sources Ive seen stocks soar when week old news was rereleased, algos will react to fake news posted on Twitter, and algos will correlate SP to other indexes such as VIX or currencies.

So currency technically means nothing, because as you mentioned the country could print more any time it wants. Now what makes it useful is the combination of two big things So I would say, we know they owe us 100 ""dollars"", and the dollar is just a word we use to represent value. It is not technically worth anything, beyond the fact that the government controls the amount of that currency in circulation and you trust that people still want more of that currency.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."
Why dont share prices of a company rise every other Friday when the company buys shares for its own employees?,"Many companies actually just issue new shares for employee compensation instead of buying back existing ones. So actually, the share price should go down because the same value is now diluted over more shares. In addition, this would not necessarily affect companies with many employees than those with fewer employees because companies with more employees tend to be bigger and thus have more shares among which the change in demand would be distributed. Also, I think many companies do not issue shares to employees every pay day, but just e.g. once every quarter.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why dont share prices of a company rise every other Friday when the company buys shares for its own employees?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Should I finance a new home theater at 0 even though I have the cash for it?,"I bought a Thinkpad in Dec 2007 using BillMeLater, which was working with IBMLenovo at that time. I was getting the notebook at the lowest price available, from the manufacturer. I had the money to pay for it  around 1400. But I went ahead and took the offer from BillMeLater. It was essentially a 12month zerointerest credit card balance transfer loan. Sketchy bit its very nature. They spammed my inbox with solicitations, which was annoying. But I set my bank to pay the monthly amount or slightly over, since it decreases each month and to make the final payoff  all at the time of purchase. This worked just fine  but I still had spam from BillMeLater for quite a while. I still ran a slight risk that something would go wrong, at which point Id face interest charges  but I would then have paid off the item plus those interest charges. Luckily I avoided that.

How can I live outside of the rat race of American life with 300k?,"The title of your question is quite different then the content.

What extra information might be obtained from the next highest bids in an order book?,"The Level 2 data is simply showing the depth of the market.

With another broker I get the top ten bid and ask prices and how many orders are available for each price level, or I have the option of listing each order separately for each price level in order of when the order was placed. I get the same kind of data if trading options. I do not know about futures because I dont trade them. Simply this data may be important to a trader because it may give an indication of whether there are more buyers or sellers in the market, which in turn may but not always give an indication of which way the market may be moving. As an example the price depth below shows WBC before market open with sellers outweighing the buyers in both numbers and volume. This gives an indication that prices may drop when the market opens. Of course there could be some good news coming out prior to market open or just after, causing a flood of buyers into the market and sellers to cancel their orders. This would change everything around with more buyers than sellers and indicate that prices may now be going up.

Mutual Funds Definition and Role,"I think you are asking about actively managed funds vs. indexes and possibly also vs. diversified funds like target date funds. This is also related to the question of mutual fund vs. ETF. First, a fund can be either actively managed or it can attempt to track an index. An actively managed fund has a fund manager who tries to find the best stocks to invest in within some constraints, like ""this fund invests in large cap US companies"". An index fund tries to match as closely as possible the performance of an index like the SP 500. A fund may also try to offer a portfolio that is suitable for someone to put their entire account into. For example, a target date fund is a fund that may invest in a mix of stocks, bonds and foreign stock in a proportion that would be appropriate to someone expecting to retire in a certain year. These are not what people tend to think of as the canonical examples of mutual funds, even though they share the same legal structure and investment mechanisms. Secondly, a fund can either be a traditional mutual fund or it can be an exchange traded fund ETF. To invest in a traditional mutual fund, you send money to the fund, and they give you a number of shares equal to what that money would have bought of the net asset value NAV of the fund at the end of trading on the day they receive your deposit, possibly minus a sales charge. To invest in an ETF, you buy shares of the ETF on the stock market like any other stock. Under the covers, an ETF does have something similar to the mechanism of depositing money to get shares, but only big traders can use that, and its not used for investing, but only for people who are making a market in the stock if lots of people are buying VTI, Big Dealer Co will get 100,000 shares from Vanguard so that they can sell them on the market the next day. Historically and traditionally, ETFs are associated with an indexing strategy, while if not specifically mentioned, people assume that traditional mutual funds are actively managed. Many ETFs, notably all the Vanguard ETFs, are actually just a different way to hold the same underlying fund. The best way to understand this is to read the prospectus for a mutual fund and an ETF.

Retirement Funds Betterment vs Vanguard Life strategy vs Target Retirement,"First, congratulations on choosing to invest in low cost passively managed plans. If you choose any one of these options and stick with it, you will already be well ahead of most individual investors. Almost all plans will allow you to rebalance between asset classes. With some companies, sales agents will encourage you to sell your overweighted assets and buy underweighted assets as this generates brokerage commissions for them, but when you only need to make minor adjustments, you can simply change the allocation of the new money going into your account until you are back to your target weights. Most plans will let you do this for free, and in general, you will only need to do this every few years at most. I dont see much reason for you to be in the Target funds. The main feature of these plans is that they gradually shift you to a more conservative asset allocation over time, and are designed to prevent people who are close to retirement from being too aggressive and risking a major loss just before retirement. Its very likely that at your age, most plans will have very similar recommendations for your allocation, with equities at 80 or more, and this is unlikely to change for the next few decades. The main benefits of betterment seems to be simplicity and ease of use, but there is one concern I would have for you with betterment. Precisely because it is so easy to tweak your allocation, Im concerned that you might hurt your longterm results by reacting to shortterm market conditions I know I said I wanted a hands off account, but what if the stock market crashes and I want to allocate more to bonds??? One of the biggest reasons that stock returns are better than bond returns on average is that you are being paid to accept additional risk, and living with significant ups and downs is part of what it means to be in the stock market. If you are tempted to take money out of an asset class when it has been ""losingfeels dangerous"" and put more in when it is ""winningfeels safe"", my concerns is that you will end up buying high and selling low. Id recommend taking a look at this article on the emotional cycle of investing. My point is simply that its very likely that if you are moving money in and out of stocks based on volatility, youre much less likely to get the full market return over the long term, and might be better off putting more weight in asset classes with lower volatility. Either way, Id recommend taking one or more risk tolerance assessments online and making sure youre committed to sticking with a longterm plan that doesnt involve more risk than you can really live with. I tend to lean toward Vanguard Life Strategy simply because Vanguard as a company has been around longer, but betterment does seem very accessible to a new investor.

ProsCons of Buying Discounted Company Stock,"Is this an employee stock purchase plan ESPP? If so, and there is no required holding period, selling right away is essentially a guaranteed bonus with minimal risk. One caveat is that sometimes it takes a while to actually receive the shares at your brokerage, and in the meantime your company may have an earnings report that could cause the share price to drop. If your discount is only 5, for example, a bad earnings report could easily wipe that out. The only other cons I can think of is ESPP contributions being withheld from you for months albeit for a virtually guaranteed return, and it complicates your taxes a bit. On the flip side, another pro is that after you sell the shares, you are more likely to invest that money rather than spend it.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: ProsCons of Buying Discounted Company Stock?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Where does the stock go in a collapse?,"Just before a crash or at the start of the crash most of the smart money would have gotten out, the remaining technical traders would be out by the time the market has dropped 10 to 15, and some of them would be shorting their positions by now. Most longterm buy and hold investors would stick to their guns and stay in for the long haul. Some will start to get nervous and have sleepless nights when the markets have fallen 30 and look to get out as well. Others stay in until they cannot stand it anymore. And some will stick it out throughout the downturn. So who are the buyers at this stage? Some are the so called bargain hunters that buy when the market has fallen over 30 only to sell again when it falls another 20, or maybe buy more because they think they are dollar cost averaging and will make a packet when the price goes back up  if and when it does. Some are those with stops covering their short positions, whilst others may be fund managers and individuals looking to rebalance their portfolios. What you have to remember during both an uptrend and a downtrend the price does not move straight up or straight down. If we take the downtrend for instance, it will have lower lows and lower highs that is the definition of a downtrend. See the chart below of the SP 500 during the GFC falls. As you can see just before it really started falling in Jan 08 there was ample opportunity for the smart money and the technical traders to get out of the market as the price drops below the 200 MA and it fails to make a higher peak. As the price falls from Jan 08 to Mar 08 you suddenly start getting some movement upwards. This is the bargain hunters who come into the market thinking the price is a bargain compared to 3 months ago, so they start buying and pushing the price up somewhat for a couple of months before it starts falling again. The reason it falls again is because the people who wanted to sell at the start of the year missed the boat, so are taking the opportunity to sell now that the prices have increased a bit. So you get this battle between the buyers bulls and seller bears, and of course the bears are winning during this downtrend. That is why you see more sharper falls between Aug to Oct 08, and it continues until the lows of Mar 09. In short it has got to do with the phycology of the markets and how peoples emotions can make them buy andor sell at the wrong times.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Where does the stock go in a collapse?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What are the economic benefits of owning a home in the United States?,"Alex B already answered the first question. I want to respond to the second and third I have heard the term ""The equity on your home is like a bank"". What does that mean? I suppose I could borrow using the equity in my home as collateral? Yes, you can borrow against the equity in your home. What you should keep in mind is that you can only borrow against the amount that youve paid on your house. For example, if youve paid 100,000 against your house, you can then borrow 100,000 assuming the value hasnt changed. The argument that this is a good deal misses the obvious alternative If you didnt spend that 100,000 on a house, then youd still have it and wouldnt need to take out a loan at all. Of course, equity still has value, and you should consider it when doing the costbenefit analysis, but make sure to compare your equity to savings you could have from renting. Are there any other general benefits that would drive me from paying 800 in rent, to owning a house? Economically As youll notice from my parenthetical remarks, this is extremely situational. It might be good to come up with a spreadsheet for your situation, taking all of the costs into account, and see if you end up better or worse.

"What is the best asset allocation for a retirement portfolio, and why?","Its all about risk. These guidelines were all developed based on the risk characteristics of the various asset categories. Bonds are ultralowrisk, large caps are lowrisk you dont see most big stocks like CocaCola going anywhere soon, foreign stocks are mediumrisk subject to additional political risk and currency risk, especially so in developing markets and smallcaps are higher risk more to gain, but more likely to go out of business. Moreover, the risks of different asset classes tend to balance each other out some. When stocks fall, bonds typically rise the recent credit crunch being a notable but temporary exception as people flock to safety or as the Fed adjusts interest rates. When stocks soar, bonds dont look as attractive, and interest rates may rise a bummer when you already own the bonds.

How to realize capital gains before going from nonresident alien to resident alien in USA,"This will work as intended, but theres another point to consider. In the US, the tax rate on proceeds from stock sales is higher for short term holdings, which are defined as held for less than one year. Both rates vary based on your income. Bracket numbers are for fiscal year 2014, filing as single. The difference between short and long term capital gains tax in the US is a minimum of ten percentage points, and works out to 15 percentage points on average. This is substantial. If you wont be reporting much income the year you move to the US say because you only worked for a portion of the year it is decidedly to your advantage to wait and sell the stocks in the US, to get that sweet 0 rate.

What effect does a companys earnings have on the price of its stock?,"Your autograph analogy seems relevant to me. But it is not just speculation.

Now in theory the price of any financial instrument is equal to the net present value today of all the future cash flows from the instrument. So if companys earnings improve, shareholders hope that the earnings will trickle down to them either in form of dividends or in form of capital gain. So they buy the stock, creating demand for it.

How to evaluate stocks? e.g. Whether some stock is cheap or expensive?,"If you are looking for numerical metrics I think the following are popular PriceEarnings PE  You mentioned this very popular one in your question. There are different PE ratios  forward essentially an estimate of future earnings by management, trailing, etc.. I think of the PE as a quick way to grade a companys income statement i.e How much does the stock cost verusus the amount of earnings being generated on a per share basis?. Some caution must be taken when looking at the PE ratio. Earnings can be ""massaged"" by the company. Revenue can be moved between quarters, assets can be depreciated at different rates, residual value of assets can be adjusted, etc.. Knowing this, the PE ratio alone doesnt help me determine whether or not a stock is cheap. In general, I think an affordable stock is one whose PE is under 15. PriceBook  I look at the PriceBook as a quick way to grade a companys balance sheet. The book value of a company is the amount of cash that would be left if everything the company owned was sold and all debts paid i.e. the companys net worth. The cash is then divided amoung the outstanding shares and the PriceBook can be computed. If a company had a pricebook under 1.0 then theoretically you could purchase the stock, the company could be liquidated, and you would end up with more money then what you paid for the stock. This ratio attempts to answer ""How much does the stock cost based on the net worth of the company?"" Again, this ratio can be ""massaged"" by the company. Asset values have to be estimated based on current market values think about trying to determine how much a companys building is worth unless, of course, marktomarket is suspended. This involves some estimating. Again, I dont use this value alone in determing whether or not a stock is cheap. I consider a pricebook value under 10 a good number. Cash  I look at growth in the cash balance of a company as a way to grade a companys cash flow statement. Is the cash account growing or not? As they say, ""Cash is King"". This is one measurement that can not be ""massaged"" which is why I like it. The PE and PriceBook can be ""tuned"" but in the end the company cannot hide a shrinking cash balance. Return Ratios  Return on Equity is a measure of the amount of earnings being generated for a given amount of equity ROE  earningsassets  liabilities. This attempts to measure how effective the company is at generating earnings with a given amount of equity. There is also Return on Assets which measures earnings returns based on the companys assets. I tend to think an ROE over 15 is a good number. These measurements rely on a company accurately reporting its financial condition. Remember, in the US companies are allowed to falsify accounting reports if approved by the government so be careful. There are others who simply dont follow the rules and report whatever numbers they like without penalty. There are many others. These are just a few of the more popular ones.

What are pros and cons of volatility trading over directional stock trading,"Cant totally agree with that. Volatility trading is just one trading type of many. In my opinion it doesnt depend on whether you are a professional trader or not. As you might have heard, retail traders are said to create noise on the market, mainly due to the fact that they arent professional in their majority. So, I would assume, if an average retail trader decided to trade volatility he would create as much noise as if would have been betting on stock directions. Basically, most types of trading would require a considerable amount of effort spent on fundamental analysis of the underlying be it volatility or directional trading. Arbitrage trading would be an exception here, I guess. However, volatility trading relies more on traders subjective expectations about future deviations, whereas trading stock directions requires deeper research of the underlying. Is it a drawback or an advantage? I.d.k. On the other handside volatility trading strategies cover both upward and downward movements, but you can set similar hedging strategies when going short or long on stocks, isnt it?

Are stocks always able to be bought and sold at market price?,"As others have noted, your definition of ""market price"" is a bit loose. Really whatever price you get becomes the current market price. What you usually get quoted are the current best bid and ask with the last transaction price. For stocks that dont trade much, the last transaction price may not be representative of the current market value. Your question included regulation ""standards bureau"", and I dont think the current answers are addressing that. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC provides some regulation regarding execution price. It goes by the designation Regulation NMS, and, very roughly, it says that each transaction has to take the best available price at the time that it is executed. There are some subtleties, but thats the gist of it. No regulation ensures that there will be a counterparty to any transaction that you want to make. It could happen, for example, that you have shares of some company that youre never able to sell because no one wants them. BitCoin is the same in this regard. There is a currently a market for BitCoin, but theres no regulation that ensures there will be a market for it tomorrow.

Advice for college student Should I hire a financial adviser or just invest in index funds?,"Two things to consider When it comes to advice, dont be ""Penny wise and Pound foolish"". It is an ongoing debate whether active management vs passive indexes are a better choice, and I am sure others can give good arguments for both sides. I look at it as you are paying for advice. If your adviser will teach you about investing and serve your interests, having his advise will probably prevent you from making some dumb mistakes. A few mistakes such as jumping inout of markets based on fearspeculation can eliminate any savings in fees. However, if you feel confident that you have the resources and can make good decisions, why pay for advise you dont need? EDIT In this case, my opinion is that you dont need a complex plan at this time. The money you would spend on financial advise would not be the best use of the funds. That said, to your main question, I would delay making any longterm decisions with these funds until you know you are done with your education and on an established career path. This period of your life can be very volatile, and you may find yourself halfway through college and wanting to change majors or start a different path. Give yourself the option to do that by deferring longterm investment decisions until you have more stability. For that reason, I would avoid focusing on retirement savings. As others point out, you are limited in how much you can contribute per year. If you want to start, ROTH is your best bet, but if you put it in dont pull it out. That is a bad habit to get into. Personal finance is as much about developing habits as it is doing math...

valuing options,"Below I will try to explain two most common Binomial Option Pricing Models BOPM used. First of all, BOPM splits time to expiry into N equal subperiods and assumes that in each period the underlying security price may rise or fall by a known proportion, so the value of an option in any subperiod is a function of its possible values in the following sub period. Therefore the current value of an option is found by working backwards from expiry date through subperiods to current time. There is not enough information in the question from your textbook so we may assume that what you are asked to do is to find a value of a call option using just a Single Period BOPM. Here are two ways of doing this First of all lets summarize your information Current Share Price Vs  70 Strike or exercise price X  60 Riskfree rate r  5.5 or 0.055 Time to maturity t  12 months Downward movement in share price for the period d  65  70  0.928571429 Upward movement in share price for the period u  1d  10.928571429  1.076923077 ""u"" can be translated to  multiplying by Vs  1.076923077  70  75.38 which is the maximum probable share price in 12 months time. If you need more clarification here  the minimum and maximum future share prices are calculated from stocks past volatility which is a measure of risk. But because your textbook question does not seem to be asking this  you probably dont have to bother too much about it yet. Intrinsic Value Just in case someone reading this is unclear  the Value of an option on maturity is the difference between the exercise strike price and the value of a share at the time of the option maturity. This is also called an intrinsic value. Note that American Option can be exercised prior to its maturity in this case the intrinsic value it simply the diference between strike price and the underlying share price at the time of an exercise. But the Value of an option at period 0 also called option price is a price you would normally pay in order to buy it. So, say, with a strike of 60 and Share Price of 70 the intrinsic value is 10, whereas if Share Price was 50 the intrinsic value would be 0. The option price or the value of a call option in both cases would be fixed. So we also need to find intrinsic option values when price falls to the lowest probable and rises to the maximum probable Vcd and Vcu respectively Vcd  6560  5 remember if Strike was 70 then Vcd would be 0 because nobody would exercise an option that is out of the money Vcu  75.3860  15.38 1. Setting up a hedge ratio h  VsudVcuVcd h  701.0769230770.92857142915.385  1 That means we have to write sell 1 option for each share purchased in order to hedge the risks. You can make a simple calculation to check this, but Im not going to go into too much detail here as the equestion is not about hedging. Because this position is riskfree in equilibrium it should pay a riskfree rate 5.5. Then, the formula to price an option Vc using the hedging approach is VshVcertVsuhVcu Where Vc is the value of the call option, h is the hedge ratio, Vs  Current Share Price, Vsu  highest probable share price, r  riskfree rate, t  time in years, Vcu  value of a call option on maturity at the highest probable share price. Therefore solving for Vc 701Vce0.0551212  75.38115.38  70Vc1.056540615  60  70Vc  601.056540615  Vc  70  601.056540615 Which is similar to the formula given in your textbook, so I must assume that using 1r would be simply a very close approximation of the formula above. Then it is easy to find that Vc  13.2108911402  13.21 2. Riskneutral valuation Another way to calculate Vc is using a riskneutral approach. We first introduce a variable p which is a riskneutral probability of an increase in share price. p  ertdud so in your case p  1.0565406150.9285714291.0769230770.928571429  0.862607107 Therefore using p the Vc would be equal Vc  [pVcu1pVcd]ert  Vc  [0.86260710715.380.1373928935]1.056540615  Vc  13.2071229185  13.21 As you can see it is very close to the hedging approach.

So as long as the company is doing well and expected to do well in future its price keeps on increasing as there is someone who want to buy. Why would someone want to sell and not hold one 1. Needs cash for buying house or other purposes, close to retirement etc 2. Is balancing the portfolio to make is less risk based 3.

Is housing provided by a university as employer reported on 1040?,"You should ask a CPA or tax lawyer to what extent living in specific housing provided by the employer as a job requirement is exempt from taxation. You might find a nice surprise. Your tax professional can also help you to report the items properly if misreported. Much of this is in the article you cite in the question, but perhaps a look at some of the original sources is warranted and will show why some expert advice might be useful. I would argue that an RA who is required to police and counsel undergrads in a college dorm in exchange for a room or a flat is closer to a worker with quarters on a ship or at an oil well than a full professor who receives a rental home in a neighborhood near the university as a benefit. In the first case living at the provided premises is necessary to do the job, but in the second case it is merely a benefit of the job. The IRS Publication 15B guidance on employer provided housing is not entirely clear, so you might want to get some additional advice Lodging on Your Business Premises You can exclude the value of lodging you furnish to an employee from the employees wages if it meets the following tests. It is furnished on your business premises. It is furnished for your convenience. The employee must accept it as a condition of employment. Different tests may apply to lodging furnished by educational institutions. See section 119d of the Internal Revenue Code for details. If you allow your employee to choose to receive additional pay instead of lodging, then the lodging, if chosen, isnt excluded. The exclusion also doesnt apply to cash allowances for lodging. On your business premises. For this exclusion, your business premises is generally your employees place of work. For example, if youre a household employer, then lodging furnished in your home to a household employee would be considered lodging furnished on your business premises. For special rules that apply to lodging furnished in a camp located in a foreign country, see section 119c of the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations. For your convenience. Whether or not you furnish lodging for your convenience as an employer depends on all the facts and circumstances. You furnish the lodging to your employee for your convenience if you do this for a substantial business reason other than to provide the employee with additional pay. This is true even if a law or an employment contract provides that the lodging is furnished as pay. However, a written statement that the lodging is furnished for your convenience isnt sufficient. Condition of employment. Lodging meets this test if you require your employees to accept the lodging because they need to live on your business premises to be able to properly perform their duties. Examples include employees who must be available at all times and employees who couldnt perform their required duties without being furnished the lodging. It doesnt matter whether you must furnish the lodging as pay under the terms of an employment contract or a law fixing the terms of employment. Example of qualifying lodging. You employ Sam at a construction project at a remote job site in Alaska. Due to the inaccessibility of facilities for the employees who are working at the job site to obtain lodging and the prevailing weather conditions, you furnish lodging to your employees at the construction site in order to carry on the construction project. You require that your employees accept the lodging as a condition of their employment. You may exclude the lodging that you provide from Sams wages. Additionally, since sufficient eating facilities arent available near your place of employment, you may also exclude meals you provide to Sam from his wages, as discussed under Meals on Your Business Premises , later in this section. Example of nonqualifying lodging. A hospital gives Joan, an employee of the hospital, the choice of living at the hospital free of charge or living elsewhere and receiving a cash allowance in addition to her regular salary. If Joan chooses to live at the hospital, the hospital cant exclude the value of the lodging from her wages because she isnt required to live at the hospital to properly perform the duties of her employment. One question would be how the conflict with IRC 119d is resolved for someone who must live in the dorm to watch over the dorm and its undergrads. Heres 26USC119d from LII d Lodging furnished by certain educational institutions to employees 1 In general In the case of an employee of an educational institution, gross income shall not include the value of qualified campus lodging furnished to such employee during the taxable year. 2 Exception in cases of inadequate rent Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the extent of the excess of A the lesser of i 5 percent of the appraised value of the qualified campus lodging, or ii the average of the rentals paid by individuals other than employees or students of the educational institution during such calendar year for lodging provided by the educational institution which is comparable to the qualified campus lodging provided to the employee, over B the rent paid by the employee for the qualified campus lodging during such calendar year. The appraised value under subparagraph Ai shall be determined as of the close of the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, or, in the case of a rental period not greater than 1 year, at any time during the calendar year in which such period begins. 3 Qualified campus lodging For purposes of this subsection, the term qualified campus lodging means lodging to which subsection a does not apply and which is A located on, or in the proximity of, a campus of the educational institution, and B furnished to the employee, his spouse, and any of his dependents by or on behalf of such institution for use as a residence. 4 Educational institution, etc. For purposes of this subsection A In generalThe term educational institution means i an institution described in section 170b1Aii or an entity organized under State law and composed of public institutions so described, or ii an academic health center.

Recent college grad. Down payment on a house or car?,"Not long after college in my new job I bought a used car with payments, I have never done that since. I just dont like having a car payment. I have bought every car since then with cash. You should never borrow money to buy a car There are several things that come into play when buying a car. When you are shopping with cash you tend to be more conservative with your purchases look at this Study on Credit card purchases. A Dunn  Bradstreet study found that people spend 1218 more when using credit cards than when using cash. And McDonalds found that the average transaction rose from 4.50 to 7.00 when customers used plastic instead of cash. I would bet you if you had 27,000 dollars cash in your hand you wouldnt buy that car. Youd find a better deal, and or a cheaper car. When you finance it, it just doesnt seem to hurt as bad. Even though its worse because now you are paying interest. A new car is just insanity unless you have a high net worth, at least seven figures. Your 27,000 car in 5 years will be worth about 6500. Thats like striking a match to 340 dollars a month, you cant afford to lose that much money. Pay Cash If you lose your job, get hurt, or any number of things that can cost you money or reduce your income, its no problem with a paid for car. They dont repo paid for cars. You have so much more flexibility when you dont have payments. You mention you have 10k in cash, and a 2000 a month positive cash flow. I would find a deal on a 8000  9000 car I would not buy from a dealer. Sell the car you have put that money with the positive cash flow and every other dime you can get at your student loans and any other debt you have, keep renting cheap keep the college lifestyle broke until you are completely out of debt. Then I would save for a house. Finally I would read this Dave Ramsey book, if I would have read this at your age, I would literally be a millionaire by now, Im 37. Dont buy from a dealer Find a private sale car that you can get a deal on, pay less than Kelly Blue Book. Pay a little money 50  75 to have an automotive technician to check it out for you and get a car fax, to make sure there are no major problems.

Why do people take out life insurance on their children? Should I take out a policy on my child?,"Sales tactics for permanent insurance policies can get pretty sleazy. Sending home a flier from school is a way for an insurance salesperson to get hisher message out to 800 families without any effort at all, and very little advertising cost just a ream of paper and some toner. The biggest catchphrases used are the ""just pennies per day"" and ""in case they get some devastating medical condition and become uninsurable."" Sure, both are technically true, but are definitely used to trigger the grown ups insecurities. Having said that and having been in the financial business for a time, which included selling insurance policies, there is a place for insurance of children. A small amount can be used to offset the loss of income for the parents who may have to take extended time away from work to deal with the event of the loss of their child, and to deal with the costs of funeral and burial. Lets face it, the percentage of families who have a sufficiently large emergency fund is extremely small compared to the overall population. Personally, I have added a child rider to my own term insurance policies that covers anyall of my children. It does add some cost to my premiums, but its a small cost on top of something that is already justifiably in place for myself. One other thing to be aware of if youre in a group policy any life insurance where youre automatically accepted without any underwriting process, like through a benefit at work, or some other club or association, the healthy members are subsidizing the unhealthy ones. If youre on the healthy side, you might consider foregoing that policy in favor of getting your own policy through an insurance company of your choice.

What is market capitalization? [duplicate],"Market Capitalization is the equity value of a company. It measures the total value of the shares available for trade in public markets if they were immediately sold at the last traded market price. Some people think it is a measure of a companys net worth, but it can be a misleading for a number of reasons. Share price will be biased toward recent earnings and the Earnings Per Share EPS metric. The most recent market price only reflects the lowest price one market participant is willing to sell for and the highest price another market participant is willing to buy for, though in a liquid market it does generally reflect the current consensus. In an imperfect market for example with a large institutional purchase or sale prices can diverge widely from the consensus price and when multiplied by outstanding shares, can show a very distorted market capitalization. It is also a misleading number when comparing two companies market capitalization because while some companies raise the money they need by selling shares on the markets, others might prefer debt financing from private lenders or sell bonds on the market, or some other capital structure. Some companies sell preferred shares or nonvoting shares along with the traditional shares that exist. All of these factors have to be considered when valuing a company.

Will prices really be different for cash and cards?,"I think the question relates to the discussion here httpclarkhoward.comlivewebshownotes2010100519449 It was always the case that merchants could discount purchases made with cash. What wasnt allowed is allowing the merchant to charge extra for credit card transactions presumably to cover the fees the merchants pay. These fees usually carry a flat fee per transaction, plus around 2 of the purchase price. What also wasnt allowed was them to refuse any credit transactions. People could charge a pack of gum, even if the fees put that transaction in the red. Whats allowed according to this new development is different levels of discounting for different credit cards. Somewhat related to this discussion is another development that happened this summer merchants now have the ability to refuse credit card transactions of less than 10. Heres my feeling on all of this. I think well see merchants imposing minimum credit transaction amounts before we see them monkeying at the 12 level on pricing for different types of credit cards. My feeling is that theyd be wise not to change anything, even though they can.

Is it true that the price of diamonds is based on a monopoly?,"diamonds are intrinsically worthless this is simply wrong. 1 Diamonds that are sold for anything less than, oh, lets say 5000 at original retail  are indeed utterly, totally, completely worthless. It is simply ""one of the great scams"". Their real ""price"" is maybe ""five bucks"". End of story. There is no secondary market. Literally  ""end of story"". If you buy a ""diamond"" lol for ""2000"" to impress your loved one, you can not then ""sell it"" for any amount of money. It is worthless. Once again simple, undeniable fact. the diamond you bought for 2 grand cannot be resold. Irs worthless. OK, maybe you can get 100 bucks for it, something like that. Or, you can scam someone clueless, and get 200 bucks. 2 However actual ""investment"" stones do in fact have a value  if somewhat fragile. Example, a few years ago I sold a stone for 30 thousand. That was a ""real"" price and it was quite liquid  I was within days able to find a buyer. A dealer  he would have then sold it on for 35 or whatever. I have never dealt in stones over six figures, but Im fairly certain those are ""real"" valuable objects just like paintings by name artists. However yes, the line between ""laughable diamonds"" and actual investment stones, is indeed moving ever upwards. Note  the ""elephant in the room"" with diamonds is that GEs industrial process for simply making utterly flawless diamonds, starting with carbon, is getting better every decade. A second overwheleming point that nobody has mentioned diamonds get beatup. Regarding ""engagement ring diamonds"", a used one is exactly as useless as a used car. Its crap. Just as with 200,000 picassos, this concept does not apply to ""actual investment stones"". Note that many of the commentsarguments on this page are very confused because people are not distinguishing between the ROFL ""engagement ring scam market"" and the rarefied ""investment gem market"". The two things are utterly different. Yes, ""engagement ring diamonds"" are an utter scam, and are simply ""worthless"". The fundamental, basic, overwhelming scam in todays businesssocial universe is ""engagement diamonds"". Yes, the price is only due to marketingmonopolies etc. Elephant in the room A GEs technology can  end of story  manufacture diamonds. Starting with ""pencil leads"". End of story. Its all over. Elephant in the room B folks forget that diamonds get beatup, they are just like used cars. Regarding ""engagementring diamonds"", nobody has ever, or will ever, bought a used one. Simple, utterly undeniable fact regarding ""engagement ring diamonds"". they have zero value. You cannot resell them. End of story. If you buy a house, you can resell it. If you buy a car, you can resell it at a spectacular loss. If you buy a picasso, you can resell it almost always making a huge profit. If you buy an ""engagement ring diamond"", it is worth nothing. Zero. Nada. strictly regarding investment stones, which is a distinctly utterly different market. This market has no connection, in any way, at all, even vaguely, it is utterly unrelated, to ""engagement ring diamonds"". You can in fact buy and sell these items  very much like say ""art"" or ""mid century antiques"", and make money. This market just has utterly no connection to the whole ""engagement ring diamonds"" scam system. Say you buy wine at the supermarket, for 5 to 100 bucks a bottle. If you think that the ""wine"" thus bought, has a secondary market, or you can invest in it or something you have lost your mind. In total contrast Yes, although totally flakey, there is indeed an ""investment wine market"" which is real and reasonable. I for example have made some money in that. I have a great anecdote even  I had one cellar of wine in burgundy, which could have been sold for, say, 30 grand  but we drank it   Again, the somewhat bizarre actual market in investment wine, just has to ""buying wine in the supermarket"". To further the analogy wine prices in the supermarket  your ROFL wine dealer, from 5 to 100 bucks, are just utterly laughable. Utterly. Laughable. Much as folks sit around, and decide on ""label designs"", they sit around, and decide on ""price points"". There is, utterly, no difference between 5 and 100 grape juice rofl ""wine"".

What would a stock be worth if dividends did not exist? [duplicate],"Unrealistic assumption, but Ill play along. Ultimately, dividends would exist because some innovative shareholder of some company, at some time, would desire income from their investment and could propose the idea of sharing the profit. Likeminded investors also desiring income could vote for dividends to come into existence  or, rather, vote for a board of directors that supports enactment of the idea. In your fictitious world, shareholders do still control the corporation, right? In this world, though, dividends wouldnt be called ""dividends"", a terrible name thats too ""mathy"" for the inhabitants of that world. Rather, they would institute a quarterly or annual shareholder profit share. Governments would enact legislation to approve ofnay, encourage such an innovation because it becomes a new source of recurring income they can tax. Alternatively, even if the idea of a cash dividend didnt occur to anybody in that world, investors would realize the stock price is depressed and could propose and vote for the board to institute share buybacks. The company repurchasing some portion of shares periodically would provide income to shareholders participating in the buyback. If the buyback were oversubscribed, they could structure it fairly prorata participation, etc. Alternatively, shareholders would pressure the board or fire them and vote in a new board to put the company up for sale and find a larger buyer, who would purchase the shares for cash.

What factors should I consider when evaluating index funds?,"The idea of an index is that it is representative of the market or a specific market segment as a whole, so it will move as the market does. Thus, past performance is not really relevant, unless you want to bank on relative differences between different countries economies. But thats not the point. By far the most important aspect when choosing index funds is the ongoing cost, usually expressed as Total Expense Ratio TER, which tells you how much of your investment will be eaten up by trading fees and to pay the funds operating costs and profits. This is where index funds beat traditional actively managed funds  it should be below 0.5 The next question is how buying and selling the funds works and what costs it incurs. Do you have to open a dedicated account or can you use a brokerage account at your bank? Is there an account management fee? Do you have to buy the funds at a markup can you get a discount on it? Are there flat trading fees? Is there a minimum investment? What lot sizes are possible? Can you set up a monthly payment plan? Can you automatically reinvest dividendscoupons? Then of course you have to decide which index, i.e. which market you want to buy into. My answer in the other question apparently didnt make it clear, but I was talking only about stock indices. You should generally stick to broad, established indices like the MSCI World, SP 500, Euro Stoxx, or in Australia the All Ordinaries. Among those, it makes some sense to just choose your home countrys main index, because that eliminates currency risk and is also often cheaper. Alternatively, you might want to use the opportunity to diversify internationally so that if your countrys economy tanks, you wont lose your job and see your investment take a dive.

"If Im cashflow negative, should I dollarcostaverage the money from my bonus over the entire year?","You will maximize your expected wealth by investing all the money you intend to invest, as soon as you have it available. Dont let the mythos of dollar cost averaging induce you to allocate more much money to a savings account than is optimal. If you want the positive expected return of the market, dont put your money in a savings account. Thats especially true now, when you are certainly earning a negative real interest rate on your savings account. Dollar cost averaging and putting all your money in at the beginning would have the same expected return except that if you put all your money in earlier, it spends more time in the market, so your expected return is higher. Your volatility is also higher because your savings account would have very low volatility but your preference for investment tells me that you view the expected return and volatility tradeoff of the stock market as acceptable. If you need something to help you feel less stress about investing right away, think of it as dollar cost averaging on a yearly basis instead of monthly. Further, you take take comfort in knowing that you have allocated your wealth as you can instead of letting it fizzle away in real terms in a bank account.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: If Im cashflow negative, should I dollarcostaverage the money from my bonus over the entire year?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"As an employer, how do I start a 401k or traditional IRA plan?","If you are the sole owner or just you and your spouse and expect to be that way for a few years, consider the benefits of an individual 401k. The contribution limits are higher than an IRA, and there are usually no fees involved. You can google ""Individual 401k"" and any of the major investment firms Fidelity, Schwab, etc will set one up free of charge. This option gives you a lot of freedom to decide how much money to put away without any plan management fees. The IRS site has all the details in an article titled OneParticipant 401k Plans. Once you have employees, if you want to set up a retirement plan for them, youll need to switch to a traditional, employersponsored 401k, which will involve some fees on your part. I seem to recall 2kyr in fees when I had a sponsored 401k for my company, and Im sure this varies widely. If you have employees and dont feel a need to have a companywide retirement plan, you can set up your own personal IRA and simply not offer a company plan to your employees. The IRA contribution limits are lower than an individual 401k, but setting it up is easy and feefree. So basically, if you want to spend 0 on plan management fees, get an individual 401k if you are selfemployed, or an IRA for yourself if you have employees.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

"In the UK, could lowincome pensioners or those near a lowincome retirement find a student loan useful for boosting their finances? ","As noted in richardbs comment buried in the commentsdebate on the other answer and all credit for this answer should be due to him a significant issue with the scheme as originally envisaged in the question up to 11K pa is that there is actually a cap on the maintenance part for over 60s On page 28 of this ""Student finance  how youre assessed and paid"" document it says If youre 60 or over on the first day of the first academic year of your course you can apply for a Maintenance Loan of up to 3,566, depending on your household income. Your loan will be reduced by 1 for every 5.46 of household income over 25,000, up to 43,675. If your household income is more than this you wont get any Maintenance Loan. Id consider that to make this route considerably less attractive... and maybe thats the intention of the rule! Although I might not think that was so true if I was actually on the UKs state pension of 6K a year and desperate. However, I was originally thinking more in terms of comparing the accumulated ""free money"" over the three years with the UKs average  and woefully inadequate  pension pot of 50K, rather than with pensioner income. Ill leave those who found the idea of exploiting government incentives so outrageous to ponder the at least as troubling ethics of discriminating against people based on their age, especially when that government apparently likes the idea of older people retraining. Just to complicate things I note that one of the possible criteria for applying for a ""special support grant""  an alternative to a maintenance loan  is being over 60. Thats a grant not a loan and doesnt have to be repaid, but abusing that would seem even to me to be on a par with faking disability to get benefits or similar.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: In the UK, could lowincome pensioners or those near a lowincome retirement find a student loan useful for boosting their finances?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

What are the contents of fixed annuities?,"This is really two questions about yield and contents. Content As others have noted, an annuity is a contractual obligation, not a portfolio contained within an investment product per se. The primary difference between whether an annuity is fixed or variable is what the issuer is guaranteeing and how much riskreward you are sharing in. Generally speaking, the holdings of an issuer are influenced by the average ""duration"" of the payments. However, you can ascertain the assets that ""back"" that promise by looking at, for example, the holdings of a large insurance or securities firm. That is why issuers are generally rated as to their financial strength and ability to meet their obligations. A number of the market failures you mentioned were in part caused by the failure of these ratings to represent the true financial strength of the firm. Yield As to the second question of how they can offer a competitive rate, there are at least several reasons I am assuming an immediate annuity  1 ReturnDepletion of Principal The 7 you are being quoted is the percent of your principal that will be returned to you each year, not the rate of return being earned by the issuer. If you invest 100 in the market personally and get a 5 return, you have 105. However, the annuitys issuer is also returning part of your principal to you each year in your payment, as they dont return your principal when you eventually die. Because of this, they can offer you more each year than they really make in the market. What makes a Ponzi scheme different is that they are also paying out your principal usually to others, but lie to you by telling you its still in your account.  2 The Time Value of Money A promise to pay you 500 tomorrow costs less than 500 today A fixed annuity promises to pay you a certain amount of money each year. This can be represented as a rate of return calculated based on how much you have to pay to get that annual payment, but it is important to remember that the first payment will be worth substantially more in real purchasing power than the last payment you get. The longer you live, the less your fixed payment is worth in real terms due to inflation! In short, the rate of return has to be discounted for inflation, it is not a ""real"" rate of return. In other words, if you give me 500 today and I promise to pay you 100 for the next 5 years, I am making money not only because I can invest the money between now and then, but also because 100 will be worth less five years from now than it is today. With annuities, if you want your payment to rise in step with inflation, you have to pay more for that a LOT more!. These are the two main reasons  here are a few smaller ones 3 A very long Time Horizon If the stock market or another asset class is performing wellpoorly, the issuer can often afford to wait much longer to buy or sell than an individual, and can take better advantage of historical highs and lows over the long term. 4 ""Big Boy"" investing A large, financially sound issuer can afford to take risks that an individual cannot, such as in very large or illiquid assets, such as a private company a la Warren Buffet. 5 Efficiencies of scale Institutional investors have a number of legal advantages over individuals, which I wont discuss in detail here. However, they exist. Large issuers are also often in related business insurance, mutual funds such that they can deal in large volumes and form an internal clearinghouse i.e. if I want to buy Facebook and you want to sell it, they can just move the stock around without doing any trading, with the result that their costs of trading are lower than those of an individual.

How do dividend reinvestment purchases work?,The Brokerage firm will purchase shares for the dividend paid in a omnibus account for the security of the issuer and then they will distribute fractional shares among all their clients that chose Div Reinvest. They will only have to buy 1 extra share to account for the fractional portion of what they allocate. The structure of the market does not permit trading of fractional shares. There is generally not any impact to the market place for Div Reinvest with the exception of certain securities that pay large dividends that are not liquid. sometimes this occurs in preferred securities where a large amount of Div reinvestment could create a large market order that has market impact. Most brokers place market orders for the opening on the day following the payment of the dividend. When you sell the fractional portion same process as full shares are sold into the market and the fractional if traded between you and the brokers omnibus account. if it creates a full share for the broker omnibus has .6 shares and you sell him .5 they would likely flip that out to the street with the full share portion of your order.

"Why invest for the longterm rather than buy and sell for quick, big gains?","The problem is that shortterm trends are really unpredictable. There is nobody who can accurately predict where a fund or even moreso, a single stock or bond is going to move in a few hours, or days or even months. The longterm trends of the entire market, however, are more or less predictable. There is a definite upward bias when you look at timescales of 5, 10, 20 years and more. Individual stocks and bonds may crash, and different sectors perform differently from year to year, but the market as a whole has historically always risen over long time scales. Of course, past performance never guarantees future performance. It is possible that everything could crash and never come back, but history shows that this would be incredibly unlikely. Which is the entire basis for strategies based on buying and holding and periodically rebalancing a portfolio containing funds that cover all market sectors. Now, regarding your 401k, you know your time horizon. The laws wont let you withdraw money without penalty until you reach retirement age  this might be 40 years, depending on your current age. So were definitely talking long term. You shouldnt care about where the market goes over a few months if you wont be using the money until 20 years from now. The most important thing for a 401k is to choose funds from those available to you that will be as diverse as possible. The actual allocation strategy is something you will need to work out with a financial advisor, since it will be different for every person. Once you come up with an appropriate allocation strategy, you will want to buy according to those ratios with every paycheck and rebalance your funds to those ratios whenever they start to drift away. And review the ratios with your advisor every few years, to keep them aligned with largescale trends and changes in your life.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why invest for the longterm rather than buy and sell for quick, big gains?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

If you look back further, you will see that interest rates paid by banks and credit unions are generally comparable. Credit union rates tend to be a little bit higher, but certainly not 7 times higher. The last time any financial institution paid as much as 15 on a savings account would probably be the early 1980s.

How to negotiate when you have something to give back?,"I dont think that there is a generic answer that will apply to this question across all goods. The answer depends on how the related businesses work, how much insight you have into the true value of the goods, and probably other things. Your car example is a good one that shows multiple options  There are dealers who will buy as a single transaction, sell as a single transaction, or do a simultaneous sell with tradein. I had a hot tub once, on the other hand, where I could find people who would do a tradein, but there was no dealer who would just buy my used tub. Theres not much parallel between the car and the tub because the options available are very different. To the extent that there is a generic answer, I generally agree with the point in keshlams answer about trying to avoid entrapment, but I take a slightly different view. If you want to get your best deal, you need to have an idea going into the process of what you want in net and keep focused on meeting your goal. If for some reason, its convenient for the dealer to ""move money around"" between the new car and the tradein, Im ok with that as long as Im getting what I want out of the deal. If possible, I prefer to deal with both transactions at once because its simpler. At the same time, Im willing to remove the tradein from the deal if Im not getting what I want. Threatening to do so can also give you some information about where the dealer really puts the value between the new car and tradein since, if you threaten to pull the tradein, the price on the car will probably change in response.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How to negotiate when you have something to give back?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Bottom line, it can make sense to buy a house for a year, only if you can reduce all the related transaction costs by doing them yourself. If there are many houses in the market for sale, I would try to convince someone to lease the house for a year in the best terms possible and maybe even try to sublease some of the rooms, or also renttoown the house.

"For very highnet worth individuals, does it make sense to not have insurance?","It depends. ""High net worth individuals"" is very subjective. Lets say a person is worth 1.5 million. High, but not super high. For one, they should have an umbrella policy. Until your net worth is above 300K, you really dont need an umbrella policy. They should insure their home and cars, but should probably have high deductibles. Health insurance is a must as a bad illness can wipe them out. They should have long term care insurance when they reach age 60. Now lets say a person is worth about 10 million. They might be able to self insure basic transportation and probably dont need long term care insurance. However, they may choose to carry the full coverage car insurance, or other lines, because it is a value. In conclusion insurance needs change based on a persons net worth and income. It is very hard to make a blanket statement without details of the makeup of ones net worth and how they earn their income. Having said all of that, a high net worth HNW individual may never be able to drop certain coverage. Lets say that a HNW owns a 50K condo, 1K square foot condo. Given that the outside structure is covered by the HOA the insurance on such a unit only covers the contents and liability. The contents could easily be floated by the HNW individual, but not the liability. It is probably a requirement, on their umbrella policy, that they carry the maximum liability protection on their vehicles and properties. In the case above they would carry a policy for the purposes of liability protection. This could also be true of their dependents. Say for example, their adult child receives some financial assistance from their parents like college being paid for. The HNW individuals should have their child cover the maximum liability on the auto policy. According to this site A person with a net worth of 1.5 million would be in the 9095 percentile, a person with 10 million in the 99th. This article does a decent job of describing what constitutes a HNW person or household.

Is there any drawback in putting all my 401K into a money market fund?,"What youre describing is called timing the market. That is, if you correctly predict when the market will drop, you can sell before the drop, wait for the drop, then buy after the drop has occurred. Sell high, buy low. The fundamental problem with that, though, is What ends up happening, on average, is you end up slightly behind. Theres quite a lot of literature on this see Betterments explanation for example. Forbes click through ad first also has a detailed piece on the matter. Now, were not really talking HFT issues here and there are some structural things that some argue you can take advantage of restrictions on some organizational investors, for example, similar to a blackjack dealer who has to hit on 16. However, everyone else knows about these too  so its hard to gain much of an edge. Plenty of people say they can time the market right, and even yourself perhaps you timed a particular drop accurately. This tends to lead to false confidence though how many drops that you timed badly do you remember? Ultimately, most investors end up slightly down when they attempt to time the market, because of the transaction costs if you guess two drops, one right and one wrong, and they have exactly opposite gainslosses before commissions, you will lose a bit on each due to commission, and because of the overall upward trend in the market ie, if you picked at random one month a year to be out of the market, youd lose around 10 annualized gains from doing that same applies here. All of that aside, there is one major caveat risk tolerance. If you are highly risk tolerant, say a 30 year old investing your 401k, then you should stay in no matter what. If youre not  say youre 58 and retiring in a few years  then knowledge that theres a higher risk time period coming up might suggest moving to a less risky portfolio, even at the known cost of some gains.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

"Choosing the right NAPFA advisor, and whether fees are fair, etc.?","The nature of this question finding a financial adviser can make it a conundrum. Those who have little financial experience are often in the greatest need of a financial adviser and at the same time are the least qualified to select one. Im not putting you or anyone in particular in this category. And of course its a sliding scale In general the more capable you are of running your own finances the more prepared you are to answer this question. With that said, I would recommend backing up half a step. Consider advisers other than strictly feeonly advisers. Perhaps you have already considered this decision. But perhaps others reading this have not. My Ameriprise adviser charges a monthly 50 fee, but also gets percentagebased portions of certain investments. Based on a 150hr rate that amounts to four hours per year. Does he spend four hours per year on my account? Well so far he does 2 yrs. But that is determined primarily by how much interaction I choose to have with him. I suppose I could spend more time asking him questions and less time on this forum. P I have never fully understood the gravitation towards feebased advisers on principle. I guess the theory is they are not making biased decisions about your investments because they dont have as much of a stake in how well your investments to do. I dont necessarily see that as an advantage. It seems they would have less of an incentive to ensure the growth of your investments. Although if youre nearing retirement then growth isnt your biggest concern. Perhaps a feebased adviser makes more sense in that scenario. Whatever pay structure your adviser uses, it would seem to make sense to consider a successful adviser with a good client base. This implies that the adviser knows what heshe is doing. But it could also just be a sign that they are good at marketing themselves. If your adviser has a good base of wealthy clients then choosing a strictlyfee based adviser would mitigate the risk of your adviser having less incentive to consider your portfolio vs that of more wealthy clients. To more directly answer your question I suggest asking several of your adviser candidates for advice on choosing an adviser. I suspect you will get some good advice as well as good insight on the integrity and honesty of the adviser.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Choosing the right NAPFA advisor, and whether fees are fair, etc.?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Why do Americans have to file taxes, even if their only source of income is from a regular job?","There are a few reasons 1 Deductions and credits. We have a lot of them. While I suppose we could pass this information on to our employers for them to file, why would we want to? That just unnecessarily adds a middleman as well as sharing potentially private information more than it needs to be shared. This is the one that effects the most people. 2 Income sources. While normal employment, contract work, and normal investment income already gets reported to the IRS, this is not true for all sources of income. For one, the U.S. is almost completely by itself on actually taxing income that its citizens earn outside of the U.S. While this policy is completely absurd, the only way for the government to know about such income is for the person to report it, since the IRS cant require foreign employers to send information to them. Also, barter income as well as other income that doesnt meet the qualifications for the payer to be required to inform the government requires the employee to selfreport. Similarly, capital gains on things outside of normal investments real estate, for instance require selfreporting. Having said all of this, U.S. reporting requirements are absurd and illogical. For instance, the IRS already knows about all of my stock trading activity. My broker is required to report it to them. Yet, I still have to list out every single trade on my own return, which is really tedious and completely redundant. For charitable contributions, on the other hand, I only have to give the IRS the final total without listing out all of the individual donations, despite the fact that they dont have that information made available to them by another source. It makes no sense at all, but such is the federal government.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do Americans have to file taxes, even if their only source of income is from a regular job?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

What part of buying a house would make my net worth go down?,"In general, buying a house will improve your net worth over the long haul, because unlike cars, houses dont suffer as much from depreciation. The problem with real property is that markets are very cyclic and arent very liquid assets. Farmers with thousands of acres of valuable land are often cash poor for that very reason.

"For net worth, should I value physical property at my cost to replace it, or the amount I could get for selling it?","Youre asking for opinions here, because its a matter of how you look at it. Ill give it a shot anyway. For insurance purposes  theres a clear answer you insure based on how much it would cost you to replace it. For some reason, youre considering as a possibility negotiating with the insurance company about that, but Ive never heard of insuring something at a ""possible sales value"" unless youre talking about a one of a kind thing, or a particularly valuable artifact art, jewelry, etc. That it would be appraised and insured based on the appraised value. Besides, most of the stuff usually loses value once you bought it, not gains, so insuring per replacement costs makes more sense because it costs more. As to your estimations of your own net worth to yourself  its up to you. I would say that something only worth what people would pay for it. So if you have a car that you just bought brand new, replacing it would cost you X, but you can only sell it for X10, because it depreciated by at least 10 once youve driven it off the dealers lot. So I would estimate your worth as X10 based on the car, not X, because although you spent X on it  you can never recover it if you sell it, so you cant claim to have it as your ""net worth"".","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: For net worth, should I value physical property at my cost to replace it, or the amount I could get for selling it?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"What exactly can a financial advisor do for me, and is it worth the money?","There are several types of financial advisors. Some are associated with brokerages and insurance companies and the like. Their services are often free. On the other hand, the advice they give you will generally be strongly biased toward their own companys products, and may be biased toward their own profits rather than your gains. Remember, anything free is being paid for by someone, and if you dont know who its generally going to be you. There are some who are good, but I couldnt give you any advice on finding them. Others are not associated with any of the above, and serve entirely as experts who can suggest ways of distributing your money based on your own needs versus resources versus risktolerance, without any affiliation to any particular company. Consulting these folks does cost you or, if its offered as a benefit, your employer some money, but their fiduciary responsibility is clearly to you rather than to someone else. They arent likely to suggest you try anything very sexy, but when it comes to your primary longterm savings ""exciting"" is usually not a good thing. The folks I spoke to were of the latter type. They looked at my savings and my plans, talked to me about my risk tolerance and my goals, picked a fairly ""standard"" strategy from their files, ran simulations against it to sanitycheck it, and gave me a suggested mix of lowoverhead index fund types that takes almost zero effort to maintain rebalance occasionally between funds, has acceptable levels of risk, and I admit Ive been lucky has been delivering more than acceptable returns. Nothing exciting, but even though Im relatively risktolerant Id say excitement is the last thing I need in my longterm savings. I should actually talk to them again some time soon to sanitycheck a few things they can also offer advice on other financial decisions whetherwhen I might want to talk to charities about gift annuity plans, whether Roth versus traditional 401k makes any difference at all at this point in my career, and so on.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What exactly can a financial advisor do for me, and is it worth the money?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?,"Its important because it shows that the amount you owe does not decrease linearly with each payment, and you gain equity as a correspondingly slower rate at the beginning of the loan and faster at the end. This has to be figured in when considering refinancing, or when you sell the place and pay off the mortgage. It also shows why making extra payments toward principal if your loan permits doing so is so advantageous  unlike a normal payment that lowers the whole curve by a notch, reducing the length of time over which interest is due and thus saving you money in the long run.

"Car finance, APR rates and per week in adverts help understanding them","Easier to copy paste than type this out. Credit www.financeformulas.net Note that the present value would be the initial loan amount, which is likely the sale price you noted minus a down payment. The loan payment formula is used to calculate the payments on a loan. The formula used to calculate loan payments is exactly the same as the formula used to calculate payments on an ordinary annuity. A loan, by definition, is an annuity, in that it consists of a series of future periodic payments. The PV, or present value, portion of the loan payment formula uses the original loan amount. The original loan amount is essentially the present value of the future payments on the loan, much like the present value of an annuity. It is important to keep the rate per period and number of periods consistent with one another in the formula. If the loan payments are made monthly, then the rate per period needs to be adjusted to the monthly rate and the number of periods would be the number of months on the loan. If payments are quarterly, the terms of the loan payment formula would be adjusted accordingly. I like to let loan calculators do the heavy lifting for me.

"Im 20 and starting to build up for my mortgage downpayment, where should I put my money for optimal growth?","You should never take advice from someone else in relation to a question like this. Who would you blame if things go wrong and you lose money or make less than your savings account. For this reason I will give you the same answer I gave to one of your previous similar questions If you want higher returns you may have to take on more risk. From lowest returns and usually lower risk to higher returns and usually higher risk, Bank savings accounts, term deposits, online savings accounts, offset accounts if you have a mortgage, fixed interest eg. Bonds, property and stock markets. If you want potentially higher returns then you can go for derivatives like options or CFDs, FX or Futures. These usually have higher risks again but as with any investments some risks can be partly managed. What ever you decide to do, get yourself educated first. Dont put any money down unless you know what your potential risks are and have a risk management strategy in place, especially if it is from advice provided by someone else. The first rule before starting any new investment is to understand what your potential risks are and have a plane to manage and reduce those risks.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Im 20 and starting to build up for my mortgage downpayment, where should I put my money for optimal growth?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Can LLC legally lend money to a friend?,"Legally, I cant find any reason that the LLC could not lend money to an individual. However, I believe the simplest course of action is to first distribute money from your company to your personal account, and then make it a personal loan. Whether the loan is done through the business or personally, financially I dont think there is much difference as to which bucket the interest income goes into, since your business and personal income will all get lumped together anyway with a single person LLC. Even if your friend defaults on the loan, either the business or you personally will have the same burden of proof to meet that the loan was not a gift to begin with, and if that burden is met, the deduction can be taken from either side.

Why is there such disparity of max contribution limits between 401K accounts and regular IRA accounts?,"The investments offered in 401K are usually limited to a selection of mutual funds offered by a 401K provider. The 401K providers and the mutual funds charge fees. The mutual fund industry has a lobbying group that will push for increased 401K contributions to direct money into their mutual funds to collect fees. The top 401 K provider in 2005 was fidelity. It managed 337 billion in 401Ks of which 334 billion was directed into mutual funds. Although I would have to use some of the same providers to open an IRA, I would not have to invest in the providers mutual funds when I open an IRA. I can buy a stock and hold onto it for 10, 20, 50 years inside of my IRA. Thus, the only fee the investment company would collect from me would be from when I purchased the stock and when I sold the stock. Not nearly as profitable as mutual fund fees.","What are the roles and responsibilities of the administrator, broker, and custodian in managing a Solo 401(k), especially during account setup and IRS reporting?","As the administrator of a Solo 401(k), you're responsible for compliance and IRS reporting.

Can someone explain the Option Chain of AMD for me?,"When you buy a put option, youre buying the right to sell stock at the ""strike"" price. To understand why you have to pay separately for that, consider the other side of the transaction. If I agree to trade stock for money at above market rates, I need to make up the difference somewhere or face bankruptcy. That risk of loss is what the option price is about. You might assume that means the market expects the price of AMD to fall to 8.01 from its current price of 8.06 by the option expiration date. But that would also mean call options below the market price is worthless. But thats not quite true people who price options need to factor in volatility, since things change with time. The price MIGHT fall, and traders need to account for that risk. So 1.99 roughly represents the probability of AMD rising to 10.

"When one pays Quarterly Estimated Self Employment Taxes, exactly what are they paying?","Your question does not say this explicitly, but I assume that you were once a W2 employee. Each paycheck a certain amount was withheld from your check to pay income, social security, and medicare taxes. Just because you did not receive that amount of money earned does not mean it was immediately sent to the IRS. While I am not all that savvy on payroll procedures, I recall an article that indicated some companies only send in withheld taxes every quarter, much like you are doing now. They get a short term interest free loan. For example taxes withheld by a w2 employee in the later months of the year may not be provided to the IRS until 15 January of the next year. You are correct in assuming that if you make 100K as a W2 you will probably pay less in taxes than someone who is 100K self employed with 5K in expenses. However there are many factors. Provided you properly fill out a 1040ES, and pay the correct amount of quarterly payments, you will almost never owe taxes. In fact my experience has been the forms will probably allow you to receive a refund. Tax laws can change and one thing the form did not include last year was the .9 Medicare surcharge for high income earners catching some by surprise. As far as what you pay into is indicative of the games the politicians play. It all just goes into a big old bucket of money, and more is spent by congress than what is in the bucket. The notion of a ""social security lockbox"" is pure politicsfantasy as well as the notion of medicare and social security taxes. The latter were created to make the actual income tax rate more palatable. Id recommend getting your taxes done as early as possible come 1 January 2017. While you may not have all the needed info, you could firm up an estimate by 15 Jan and modify the amount for your last estimated payment. Complete the taxes when all stuff comes in and even if you owe an amount you have time to save for anything additional. Keep in mind, between 1 Jan 17 and 15 Apr 17 you will earn and presumably save money to use towards taxes. You can always ""rob"" from that money to pay any owed tax for 2016 and make it up later. All that is to say you will be golden because you are showing concern and planning.

Can a credit card company raise my rates for making a large payment?,"No. Credit card companies will typically not care about your individual credit card account.

If an entire packages or slices balance drops significantly, theyll take a look, and will adjust rates accordingly often they may actually decrease rates as an incentive to increase you use of the card. Because credit card debt is unstructured debt, the bank cannot impose an ""early payment penalty"" of any kind theres no schedule for paying it off, so theres no way to prove that theyre missing out on X in interest because you paid early. Generally, banks dont like CC debt anyway its very risky debt, and they often end up writing large balances off for pennies on the dollar.

Is the interest on money borrowed on margin infor an RRSP considered tax deductible?,"I believe your question is based on a false premise.

You cant borrow money from your broker within your RRSP. If you want to borrow money to invest in your RRSP, you must borrow outside from another source, and make a contribution to your RRSP. And, if you do this, the loan interest is not considered tax deductible. In order for investment loan interest to be tax deductible, youd need to invest outside of a registered type of account, e.g. using a regular nontaxsheltered account.

The Big Short  shorting vs CDS,"To be able to truly short something you technically need to be able to borrow the security so you can sell it.

How should I be investing in bonds as part of a diversified portfolio?,"Buy a fund of bonds, there are plenty and are registered on your stockbroker account as funds rather than shares. Otherwise, to the individual investor, they can be considered as the same thing. Funds of bonds, rather than funds that contain property or shares or other investments are often high yield, low volatility. You buy the fund, and let the manager work it for you. He buys bonds in accordance to the specification of the fund ie some funds will say European only, or global high yield etc and he will buy and sell the bonds regularly. You never hold to maturity as this is handled for you  in many cases, the manager will be buying and selling bonds all the time in order to give you a stable fund that returns you a dividend. Private investors can buy bonds directly, but its not common. Should you do it? Up to you. Bonds return, the company issuing a corporate bond will do so at a fixed price with a fixed yield. At the end of the term, they return the principal. So a 20year bond with a 5 yield will return someone who invests 10k, 500 a year and at the end of the 20 years will return the 10k. The corporate doesnt care who holds the bond, so you can happily sell it to someone else, probably for 10km give or take. People say to invest in bonds because they do not move much in value. In financially difficult times, this means bonds are more attractive to investors as they are a safe place to hold money while stocks drop, but in good times the opposite applies, noone wants a fund returning 5 when they think they can get 20 growth from a stock.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How should I be investing in bonds as part of a diversified portfolio?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Do I need another health insurance policy?,"While I cant say how it is in the Philippines, my wife the insurance broker leads me to believe that individual insurance is more expensive than group coverages in the US almost always. So much so that people will go to great extents to form any sort of business just to insure themselves. If however it is cheaper, cant you simply opt out of your employers plan? If you can opt out, will your employer give you any of the money they arent paying for your insurance? If you cant opt out, or if you paycheck doesnt grow, I cant see why you would want additional coverage especially at such a young age. Should you lose your job in the near future and you worry about, go get the insurance then. EDIT One big advantage is if you get personal insurance, you might need to get an exam to qualify, and it is likely the younger you are the better you will qualify.

Are PINs always needed for paying with card?,"Security in the merchant services system is mainly handled in two ways 1 Before transactions are done, the business itself must go through an application process similar but not identical to getting a loan. Some high risk businesses must pay higher fees due to the increased likelihood of customer complaints. 2 When a customer disputes a transaction, thats a mark against the business. Get too many of these disputes, and your priviledge of accepting credit cards will be revoked, meaning you wont be able to again.

Tax treatment of renovation costs and mortgage interest on a second house,"Should I treat this house as a second home or a rental property on my 2015 taxes? If it was not rented out or available for rent then you could treat it as your second home. But if it was available for rent i.e. you started advertising, you hired a property manager, or made any other step towards renting it out, but you just didnt happen to find a tenant yet  then you cannot. So it depends on the facts and circumstances. Ive read that if I treat this house as a rental property, then the renovation cost is a capital expenditure that I can claim on my taxes by depreciating it over 28 years. That is correct. 27.5 years, to be exact. Ive also read that if I treat this house as a personal second home, then I cannot do that because the renovation costs are considered nondeductible personal expenses. That is not correct. In fact, in both cases the treatment is the same. Renovation costs are added to your basis. In case of rental, you get to depreciate the house. Since renovations are considered part of the house, you get to depreciate them too. In case of a personal use property, you cannot depreciate. But the renovation costs still get added to the basis. These are not expenses. But does mortgage interest get deducted against my total income or only my rental income? If it is a personal use second home  you get to deduct the mortgage interest up to a limit on your Schedule A. Depending on your other deductions, you may or may not have a tax benefit. If it is a rental  the interest is deducted from the rental income only on your Schedule E. However, theres no limit although some may be deferred if the deduction is more than the income if youre renting at fair market value. Any guidance would be much appreciated!

"Should Emergency Funds be Used for Infrequent, but Likely, Expenses?","Which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover?

If you find youre spending more than you thought, just increase the amount. You can use envelopes for each type of expense, have a separate checking account for those, whatever.

Home insurance score drastically decreases after car insurance claim?,"Credit risk and insurance risk are highly correlated for a single legal party. Trouble with one could indicate trouble with another. Any increase in credit risk such as new borrowing will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of insurance risk, manifested as a fraudulent or subconsciously induced claim. Any claim of insurance will be perceived to be an increased likelihood of default, manifested as a default, voluntary or not. To a creditorinsurer, only the law applies therefore, private arrangements between the borrowerinsured and third parties do not factor because the creditorinsurer has no hope of recourse against such third parties in most places around the world. Regardless of whether there is a price ceiling on compensation for damages to assets, limiting an insurers costs, if a risk is realized then it can be presumed through sequential sampling as well as other reliable statistical techniques that future risk has risen. The aforementioned risk dominoes subsequently fall. Generally speaking, the lower ones financial variance, the lower the financial costs. In other words, uncertainty can be mostly quantified with variance and other mathematical moments as well. Any uncertainty is a cost to a producer thus a cost to the consumer. A consumer who is perfectly predictable with good outcomes will pay much lower costs on average than not, so one who keeps a tight financial ship, not exposing oneself to financial risks and better yet not realizing financial risks, will see less financial variance, thus will enjoy lower costs to financing, which includes insuring.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Home insurance score drastically decreases after car insurance claim?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"A debt collector will not allow me to pay a debt, what steps should I take?","This is somewhat unbelievable. I mean if you had a business of collecting debts, wouldnt you want to collect said debts? Rather than attempting to browbeat people with these delinquent debts into paying, you have someone volunteering to pay. Would you want to service that client? This would not happen in just about any other industry, but such is the lunacy of debt collecting. The big question is why do you need this cleared off your credit? If it is just for a credit score, it probably is not as important as your more recent entries. I would just wait it out, until 7 years has passed, and you can then write the reporting agencies to remove it from your credit. If you are attempting to buy a home or similarly large purpose and the mortgage company is insisting that you deal with this, then I would do the following Write the company to address the issue. This has to be certifiedreturn receipt requested. If they respond, pay it and insist that it be marked as paid in full on your credit. I would do this with a money order or cashiers check. Done. Dispute the charge with the credit reporting agencies, providing the documentation of no response. This should remove the item from your credit. Provide this documentation to the mortgage broker. This should remove any hangup they might have. Optional Sue the company in small claims court. This will take a bit of time and money, but it should yield a profit. There was a post on here a few days ago about how to do this. Make part of any settlement to have your name cleared of the debt.

devastated with our retirement money that we have left,"It sounds like the kinds of planners youre talking to might be a poor fit, because they are essentially salespersons selling investments for a commission. Some thoughts on finding a financial planner The good kind of financial planner is going to be able to do a comprehensive plan  look at your whole life, goals, and noninvestment issues such as insurance. You should expect to get a document with a Monte Carlo simulation showing your odds of success if you stick to the plan for investments, you should expect to see a recommended asset allocation and an emphasis on lowcost nocommission commission is ""load"" funds. See some of the other questions from past posts, for example What exactly can a financial advisor do for me, and is it worth the money? A good place to start for a planner might be httpnapfa.org  theres also a franchise of planners providing hourly advice called the Garrett Planning Network, I helped my mom hire someone from them and she was very happy, though I do think your results would depend mostly on the individual rather than the franchise. Anyway see httpwww.garrettplanningnetwork.commap.html , they do require planners to be feeonly and working on their CFP credential. You should really look for the Certified Financial Planner CFP credential. There are a lot of credentials out there, but many of them mean very little, and others might be hard to get but not mean the right thing. Some other meaningful ones include Chartered Financial Analyst CFA which would be a solid investment expert, though not necessarily someone knowledgeable in financial planning generally and IRS Enrolled Agent, which means someone who knows a lot about taxes. A CPA accountant would also be pretty meaningful. A law degree and estate law knowhow is very relevant to many planning situations, too. Some notverymeaningful certifications include Certified Mutual Fund Specialist which isnt bogus, but its much easier to get than CFP or CFA Registered Investment Adviser RIA which mostly means the person is supposed to understand securities fraud laws, but doesnt mean they know a lot about financial planning. There are some pretty bogus certifications out there, many have ""retirement"" or ""senior"" in the name. A good question for any planner is ""Are you a fiduciary?"" which means are they legally required to act in your interests and not their own. Most salesoriented advisors are not fiduciaries they wouldnt charge you a big sales commission if they were, and they are not ""on your side"" legally speaking. Its a good idea to check with your state regulators or the SEC to confirm that your advisor is registered and ask if they have had any complaints. Small advisors usually register with the state and larger ones with the federal SEC. If they are registered, they may still be a salesperson who isnt acting in your interests, but at least they are following the law. You can also see if theyve been in trouble in the past. When looking for a planner, one firm I found had a professional looking web site and didnt seem sketchy at all, but the state said they were not properly registered and not in compliance. Other ideas A good book is httpwww.amazon.comSmartSimpleFinancialStrategiesPeopledp0743269942 its very approachable and youd feel more confident talking to someone maybe with more background information. For companies to work with, stick to the ones that are very consumerfriendly and sell noload funds. Vanguard is probably the one youll hear about most. But T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, USAA are some other good names. Fidelity is a bit of a mixture, with some cheap consumerfriendly investments and other products that are less so. Avoid companies that are all about charging commission pretty much anyone selling an annuity is probably bad news. Annuities have some valid uses but mostly they are a bad deal. Not knowing your specific situation in any detail, its very likely that 60k is not nearly enough, and that making the right investment choices will make only a small difference. You could invest poorly and maybe end up with 50K when you retire, or invest well and maybe end up with 8090k. But your goal is probably more like a million dollars, or more, and most of that will come from future savings. This is what a planner can help you figure out in detail. Its virtually certain that any planner who is for real, and not a ripoff salesperson, will talk a lot about how much you need to save and so forth, not just about choosing investments. Dont be afraid to pay for a planner. Its well worth it to pay someone a thousand dollars for a really thorough, fiduciary plan with your interests foremost. The ""free"" planners who get a commission are going to get a whole lot more than a thousand dollars out of you, even though you wont write a check directly. Be sure to convert those mutual fund expense ratios and sales commissions into actual dollar amounts! To summarize find someone youre paying, not someone getting a commission look for that CFP credential showing they passed a demanding exam maybe read a quick and easy book like the one I mentioned just so you know what the advisor is talking about and dont rush into anything!

Effect of country default on house prices?,"It could be a a way to preserve the value of your money, but depends upon various factors. If a country defaults, and it leads to hyperinflation, by definition that means that money loses its purchasing power. In even simpler terms, it cannot buy as much tomorrow as I could today. Therefore people can be incented to either hoard physical goods, or other nonperishable items. Realestate may well be such an item. If you are resident in the country, you have to live somewhere. It is possible that a landlord might try to raise rent beyond what your job is willing to pay. Of course, in a house, you might have a similar situation with utilities like electricity...

How and why does the sale of financial instrument equate to the receipt of dividends? In either case, one has cash equivalents that could be withdrawn. If you take the dividends in cash or sell a security to raise cash, you have cash. Thus, it doesnt matter what origin it has.

In the case of a dividend, Id still possess the financial security and benefit from the stocks appreciation?

First concrete steps for retirement planning when one partner is resistant,"To answer your question As far as whats available in addition to your 401k at work most financial types will say to contribute up to the match first, you may qualify for a Roth IRA qualification is based on income, if not, then you may have to go with a Traditional IRA. You and your husband can each have one and contribute up to the limit each year. After that, you could get just a straight up mutual fund, andor contribute up to limit on your 401k. My two cents This may sound counterintuitive and Im sure some folks will disagree, but instead of contributing to your 401k now, take whatever that amount is, and use it to pay extra on the car loan. Also take the extra being paid on the mortgage and pay it on the car loan too.

What happens to options if a company is acquired  bought out?,"A lot may depend on the nature of a buyout, sometimes its is for stock and cash, sometimes just stock, or in the case of this google deal, all cash. Since that deal was used, well discuss what happens in a cash buyout. If the stock price goes high enough before the buyout date to put you in the money, pull the trigger before the settlement date in some cases, it might be pulled for you, see below. Otherwise, once the buyout occurs you will either be done or may receive adjusted options in the stock of the company that did the buyout not applicable in a cash buyout. Typically the price will approach but not exceed the buyout price as the time gets close to the buyout date. If the buyout price is above your option strike price, then you have some hope of being in the money at some point before the buyout just be sure to exercise in time. You need to check the fine print on the option contract itself to see if it had some provision that determines what happens in the event of a buyout. That will tell you what happens with your particular options. For example Joe Taxpayer just amended his answer to include the standard language from CBOE on its options, which if I read it right means if you have options via them you need to check with your broker to see what if any special exercise settlement procedures are being imposed by CBOE in this case.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What happens to options if a company is acquired  bought out?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Can paying down a mortgage be considered an investment?,"Your mortgage represents a negative cash flow of X for N months. The typical mortgage prepayment doesnt reduce your next payment, but does reduce the length of the mortgage. If you look at the amortization table of a 30 year loan, you might see a payment of 1000 but only 50 going to principal. So if on day one you send an extra 51 or so to the bank, you find that in 30 years you just saved that 1000 payment. In effect, it was a long term bond or CD, yielding the post tax rate of the mortgage. Say your loan were 7. At 7, money doubles every 10 years or so. 30 years is 3 doubles or 8X. If I were to offer you 1000 and ask for 7500 in 30 years, you might accept it, with an agreement to buy me out if you refinanced. For me, that would be an investment. Just like buying a bond. In fact, there is a real return, as you see the cash flow at the end. The payments not made are your payback. Those who insist its not an investment are correct in the strict sense of the words definition, but pedantic for the fact in practice, the prepayment is a choice to be considered alongside other investment choices. When I have a mortgage, I am the mortgagor, the bank, the mortgagee. Same as a company issuing a bond, the Bank holds my bond and Im making payments to them. They hold my bond as an investment. There is no question of that. In fact, they package these and sell them as CMOs, groups of mortgages. A prepayment is me buying back the last coupon on my mortgage. I fail to see the distinction between me buying back 10K in future coupons on my own loan or me investing 10K in someone elses loans. The real question for me is whether this makes sense when rates are so low. At 4, Id say its a matter of prioritizing any high rate debt and any other investments that might yield more. But even so, its an investment yielding 4. Over the years, Ive developed the priorities of where to put new money  The priorities are debatable. I have my opinion, and my reasons to back them up. In general, its a balance between risk and return. In my opinion, theres something wrong with ignoring a dollar for dollar match on the 401k in most circumstances. Others seem to prefer being 100 debt free before saving at all. Theres a balance that might be different for each individual. As I started, the mortgage is a fixed return, with no chance to just get it back if needed. If your cash savings is pretty high, and the choice is a .001 CD or prepay a 4 mortgage, Id use some funds to pay it down. But not to the point you have no liquid reserves.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Can paying down a mortgage be considered an investment?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"I have an extra 1000 per month, what should I do with it?","Lots of good advice on investing already. You may also want to think about two things A Bausparvertrag. You can set this up for different monthly saving rates. Youll get a modest interest payment, and once you have saved up enough the contract is zuteilungsreif, you will be eligible for a loan at a low rate. However, you can only use the loan for building, buying or renovating real estate. With interest rates as low as they are right now, this is not overly attractive. However, depending on your salary, you may qualify for subsidies, and these could indeed be rather attractive. This may be helpful in German. A RiesterRente. This is a subsidized saving scheme  you save something every year and again get subsidies at the end of the year. I think the salary thresholds where you qualify for a subsidy are a bit higher for the RiesterRente than for a Bausparvertrag, and even if you dont qualify for a subsidy, your contributions will be deducted from your taxable income. I wouldnt invest all my leftover money in these, considering that you commit yourself for the medium to long term, but they might well be attractive options for at least part of your money, say 2025 of what you aim at saving every month. Finally, as others have written banks and insurance companies exist to make money, and they live off their provisions.

Rental Properties Is it good or bad that I cant find rental listings on that street?,"Based on the information you gave, there are dozens if not hundreds of possible theories one could spin about the rental market. Sure, its possible that there are no listings because rental units on this street are quickly snapped up. On the other hand, its also possible that there are no listings because almost all the buildings on the street have been abandoned and, aside from this one property that someone is tying to sell you, the rest of the street is inhabited only by wild dogs andor drug dealers. Or maybe the street is mostly owneroccupied, i.e. the properties are not being rented to anyone. Or maybe its a commercial district. Or maybe craigslist isnt popular with people who own property on this street for whatever reason. Maybe Syracuse has a city ordinance that says property must be advertised in the newspaper and not on websites, for all I know. Or maybe you missed it because nobody in Syracuse calls it ""housing for rent"", they all call it ""apartments for rent"" or ""houses for rent"" or some local phrase. Or ... or ... or.

Could the loan officer deny me even if I have the money as a first time home buyer?,"My credentials I used to work on mortgages, about 5 years ago. I wasnt a loan officer the salesman or mortgage processor the grunt who does the real work, but I reviewed their work fairly closely. So Im not an absolute authority, but I have firsthand knowledge. Contrary to the accepted answer, yes the bank is obligated to offer you a loan  if you meet their qualifications. This may sound odd, and as though its forcing a bank to give money when it doesnt want to, but there is good reason. Back in the 1950s through 1980s, banks tended to deny loans to African Americans who were able to buy nicer homes because the loan officer didnt quite feel like they were capable of paying off an expensive house, even if they had the exact same history and income as a white person who did get approved. After several rounds of trying to fix this problem, the government finally decreed that the bank must have a set, written criteria by which it will approve or decline loans, and the interest rates provided. It can change that criteria, but those changes must apply to all new customers. Banks are allowed a bit of discretion to approve loans that they may normally decline, but must have a written reason usually its due to some relationship with the customers business this condition adds a lot of extra rules, or that customer has a massive family and all 11 other siblings have gotten loans from the same loan officer  random rare stuff that can be easily documented ifwhen the government asks. The bank has no discretion to decline a loan at will  Ive seen 98yearolds sign a 30year mortgage, and the bank was overjoyed because it showed that they didnt discriminate against the elderly. The customer could be a crackhead, and the bank cant turn them down if their paperwork, credit, and income is good. The most the loan officer could do is process the loan slowly and hope the crackhead gets arrested before the bank spends any more money. The regulations for employees new to the workforce are a bit less wonderful, but the bank will want 30 days of income history 30 days, NOT 4 weeks if you have it. BUT, if you are a fresh new employee, they can do the loan using your written and signed job offer as proof of income. However, I discourage you from using this method to buy a house. You are much, much better off renting for a while and learning the local area before you shop for a house. Its too easy to buy a house without knowing the city, then discover that you have a hideously slow drive to work and are in the worst part of town. And, you may not like the company as much, or you may not be a good fit. Its not uncommon to leave a company within a year or two. You dont want a house that anchors you to one place while you need the freedom to explore career options. And consider this banks love selling mortgages, but they hate holding them. They want to collect that 10,000 closing fee, they couldnt care less about the 4 interest trickling in over 30 years. Once they sign the mortgage, they try to sell it to investors who want to buy highgrade debt within a month. That sale gives them all the money back, so they can use it to sell another mortgage and collect another 10,000. If the bank has its way, it has offloaded your mortgage before you send the first payment to them. As a result, its a horrible idea to buy a house unless you expect to live there at least 5 or 10 years, because the closing costs are so high.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Could the loan officer deny me even if I have the money as a first time home buyer?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Debt collector has wrong person and is contacting my employer,"Step one Contact the collection agency. Tell them that they have the wrong person, and the same name is just a coincidence. I would NOT give them my correct social security number, birth date, or other identifying information. This could be a total scam for the purpose of getting you to give them such personal identifying information so they can perform an identity theft. Even if it is a legitimate debt collection agency, if they are overzealous andor incompetent, they may enter your identifying information into their records. ""Oh, you say your social security number isnt 123456789, but 234567890. Thank you, let me update our records. Now, sir, I see that the social security number in our records matches your social security number ..."" Step two If they dont back off, contact a lawyer. Collection agencies work by  call it ""intimidation"" or ""moral persuasion"", depending on your viewpoint. Years after my wife left me, she went bankrupt. A collection agency called me demanding payment of her debts before the bankruptcy went through. I noticed two things about this One, We were divorced and I had no responsibility for her debts. Somehow they tracked down my new address and phone number, a place where she had never even lived. Why should I pay her debts? I had no legal obligation, nor did I see any moral obligation. Two, Their pitch was that sheI should pay off this debt before the bankruptcy was final. Why would anyone do that? The whole point of declaring bankruptcy is so you dont have to pay these debts. They were hoping to intimidate her into paying even though she wouldnt be legally obligated to pay. If you dont owe the money, of course theres no reason why you should pay it. If they continue to pursue you for somebody elses debt, in the U.S. you can sue them for harassment. There are all sorts of legal limits on what collection agencies are allowed to do. Actually even if they do back off, it might be worth contacting a lawyer. I suspect that asking your employer to garnish your wages without a court order, without even proof that you are responsible for this debt, is a tort that you could sue them for.",What impact would a U.S. debt default have on personal bank accounts and financial markets in the short term?,"A default could shake markets, but your FDIC-insured bank deposits (up to $250K) would likely remain unaffected."
"Why do Americans have to file taxes, even if their only source of income is from a regular job?","One significant reason it makes sense for filing to be the default is home ownership rates. I think far more so than investment income, Americans own homes as there is a significant mortgage interest deduction, between that and investments a large number of Americans would have to file about a third of Americans get the mortgage interest tax deduction, and a large chunk of the richest dont qualify but would have to file for investments anyway. We also have a very complicated tax code, with nearly everyone getting some kind of deduction. Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor folks making, say, 30k for a family of 4 with a fulltime job get several thousand dollars in refundable credits, for example, the Student Loan interest deduction, the above mortgage deduction, almost everyone gets something. Finally, your employer may not know about your family situation. As we have tax credits and deductions for families based on number of children, for example, its possible your employer doesnt know about those if you dont get health insurance on their behalf, they may well not know. Start reporting things like that separately... and you end up with about as much work as filing is now.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do Americans have to file taxes, even if their only source of income is from a regular job?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

How does a CFD work behind the scenes?,There are several ways that the issuers profit from CFDs. If the broker has trades on both sides buy and sell they can net the volumes off against each other and profit off the spread whilst using the posted margins to cover pl from both sides. Because settlement for most securities is not on the same day that the order is placed they can also buy the security with no intention of taking delivery and simply sell it off at the end of day to pass delivery on to someone else. Here again they profit from the spread and that their volumes give them really low commissions so their costs are much lower than the value of the spread. If they have to do this rather than netting the position out the spreads will be wider. Sometimes that may be forced to buy the security outright but that is rare and the spreads will be even wider so that they can make a decent profit.,What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does a CFD work behind the scenes?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What exactly do fund managers of index trackers do?,"From How are indexes weighted? Marketcapitalization weighted indexes or market cap or capweighted indexes weight their securities by market value as measured by capitalization that is, current security price  outstanding shares. The vast majority of equity indexes today are capweighted, including the SP 500 and the FTSE 100. In a capweighted index, changes in the market value of larger securities move the indexs overall trajectory more than those of smaller ones. If the fund you are referencing is an ETF then there may be some work to do to figure out what underlying securities to use when handling Creation and Redemption units as an ETF will generally have shares created in 50,000 shares at a time through Authorized Participants. If the fund you are referencing is an openend fund then there is still cash flows to manage in the fund as the fund has create and redeem shares in on a daily basis. Note in both cases that there can be updates to an index such as quarterly rebalancing of outstanding share counts, changes in members because of mergers, acquisitions or spinoffs and possibly a few other factors. How to Beat the Benchmark has a piece that may also be useful here for those indices with many members from 1998 As you can see, its TE is also persistently positive, but if anything seems to be declining over time. In fact, the average net TE for the whole period is 0.155 per month, or an astounding 1.88 pa net after expenses. The fund expense ratio is 0.61 annually, for a whopping before expense TE of 2.5 annually. This is once again highly statistically significant, with p values of 0.015 after expenses and 0.0022 before expenses. The SD of the TE is higher for DFSCX than for NAESX, lowering its degree of statistical significance. It is remarkable enough for any fund to beat its benchmark by 2.5 annually over 17 years, but it is downright eerie to see this done by an index fund. To complete the picture, since 1992 the Vanguard Extended Index Fund has beaten its benchmark the Wilshire 4500 by 0.56 per year after expenses 0.81 net of expenses, and even the Vanguard Index Trust 500 has beaten its benchmark by a razor thin 0.08 annually before but not after expenses in the same period. So what is going on here? A hint is found in DFAs 1996 Reference Guide The 910 Portfolio captures the return behavior of U.S. small company stocks as identified by Rolf Banz and other academic researchers. Dimensional employs a ""patient buyer"" discount block trading strategy which has resulted in negative total trading costs, despite the poor liquidity of small company stocks. Beginning in 1982, Ibbotson Associates of Chicago has used the 910 Portfolio results to calculate the performance of small company stocks for their Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation yearbook. A small cap index fund cannot possibly own all of the thousands of stocks in its benchmark instead it owns a ""representative sample."" Further, these stocks are usually thinly traded, with wide bidask spreads. In essence what the folks at DFA learned was that they could tell the market makers in these stocks, ""Look old chaps, we dont have to own your stock, and unless you let us inside your spread, well pitch our tents elsewhere. Further, were prepared to wait until a motivated seller wishes to unload a large block."" In a sense, this gives the fund the luxury of picking and choosing stocks at prices more favorable than generally available. Hence, higher long term returns. It appears that Vanguard did not tumble onto this until a decade later, but tumble they did. To complete the picture, this strategy works best in the thinnest markets, so the excess returns are greatest in the smallest stocks, which is why the positive TE is greatest for the DFA 910 Fund, less in the Vanguard Small Cap Fund, less still in the Vanguard Index Extended Fund, and minuscule with the SP500. There are some who say the biggest joke in the world of finance is the idea of value added active management. If so, then the punch line seems to be this If you really want to beat the indexes, then you gotta buy an index fund.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What exactly do fund managers of index trackers do?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why are American Express cards are not as popular as Visa or MasterCard?,"My experience is in the United States only. In the past, American Express marketed its products as more exclusive and prestigious than other cards. There was an attempt to give the impression that cardholders were more qualified financially. In return, fees were higher both to merchants and to cardholders. At the time early 1990s, it was not common to use credit cards for small purchases, such as groceries or fast food. Credit cards were used for larger purchases such as jewelry or electronics or dinner in a nicer restaurant. Once it became popular to use credit cards for everyday purchases, the demand for customers using credit cards changed to the highest number of people instead of people of higher status. At that point, Visa and to a lesser extent Mastercard transaction volume increased dramatically. Merchants needed the largest number of customers with cards, not the most financially stable. As Visa volume grew, and people started using Visa for small purchases, the use of American Express decreased as their habits changed once someone got used to pulling out Visa, they did it in every situation. Merchants are less willing to go through the extra hassle of accepting cards that are used by fewer people. Over time, I suspect this process led to the gap between Visa and American Express. As a merchant, in order to accept credit cards, you have to set up a bank account and maintain a merchant account. Accepting Visa, MC and Discover can all be done through one account, but American Express has traditionally required a separate relationship, as well as its own set of rules and fees that were generally higher. Since there are relatively few American Express cardholders compared to Visa, there is doubt about whether it is worth it accept the card. It depends upon the customer base. Fine restaurants still generally accept American Express.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why are American Express cards are not as popular as Visa or MasterCard?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Project future trend of a stock with high positive autocorrelation,"Autocorrelation is a statistical concept for measuring repeating patterns in series. In stocks it is of particular interest as if future prices can be reliably guessed from past prices a lot of money could be made. Note, even in cases where autocorrelations are high and persistent near 1 there is still some possibility that the next time period would be down even if the previous period was up. Now the important part here is that high and persistent autocorrelation also means once the price falls the next period the price is also more likely to fall! Once one period was down the next period is more likely to be down so the price does not need to go to infinity. Instead, it generally would display up and down trends. Now, the key word above for investing is persistence. For stocks, autocorrelations are, at best, weakly persistent at reasonable time scales. So, even if a stock was highly autocorrelated during a previous period it is tough to make consistent money off of trading on these past trending patterns.

Why do gas stations charge different amounts in the same local area?,"This is known as ""Zone Pricing"" or ""Geographical Pricing"". httparticles.latimes.com2005jun19businessficalprice19 Such price variations may seem odd, but they are not unique to Anaheim. On any given day, in any major U.S. city, a single brand of gasoline will sell for a wide range of prices even when the cost to make and deliver the fuel is the same. The primary culprit is zone pricing, a secret and pervasive oil company strategy to boost profits by charging dealers different amounts for fuel based on traffic volume, station amenities, nearby household incomes, the strength of competitors and other factors. Its a controversial strategy, but the courts have thus far deemed it legal, and the Federal Trade Commission recently said the effect on consumers was ambiguous because some customers got hurt by higher prices while others benefited from lower ones. httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGeographicalpricing Zone pricing, as practiced in the gasoline industry in the United States, is the pricing of gasoline based on a complex and secret weighting of factors, such as the number of competing stations, number of vehicles, average traffic flow, population density, and geographic characteristics. This can result in two branded gas stations only a few miles apart selling gasoline at a price differential of as much as 0.50 per gallon. But the short answer is ""because they can"". Its legal, provided that some people are paying less while others are paying more. Essentially the larger, richer audience is subsidizing the product for other areas.

Capital gains, interest, and return of capital are other kinds of cash that can be distributed. While cash is cash, the nature of each varies for tax purposes and so they are classified differently.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How do you determine the dividend payout date for Mutual Funds?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

How much power does a CEO have over a public company?,"This is a very good question and is at the core of corporate governance. The CEO is a very powerful figure indeed. But always remember that he heads the firms management only. He is appointed by the board of directors and is accountable to them. The board on the other hand is accountable to the firms shareholders and creditors. The CEO is required to disclose his ownership of the firm as well. Ideally, you as a shareholder would want the board of directors to be as independent of the management as it is possible. U.S. regulations require, among other things, the board of directors to disclose any material relationship they may have with the firms employees, exemployees, or their families. Such disclosures can be found in annual filings of a company. If the board of directors acts independently of the management then it acts to protect the shareholders interests over the firm managements interest and take seemingly hard decisions like dismissing a CEO when they become necessary to protect the franchise and shareholder wealth.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How much power does a CEO have over a public company?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

401K  shift from agressive investment to Money Market,"If you look at history, it shows that the more people predict corrections the less was the chance they came. That doesnt prove it stays so, though. 2017 is not any different than other years in the future Independent of this, with less than ten years remaining until you need to draw from your money, it is a good idea to move away from high risk and high gain you will not have enough time to recover if it goes awry. There are different approaches, but you should slowly and continuously migrate your capital to less risky investments. Pick some good days and move 10 or 20 each time to lowrisk, so that towards the end of the remaining time 90 or 100 are low or zero risk investments.

Importance of dividend yield when evaluating a stock?,"But I wish to know why the parameter is dividendmarket price rather than just dividend? What extra info you can uncover by looking at dividendmarket price that you cannot get from dividend? Consider two stocks A and B. A offers a dividend of 1 per year. B offers a dividend of 2 per year. Lets remove all complications aside and assume that this trend continues. If you were to buy each of these stocks you will get the following amounts over its life assumed infinity for simplicity cash flows from A  10.04  25, assuming risk free is 4 per annum cash flows from B  20.04  50, assuming risk free is 4 per annum The price you buy them at is an important factor to consider because lets say if A was trading for 10 and B for 60, then A would look like a profitable nvestment while B wont. Of course, this is a very simplistic view. Dividend rates are not constant and many companies pose a significant risk of going bust but this should help illustrate the general idea behind the DP ratio. P.S.

Why do people sell when demand pushes share price up?,"If the price has gone up from what it was when the person bought, he may sell to collect his profit and spend the money. If someone intends to keep his money in the market, the trick is that you dont know when the price of a given stock will peak. If you could tell the future, sure, youd buy when the stock was at its lowest point, just before it started up, and then sell at the highest point, just before it started down. But no one knows for sure what those points are. If a stockholder really KNOWS that demand is increasing and the price WILL go up, sure, it would be foolish to sell. But you can never KNOW that.

Is there any reason not to buy points when refinancing with intent not to sell for a while?,"There is the opportunity cost. Lets say it cost you 1000 to buy 0.25 discount. Over N number of years that saves you lets say 2000 thus your profit is 1000. What if you took that 1000 and invested it? Would you have more than 2000 after N number of years? Obviously answering this question is not easy but you can make some educated guesses. For example, you can compare the return youll likely get from investing in CD or treasury bond. A bit more risky is to invest in the stock market but an index fund should be fairly safe and you can easily find the average return over 5  10 year period. For example, if your loan is 200,000 at 0.25 per year youll get 500 in savings. Over 10 years thats 5000  1000 to buy the point, you end up with 4000. Using the calculator on this site, I calculated that if you invested in the Dow Jones industrial average between 2007 and 2017 you total return would have been 111 assuming dividends are reinvested or you wouldve had a total of 2110.

Get interest on 100K by spending only 2K using FOREX rollovers?,"No free lunch You cannot receive riskfree interest on more money than you actually put down. The construct you are proposing is called Carry Trade, and will yield you the interestdifference in exchange for assuming currency risk. Negative expectation In the long run one would expect the higheryielding currency to devalue faster, at a rate that exactly negates the difference in interest. Net profit is therefore zero in the long run. Now factor in the premium that a forex broker charges, and now you may expect losses the size of which depends on the leverage chosen. If there was any way that this could reliably produce a profit even without friction i.e. rollover, transaction costs, spread, quants would have already arbitraged it away.

Is investing into real estate a good move for a riskaverse person at the moment,"Its always a good move for riskaverse person, expecially in Europe. Because houses are not represented by number in an index. Therefor if you are riskadverse, you will suffer less pain when house prices go down because you wont have a number to look at everyday like the SP500 index. Because houses in Europe Germany, Italy, Spain are almost all made by concrete and really well done string real marble cover, hard ceramic covers, copper pipes, ... compared to the ones in US. The house will still be almost new after 30 years, it will just need a repaint and really fewcheap fixings. Because on the long run 2030 years hosues are guaranteed to rise in price, expecially in dense places like big city, NY, San Francisco, etc. The reason is simple the number of people is ever growing in this world, but the quantity of land is always the same. Moreover there is inflation, do you really think that 30 years from now building a concrete house will be less expensive than today??? Do you think the concrete will cost less? Do you think the gasoline that moves the trucks that bring the concrete will be less expensive than now? Do you think the labour cost will be less expensice than now? So, 30 years from now building an house will be much more expensive than today, and therefor your house wil be more expensive too. On the lomng run stock market do not guarantee you to always increase. The US stock market have always been growing in the long run, but Japan stock market today is at the same level of 30 years ago.

"Should Emergency Funds be Used for Infrequent, but Likely, Expenses?","For me, the emergency fund is meant to cover unexpected, but necessary expenses that I didnt budget for. The emergency fund allows me to pay for these things without going into debt. Lets say that my car breaks down, and I dont have any money in my budget for fixing it. I really need to get my car fixed, so I spend the money from my emergency fund. However, cars break down periodically. If I was doing a better job with my budget, I would allocate some money each month into a ""car repairmaintenance"" category. In fact, I actually do this. With my budgeting software, I can look at how much Ive spent on car repairs over the last year, and budget a monthly amount for car repair expenses. Even if I do this, I might end up short if I am unlucky. Emergency fund to the rescue! If Im budgeting correctly, I dont pay any regular bills out of this fund, as those are expected expenses. Car insurance, life insurance, and property tax are all bills that come on a regular basis, and I set aside money for each of these each month so that when the bill comes, I have the money ready to go. The recommended size of an emergency fund is usually listed as ""3 to 6 months of expenses."" However, that is just a rough guideline. As you get better with your budget, you might find that you have a lower probability of needing it, and you can let your emergency fund fall to the lower end of the guideline range. The size of my own emergency fund is on the lower end of this scale. And if I have a true crisis i.e. extended unemployment, severe family medical event, I can ""rob"" one of my other savings funds, such as my car replacement fund, vacation fund, etc. Dont be afraid to spend your emergency fund money if you need it. If you have an unexpected, necessary expense that you have not budgeted for, use the emergency fund money. However, your goal should be to get to the point where you never have to use it, because you have adequately accounted for all of the expenses that you can reasonably expect to have in the future.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Should Emergency Funds be Used for Infrequent, but Likely, Expenses?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is the rationale behind stock markets retreating due to SP having a negative outlook on the USA?,"If you spoke in front of a group of people in 2001 about the possibility of be lowered, you would be written off as a kook. Now SP is talking about a negative credit outlook  scary stuff. Its scary because a base assumption in any risk model is that US Treasury debt is utterly reliable and comes with zero default risk. So publicly banding about the notion that US Treasury debt may be less the AAA in two years is a shock to the system and changes the way many people assess risk. Its also scary because Treasury debt is auctioned... will a spooked market still accept a measely 2.9 return for a 7 year TBill? But while the prospect of a credit downgrade is truly a bad thing, you also need to take the SP statements with a grain of salt  since being a named a villain during the mortgage implosion these were the guys who declared junk mortgage securities as AAA, they now err on the side of doom and gloom.

How can I compare the risk of different investing opportunities?,"First of all, setting some basics What is a sound way to measure the risk of each investment in order to compare them with each other ? There is no single way that can be used across all asset classes  risks. Generally speaking, you want to perform both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of risks that you identify. Quantitative risk assessment may involve historical data andor parametric or nonparametric models. Using historical data is often simple but may be hard in cases where the amount of data you have on a given event is low e.g. risk of bust by investing in a cryptocurrency. Parametric and nonparametric risk quantification models exist e.g. Value at Risk VaR, Expected Shortfall ES, etc and abound but a lot of them are more complicated than necessary for an individuals requirements. Qualitative risk assessment is ""simply"" assessing the likelihood and severity of risks by using intuition, expert judgment where that applies, etc. One may consult with outside parties e.g. lawyers, accountants, bankers, etc where their advisory may help highlighting some risks or understanding them better. To ease comparing investment opportunities, you may want to perform a risk assessment on categories of risks e.g. investing in the stock market vs bond market. To compare between those categories, one should look at the whole picture quantitative and qualitative with their risk appetite in mind. Of course, after taking those macro decisions, you would need to further assess risks on more micro decisions e.g. Microsoft or Google ?. You would then most likely end up with better comparatives as you would be comparing items similar in nature. Should I always consider the worst case scenario ? Because when I do that, I always can lose everything. Generally speaking, you want to consider everything so that you can perform a risk assessment and decide on your risk mitigating strategy see Q4. By assessing the likelihood and severity of risks you may find that even in cases where you are comparatively as worseoff e.g. in case of complete bust, the likelihood may differ. For example, keeping gold in a personal stash at home vs your employer going bankrupt if you are working for a large firm. Do note that you want to compare risks both likelihood and severity after any risk mitigation strategy you may want to put in place e.g. maybe putting your gold in a safety box in a secure bank would make the likelihood of losing your gold essentially null. Is there a way to estimate the probability of such events, better than intuition ? Estimating probability or likelihood is largely dependent on data on hand and your capacity to model events. For most practical purposes of an individual, modelling would be way off in terms of rewardbenefits. You may therefore want to simply research on past events and assign them a 15 1 being very low, 5 being very high risk rating based on your assessment of the likelihood. For example, you may assign a 1 on your employer going bankrupt and a 2 or 3 on being burglarized. This is only slightly better than intuition but has the merit of being based on data e.g. frequency of burglary in your neighborhood. Should I only consider more probable outcomes and have a plan for them if they occur? This depends largely on your risk appetite. The more risk averse you are, the more thorough you will want to be in identifying, tracking and mitigating risks. For the risks that you have identified as relevant, or of concern, you may opt to establish a risk mitigating strategy, which is conventionally one of accepting, sharing by taking insurance, for example, avoiding and reducing. It may not be possible to share or reduce some risks, especially for individuals, and so often the response will be either to accept or avoid the given risks by opting in or out on an opportunity.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How can I compare the risk of different investing opportunities?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

They also could have sold shares of stock to lock in gains, or to get out of positions they no longer wanted.

"For how long is a draft check valid, and where do the funds sit?","To answer length validity and security implications of draft checks issued and negotiated within the United States, I am heavily addressing the common erroneous assumptions of where the funds sit while theyre ""in"" a draft check and how to get them out. TlDr The existing answers are incomplete and in some ways dangerously misleading. Jerry can still be potentially defrauded by Tom, and even if the check is legitimately drawn and negotiable, Jerry may still experience delayed access to the funds. The funds sit in an account held by the issuing bank. As long as the bank has sufficient funds, the check does. However, there are significantly more factors that go into whether a check will be returned unpaid ""bounce"". If I hand you 5000 in cash, will you give me 5000 in cash? Probably, and youd probably be pretty safe. How about I give you a 5000 draft check, will you give me 5000 in cash without doing anything except looking at it to verify the check? I hope not Cash America sure wouldnt but people sell expensive goods with the ""same as cash"" attitude. Remember The only noncash form of payment which cannot somehow be held, reversed or returned unpaid in the U.S. without consent of the receiving party is a payment order a.k.a wire transfer! The draft check is ""as good as cash"" in the sense that the money for a draft check is withdrawn from your account before the check is negotiated deposited. This does NOT mean that a draft check will not bounce, so Jerry is NOT as secure in handing the goods to Tom as if Tom had handed him cash, as it is still a check. Jerrys bank will not receive the funds for Toms draft check for an average 3 to 5 business days, same as a personal check. Jerry will probably have access to the first 5000 within two business days... provided that he deposits the draft check in person at his banks branch or in a bankowned ATM. In the United States, Regulation CC governs funds availability. Regarding official, draft, or tellers checks ""If the customer desires nextday availability of funds from these checks, [your bank] may require use of a special deposit slip."" Mobile deposit availability in the U.S. is NOT regulated in this way and will likely be subject to a longer hold on more, if not all, of the check! Draft checks, dont, as a habit, ""bounce"" in the colloquial sense of ""returned for insufficient funds."" This is because they are prepaid and drawn upon a financial institutions account. Banks are insolvent far less frequently than other businesses or individuals. Draft checks, tellers checks, official checks, bank checks, etc CAN, however, be returned unpaid if one of the following is true As an aside an institution is not obligated to honor a stale dated check, but may do so at its discretion. If you have a personal check outstanding for over 6 months, it may still clear and potentially overdraw your account. In this case, contact your bank ASAP to process a reversal. The depositing bank misscans the check and the issuing bank refuses the resulting data. I have seen systems misread which data field is which, or its contents. Also, there is the possibility the image if the check will be illegible to the issuing bank. The draft check has been cancelled stop paid. This can happen if a The check was fraudulently bought from the issuing bank using Toms account b Tom has completed an indemnification agreement that the check was lost or otherwise not used for its intended purpose, without fraud having occurred against Tom c The draft check is escheated paid to the state as unclaimed property. This case is a subset of case 1, but will lead to a different return reason stamped on the image replacement document of the check. The draft check was never any good in the first place. Because of the perception that draft checks are as good as cash theyre not but are a lot better than personal checks, forgery and attempted fraud is shockingly common. These arent actually underwritten by a real bank, even if they appear to be. The only money ""in"" them is what the fraudster can get out of you. Jerry did not properly endorse the check before presenting it for deposit or otherwise negotiating it. In my time in banking, I most commonly saw cases 3 and 4. Unlike most counterfeit cash, case 3 will fool Jerry and Jerrys teller. Tom gets an immediate payout a car, a wire transfer, a payday loan, etc and Jerrys bank doesnt know the check isnt valid until they call the alleged issuing bank to verify its negotiability, or in the case of smaller checks into lowerrisk accounts, it is simply returned unpaid as fraudulently drawn. To conclude Call the alleged issuing banks verification line before handing over the goods, always properly endorse your deposits, and address what happens if one does not receive or collect on prompt payment in your contracts.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: For how long is a draft check valid, and where do the funds sit?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Other than being able to borrow to invest, how is a margin trading account different from a cash account?","Probably the most significant difference is the Damocles Sword hanging over your head, the Margin Call. In a nutshell, the lender your broker is going to require you to have a certain amount of assets in your account relative to your outstanding loan balance. The minimum ratio of liquid funds in the account to the loan is regulated in the US at 50 for the initial margin and 25 for maintenance margins. So heres where it gets sticky. If this ratio gets on the wrong side of the limits, the broker will force you to either add more assetscash to your account t or immediately liquidate some of your holdings to remedy the situation. Assuming you dont have anyenough cash to fix the problem it can effectively force you to sell while your investments are in the tank and lock in a big loss. In fact, most margin agreements give the brokerage the right to sell your investments without your express consent in these situations. In this situation you might not even have the chance to pick which stock they sell. Source Investopedia article, ""The Dreaded Margin Call"" Heres an example from the article Lets say you purchase 20,000 worth of securities by borrowing 10,000 from your brokerage and paying 10,000 yourself. If the market value of the securities drops to 15,000, the equity in your account falls to 5,000 15,000  10,000  5,000. Assuming a maintenance requirement of 25, you must have 3,750 in equity in your account 25 of 15,000  3,750. Thus, youre fine in this situation as the 5,000 worth of equity in your account is greater than the maintenance margin of 3,750. But lets assume the maintenance requirement of your brokerage is 40 instead of 25. In this case, your equity of 5,000 is less than the maintenance margin of 6,000 40 of 15,000  6,000.

How does a high share price benefit a company when it is raising funds?,"In an IPO initial public offering or APO additional public offering situation, a small group of stakeholders as few as one basically decide to offer an additional number of ""shares"" of equity in the company. Usually, these ""shares"" are all equal if you own one share you own a percentage of the company equal to that of anyone else who owns one share. The sum total of all shares, theoretically, equals the entire value of the company, and so with N shares in existence, one share is equivalent to 1Nth the company, and entitles you to 1Nth of the profits of the company, and more importantly to some, gives you a vote in company matters which carries a weight of 1Nth of the entire shareholder body. Now, not all of these shares are public. Most companies have the majority 51 of shares owned by a small number of ""controlling interests"". These entities, usually founding owners or their families, may be prohibited by agreement from selling their shares on the open market other controlling interests have right of first refusal. For ""private"" companies, ALL the shares are divided this way. For ""public"" companies, the remainder is available on the open market, and those shares can be bought and sold without involvement by the company. Buyers cant buy more shares than are available on the entire market. Now, when a company wants to make more money, a high share price at the time of the issue is always good, for two reasons. First, the company only makes money on the initial sale of a share of stock once its in a third partys hands, any profit from further sale of the stock goes to the seller, not the company. So, it does little good to the company for its share price to soar a month after its issue the companys already made its money from selling the stock. If the company knew that its shares would be in higher demand in a month, it should have waited, because it could have raised the same amount of money by selling fewer shares. Second, the price of a stock is based on its demand in the market, and a key component of that is scarcity the fewer shares of a company that are available, the more theyll cost. When a company issues more stock, theres more shares available, so people can get all they want and the demand drops, taking the share price with it. When theres more shares, each share being a smaller percentage of the company earns less in dividends as well, which figures into several key metrics for determining whether to buy or sell stock, like earnings per share and priceearnings ratio. Now, you also asked about ""dilution"". Thats pretty straightforward. By adding more shares of stock to the overall pool, you increase that denominator each share becomes a smaller percentage of the company. The ""privatelyheld"" stocks are reduced in the same way. The problem with simply adding stocks to the open market, getting their initial purchase price, is that a larger overall percentage of the company is now on the open market, meaning the ""controlling interests"" have less control of their company. If at any time the majority of shares are not owned by the controlling interests, then even if they all agree to vote a certain way for instance, whether or not to merge assets with another company another entity could buy all the public shares or convince all existing public shareholders of their point of view and overrule them. There are various ways to avoid this. The most common is to issue multiple types of stock. Typically, ""common"" stock carries equal voting rights and equal shares of profits. ""Preferred stock"" typically trades a higher share of earnings for no voting rights. A company may therefore keep all the ""common"" stock in private hands and offer only preferred stock on the market. There are other ways to ""class"" stocks, most of which have a similar tradeoff between earnings percentage and voting percentage typically by balancing these two you normalize the price of stocks if one stock had better dividends and more voting weight than another, the other stock would be nearworthless, but companies may create and issue ""superstock"" to controlling interests to guarantee both profits and control. Youll never see a ""superstock"" on the open market where they exist, they are very closely held. But, if a company issues ""superstock"", the market will see that and the price of their publiclyavailable ""common stock"" will depreciate sharply. Another common way to increase market cap without diluting shares is simply to create more shares than you issue publicly the remainder goes to the current controlling interests. When Facebook solicited outside investment before it went public, thats basically what happened the original founders were issued additional shares to maintain controlling interests though not as significant, balancing the issue of new shares to the investors. The ""ideal"" form of this is a ""stock split"" the company simply multiplies the number of shares it has outstanding by X, and issues X1 additional shares to each current holder of one share. This effectively divides the price of one share by X, lowering the barrier to purchase a share and thus hopefully driving up demand for the shares overall by making it easier for the average Joe Investor to get their foot in the door. However, issuing shares to controlling interests increases the total number of shares available, decreasing the market value of public shares that much more and reducing the amount of money the company can make from the stock offering.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: How does a high share price benefit a company when it is raising funds?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"Buy tires and keep car for 1236 months, or replace car now? ","I dont see how anyone could give you a hardandfast formula, unless they know where to get some applicable statistics. Because several factors here are not a straight calculation. If you dont replace the tires but keeping driving the car, what is the increased probability that you will get into an accident because of the bald tires? How much will bald tires vs new tires affect the selling price of the car? Presumably the longer you drive the car after getting new tires, the less increase this will give to the market value of the car. Whats the formula for that? If you keep the car, whats the probability that it will have other maintenance problems? Etc. That said, its almost always cheaper to keep your current car than to buy a new one. Even if you have maintenance problems, it would have to be a huge problem to cost more than buying a new car. Suppose you buy a 25,000 car with ... whats a typical new car loan these days? maybe 5 years at 5? So your payments would be about 470 per month. If you compare spending 1000 for new tires versus paying 470 per month on a new car loan, the tires are cheaper within 3 months. The principle is the same if you buy with cash. To justify buying a new car you have to factor in the value of the pleasure you get from a new car, the peace of mind from having something more reliable, etc, mostly intangibles.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Buy tires and keep car for 1236 months, or replace car now?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Dispute credit card transaction with merchant or credit card company?,"Its very straightforward for an honest vendor to refund the charge, and the transaction only costs him a few pennies at most. If you initiate a chargeback, the merchant is immediately charged an irreversible fee of about 20 simply as an administrative fee. Hell also have to refund the charge if its reversed. To an honest merchant who wouldve happily refunded you, its unfair and hurtful. In any case, now that hes outofpocket on the administrative fee, his best bet is to fight the chargeback  since hes already paid for the privilege to fight. Also, a chargeback is a ""strike"" against the merchant. If his chargeback rate is higher than the norm in his industry, they may raise his fees, or ban him entirely from taking VisaMC. For a small merchant doing a small volume, a single chargeback can have an impact on his overall chargeback rate.

What is the pitfall of using the Smith maneuver,"The catch is that youre doing a form of leveraged investing. In other words, youre gambling on the stock market using money that youve borrowed. While its not as dangerous as say, getting money from a loan shark to play blackjack in Vegas, there is always the chance that markets can collapse and your investments value will drop rapidly. The amount of risk really depends on what specific investments you choose and how diversified they are  if you buy only Canadian stocks then youre at risk of losing a lot if something happened to our economy. But if your Canadian equities only amount to 3.6 of your total which is Canadas share of the world market, and youre holding stocks in many different countries then the diversification will reduce your overall risk. The reason I mention that is because many people using the Smith Maneuver are only buying Canadian highyield dividend stocks, so that they can use the dividends to accelerate the Smith Maneuver process use the dividends to pay down the mortgage, then borrow more and invest it. They prefer Canadian equities because of preferential tax treatment of the dividend income in nonregistered accounts. But if something happened to those Canadian companies, they stand to lose much of the investment value and suddenly they have the extra debt the amount borrowed from a HELOC, or from a readvanceable mortgage without enough value in the investments to offset it.

Why does it take 3 days to do electronic transfers between banks? [duplicate],"I was perplexed by this until a few days ago when it finally clicked in a meeting with our fraud and money laundering teams in work I work on trading surveillance. Apparently fraud detection and prevention of money laundering are currently the biggest delayers when it comes to electronic transfer of funds, checking that the transferring party has the funds to transfer etc. takes no time at all. It takes some time for a bank user to ""release"" a funds transfer once it has been initiated it is put into a queue to be reviewed as potentially fraudulent or money laundering activity. Almost every transaction has to be monitored for this from a legal standpoint. The compliance process can take multiple days. Once the process is complete the request also has to go through ""settling"" which is an end of day process whereby banks ""net off"" their customers transactions with other banks and only pass the net value between them. This is an end of day process by nature so only happens once a day meaning that once all of the checks have occurred any transaction will take until the end of the day to crystallise for the bank and so get credited to their customers accounts. Incidentally in the UK and Europe banks are moving to streamline this process through ""faster payment"" systems that is the industry term for the technology so that customers see the effect within a few hours 2 in the UK currently and then the banks net off at the end of day as usual. This means reducing the time it takes to do the checks that have to be done using specialist software to flag transfers as potentially fraudulent or not and making banks processes much clearer and faster.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why does it take 3 days to do electronic transfers between banks?

2 401ks and a SEPIRA,"Please note that if you are self employed, then the profit sharing limit for both the SEP and Solo 401k is 20 of compensation, not 25. There is no need for a SEPIRA in this case. In addition to the 401k at work, you have a solo401k for your consulting business. You can contribute 18,000 on the employee side across the two 401k plans however you wish. You can also contribute profit sharing up to 20 of compensation in your solo 401k plan. However, the profit sharing limit aggregates across all plans for your consulting business. If you max that out in your solo 401k, then you cannot contribute to the SEP IRA. In other words, the solo 401k dominates the SEP IRA in terms of contributions and shares a limit on the profitsharing contribution.

"One of my stocks dropped 40 in 2 days, how should I mentally approach this?","First do you understand why it dropped? Was it overvalued before, or is this an overreaction to some piece of news about them, or about their industry, or...? Arguably, if you cant answer that, you arent paying enough attention to have been betting on that individual stock. Assuming you do understand why this price swing occurred  or if youre convinced you know better than the folks who sold at that price  do you believe the stock will recover a significant part of its value any time soon, or at least show a nice rate of growth from where it is now? If so, you might want to hold onto it, risking further losses against the chance of recovering part or all of what is  at this moment  only a loss on paper. Basically if, having just seen it drop, youd still consider buying it at the new price you should ""buy it from yourself"" and go on from here. That way at least you arent doing exactly what you hope to avoid, buying high and selling low. Heck, if you really believe in the stock, you could see this as a buying opportunity... On the other hand, if you do not believe you would buy it now at its new price, and if you see an alternative which will grow more rapidly, you should take your losses and move your money to that other stock. Or split the difference if you arent sure which is better but can figure out approximately how unsure you are. The question is how you move on from here, more than how you got here. What happened happened. What do you think will happen next, and how much are you willing to bet on it? On the gripping hand This is part of how the market operates. Risk and potential reward tend to be pretty closely tied to each other. You can reduce risk by diversifying across multiple investments so no one companysectormarket can hurt you too badly  and almost anyone sane will tell you that you should diversify  but that means giving up some of the chance for big winnings too. You probably want to be cautious with most of your money and go for the longer odds only with a small portion that you can afford to lose on. If this is really stressing you out, you may not want to play with individual stocks. Mutual funds have some volatility too, but theyre inherently diversified to a greater or lesser extent.

How to motivate young people to save money ,"Are you sure the question even makes sense? In the presentday world economy, its unlikely that someone young who just started working has the means to put away any significant amount of money as savings, and attempting to do so might actually preclude making the financial choices that actually lead to stability  things like purchasing [the right types and amounts of] insurance, buying outright rather than using credit to compensate for the fact that you committed to keep some portion of your income as savings, spending money in ways that enrich your experience and expand your professional opportunities, etc. Theres also the ethical question of how viablesustainable saving is. The mechanism by which saving ensures financial stability is by everyone hoarding enough resources to deal with some level of worstcase scenario that might happen in their future. This worked for past generations in the US because we had massive amounts relative to the population of stolen natural resources, infrastructure built on enslaved labor, etc. It doesnt scale with modern changes the world is undergoing and it inherently only works for some people when its not working for others.

"What is the best asset allocation for a retirement portfolio, and why?","Aggressiveness in a retirement portfolio is usually a function of your age and your risk tolerance. Your portfolio is usually a mix of the following asset classes You can break down these asset classes further, but each one is a topic unto itself. If you are young, you want to invest in things that have a higher return, but are more volatile, because market fluctuations like the current financial meltdown will be long gone before you reach retirement age. This means that at a younger age, you should be investing more in stocks and foreigndeveloping countries. If you are older, you need to be into more conservative investments bonds, money market, etc. If you were in your 50s60s and still heavily invested in stock, something like the current financial crisis could have ruined your retirement plans. A lot of baby boomers learned this the hard way. For most of your life, you will probably be somewhere in between these two. Start aggressive, and gradually get more conservative as you get older. You will probably need to recheck your asset allocation once every 5 years or so. As for how much of each investment class, there are no hard and fast rules. The idea is to maximize return while accepting a certain amount of risk. There are two big unknowns in there 1 how much return do you expect from the various investments, and 2 how much risk are you willing to accept. 1 is a big guess, and 2 is personal opinion. A general portfolio guideline is ""100 minus your age"". This means if you are 20, you should have 80 of your retirement portfolio in stocks. If you are 60, your retirement portfolio should be 40 stock. Over the years, the ""100"" number has varied. Some financial advisor types have suggested ""150"" or ""200"". Unfortunately, thats why a lot of baby boomers cant retire now. Above all, rebalance your portfolio regularly. At least once a year, perhaps quarterly if the market is going wild. Make sure you are still inline with your desired asset allocation. If the stock market tanks and you are underinvested in stocks, buy more stock, selling off other funds if necessary. Ive read interviews with fund managers who say failure to rebalance in a down stock market is one of the big mistakes people make when managing a retirement portfolio. As for specific mutual fund suggestions, Im not going to do that, because it depends on what your 401k or IRA has available as investment options. I do suggest that your focus on selecting a ""passive"" index fund, not an actively managed fund with a high expense ratio. Personally, I like ""total market"" funds to give you the broadest allocation of small and big companies. This makes your question about largesmall cap stocks moot. The next best choice would be an SP 500 index fund. You should also be able to find a lowcost Bond Index Fund that will give you a healthy mix of different bond types. However, you need to look at expense ratios to make an informed decision. A betterperforming fund is pointless if you lose it all to fees! Also, watch out for overlap between your fund choices. Investing in both a Total Market fund, and an SP 500 fund undermines the idea of a diversified portfolio. An aggressive portfolio usually includes some ForeignDeveloping Nation investments. There arent many index fund options here, so you may have to go with an activelymanaged fund with a much higher expense ratio. However, this kind of investment can be worth it to take advantage of the economic growth in places like China. httpwww.getrichslowly.orgblog20090427howtocreateyourowntargetdatemutualfund","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is the best asset allocation for a retirement portfolio, and why?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why are earning credit card rewards often tied to groceries and gas?,"There absolutely is a specific model that makes this so popular with so many credit card companies, and that model is ""per transaction fees"". Card companies also receive costsharing incentives from certain merchants. There is also a psychological reasoning as an additional incentive. When you want to accept credit cards as a source of payment as a business, you generally have three kinds of fees to pay monthlyyearly subscription fees, percentage of transaction fee, and per transaction fee. The subscription fees can be waived and sometimes are expressed as a ""minimum cost"", so the business pays a certain amount whether you actually have people use credit cards or not. Many of these fees dont actually make it to the credit card companies, as they just pay the service providers and middlemen processing companies. The percentage of transaction fee means that the business accepting payment via credit card must pay a percentage usually ranging from 13 of the total transactions they accept. So if they get paid 10,000 a month by customers in the form of credit cards, the business pays out 100300 a month to the credit card processor  a good portion of which will make it back to the credit card issuing company, and is a major source of income for them. The per transaction fee means that every time a transaction is run involving a card, a set fee is incurred by the business which is commonly anywhere from 0.05 to 0.30 per transaction. If that 10,000 a month business mentioned previously had 10 customers paying 1,000 each at 0.10 a transaction, thats only 1 in fees to the credit card processorscompanies. But if instead that business was a grocery store with an average transaction of 40, thats 25 in fees. This system means that if you are a credit card company and want to encourage people to make a specific kind of purchase, you should encourage purchases that people make many times for relatively small amounts of money. In a perfect world youd want them to buy 1 bottles of water 5 times a day with their credit card. If the card company had 50,000 card holders doing this, at the end of 1 year the company would have 91,250,000 spread across 91,250,000 transactions. The card company might reasonably make 0.05 per transaction and 1 of the purchase total. The Get Rewarded For Drinking More campaign might earn the card company 912,500 in percentage fees and over 4.5 million in transaction fees. Yet the company would only have to pay 3 in rewards from the percentage fees, or 2.7 million, back to customers. If the card company had encouraged using your credit card for large onceyearly purchases, they would actually pay out more money in rewards than they collect in carduse fees. Yet by encouraging people to make small transactions very often the card company earns a nice netincome even if absolutely every customer pays their balance in full, on time, and pays no annualmonthly fees for their card  which obviously does not happen in the real world. No wonder companies try so hard to encourage you to use your card all the time! For card companies to make real money they need you to use your credit card. As discussed above, the more often you use the card the better for them, and there can be a builtin preference for small repeated transactions. But no matter what the size of transaction, they cant make the big bucks if you dont use the card at all! Selling your personal information isnt as profitable if they dont have indepth info on you to sell, either. So how do they get you to make that plastic sing? Gas and groceries are a habit. Most people buy one or the other at least once a weak, and a very large number of us make such purchases multiple times a week. Some people even make such purchases multiple times a day! So how do people pay for such transactions? The goal of the card companies is to have you use their product to pay as much as possible. If you pay for something regularly youll keep that card in your wallet with you, rather than it getting lost in a drawer at home. So the card companies want you to use your card as a matter of habit, too. If you use a card to buy for gas and groceries, why wouldnt you use it for other things too? Lunch, dinner, buying online? If the card company pays out more and makes less for large, lessregular purchases, then the ideal for them is to have you use the card for small regular purchase and yet still have you use the card for larger infrequent purchases even if you get reducedno rewards. What better way to achieve all these goals than to offer special rewards on gas and groceries? And because its not a onetime purchase, you arent so likely to game the system no getting that special 5 cashback card, booking your onceperdecade dream vacation, then paying it off and cancelling it soon after  which would actually make the card company lose money on the deal. In the end, credit card companies as a whole have a business model that almost universally prefers customers who use their products regularly and preferably for small amounts a maximum number of times. They want to reduce their expenses like rewards paid out while maximizing their revenue. They havent figured out a better way to do all of this so well as to encourage people to use their cards for gas and groceries  everything else seems like a losing proposition in comparison. The only time this preference differs is when they can avoid paying some or all of the cost of rewards, such as when the merchants themselves honor the rewards in exchange for reduced or zero payment from the card companies. So if you use an airline card that seems to give you 10 back in airline rewards? Well, thats probably a great deal for the card company if the airline provides that reward at their own expense to try to boost business. The card company keeps the transactionrelated fees and pays out almost nothing in rewards  the perfect offer for them! And this assumes no shenanigans like blackout periods, ""not valid with any other offers"" rewards like on cars where only a fool pays full MSRP and sometimes the rewards are tagged in this sort of way, like not valid on saleclearance items, etc, expiring rewards, the fact that they know not everyone uses their rewards, annual fees that are greater than the rewards youll actually be obtaining after accounting for all the other issues, etc. And credit card industries are known for their shenanigans!",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why are earning credit card rewards often tied to groceries and gas?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Am I considered in debt if I pay a mortgage?,"Yes, a mortgage is debt. Its unique in that you have a house which should be worth far more than the mortgage. After the mortgage crisis, many found their homes under water i.e. worth less than the mortgage. The word debt is a simple noun for money owed, it carries no judgement or negative connotation except when its used to buy short lived items with money one doesnt have.

I am moving to a new city. How do I plan and prepare  financially  for the move?,"Utilities and cost of living vary from city to city but maybe not that much. For basic planning purposes you can probably figure to spend as much as you are now, maybe a little more. And adjust as needed when you get there. And adjust if, for example, youre moving from a very low cost of living area or to a very high cost of living area. The cost of housing varies quite a bit from city to city, but you can do this research using Zillow, Craigslist, other places. Now, on to moving itself. The cost of moving can vary hugely depending on how much stuff you have and how much work you want to do. On the cheap end, you can rent a UHaul or one of those portable boxes that they plant outside your old house and move for you. Youll do all the packingloadingunloadingunpacking yourself but it saves quite a bit of money. My family and I moved from Seattle to California last year using one of those portable box places and it ended up costing us 1400 including 30 days of storage at the destination while we looked for a place. We have a 1000 sq foot place with some furniture but not a huge amount and did all the packingloading ourselves. If we had wanted full service where people come pack, load, unpack, etc, it could have been 23x that amount. And if we had more stuff, it could have been a lot more expensive too. Try not to acquire too much stuff as you just end up having to move it around and take care of it all! Your employer may cover moving expenses, ask about this when talking about job offers. Unreimbursed moving expenses are taxdeductible in the US even if you dont itemize. Since youre just starting out, your best bet is to overestimate how much you think things will cost, then adjust as you arrive and settle in for a few months.

What are the advantages of paying off a mortgage quickly?,"I used to think that paying off ahead of time made sense, but I no longer do, at least in most cases. The upside is that you can get a return on your money equal to the mortgage interest rate its less than that in the US, where mortgage interest is deductible, so its roughly the mortgage interest rate  1  your marginal income tax rate. There are a few downsides. The biggest is that cash is the most liquid asset you can have you can get at it with no restrictions. If you put that cash into your house, you are converting that into an asset with a lot of restrictions you cant get at it without fees, nor can you get at it if you dont have a job, which is when you would need it most. So, you are putting your money in a hardtogetat place for a small interest rate. I dont think it is worthwhile. edit One complication is PMI.

Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment?,"Of course credit cards are viewed as credit. If youre using money on a credit card, you are not directly paying for your transactions on goodsservices immediately this is the act of borrowing credit to pay for them. Debit cards, on the other hand, work where the funds are taken from an account immediately or subject to a small delay  but usually no more than 24 hours  depending on various factors. You should never miss credit card payments, as that will affect your credit rating. If you have unpaid money on your card this is debt  plain and simple. But to answer your question succinctly  yes, credit cards are a form of credit, as the name suggests. When you apply for a mortgage any unpaid credit debt is considered and would adversely affect you if you have such debts. The level to which it affects you depends on the amount of debt.

Im 23 and was given 50k. What should I do?,"Ill add 2 observations regarding current answers. Jack nailed it  a 401k match beats all. But choose the right flavor account. You are currently in the 15 bracket i.e. your marginal tax rate, the rate paid on the last taxed 100, and next taxed 100. You should focus on Roth. Roth 401k and if any company match, that goes into a traditional pretax 401k. But if they permit conversions to the Roth side, do it You have a long time before retirement to earn your way into the next tax bracket, 25. As your income rises, use the deductible IRA 401k to take out money pretax that would otherwise be taxed at 25. One day, youll be so far into the 25 bracket, youll benefit by 100 traditional. But why waste the opportunity to deposit to Roth money thats taxed at just 15? To clarify the above, this is the single rate table for 2015 For this discussion, I am talking taxable income, the line on the tax return designating this number. If that line is 37,450 or less, you are in the 15 bracket and I recommend Roth. Say its 40,000. In hindsight on should put 2,550 in a pretax account Traditional 401k or IRA to bring it down to the 37,450. In other words, try to keep the 15 bracket full, but not push into 25. Last, after enough raises, say you at 60,000 taxable. That, to me is ""far into the 25 bracket."" 20,000 or 13 of income into the 401k and IRA and youre still in the 25 bracket. One can plan to a point, and then use the IRA flavors to get it dead on in April of the following year. To Bens point regarding paying off the Student Loan faster  A 33K income for a single person, about to have the new expense of rent, is not a huge income. Ill concede that theres a sleep factor, the long tern benefit of being debt free, and wont argue the long term market return vs the rate on the loan.

Student loan payments and opportunity costs,"Staying with your numbers  a 7 long term return will have a tax of 15 todays long term cap gain tax resulting in a post tax of 5.95. On the other hand, even if the student loan interest remains deductible, its subject to phaseout and a really successful grad will quickly lose the deduction. Theres a similar debate regarding mortgage debt. When Ive commented on my 3.5 mortgage costing 2.5 post tax, theres no consensus agreeing that this loan should remain as long as possible in favor of investing in the market for its long term growth. And in this case the advantage is a full 3.45yr. While Ive made my decision, Bens points remain, the market return isnt guaranteed, while that monthly loan payment is fixed and due each month. In the big picture, Id prioritize to make deposits to the 401k up to the match, if offered, pay down any higher interest debt such as credit cards, build an emergency account, and then make extra payments to the student loan. Keep in mind, also  if buying a house is an important goal, the savings toward the downpayment might take priority.

Leasing a car I intend to buy,"I have a colleague who always leases cars first. Hes very well off, has piles of money in savings, owns a home, and the cherry on top, he could just write a check for the car.... He sees the lease as an insurance policy on the first couple of years of the cars life. If it gets in an accident or he finds something about it he doesnt like, he can give it back to the dealer at the end of the term with no hassle and move on to the next car. Some people value the fact that a lease is a rental. If youre leasing a luxury car or something you couldnt otherwise afford, no amount of mental gymnastics will turn this in to a good idea. Separately, you should never make a down payment on a lease. If the car is totaled early on, you will not recoupe the money you put down. The issue here is that while the numbers all work out the same between a lease and a purchase your situation is different. If the leased car is totaled, the bank gets its money back from an insurer. If that payment doesnt cover the value of the car, the GAP insurance will cover it. In either situation, if theres an excess remaining it will be returned to you. The issue is the excess may not fully replace your down payment. If you then went to lease another car you would need to come up with that down payment again because you couldnt just simply choose to lease a used car like you could in the case of a purchase. Additionally, GAP is generally included in a lease whether you want it or not. As far as Im concerned it doesnt make financial sense to mitigate the value of the GAP coverage once youve decided to live in a lease situation.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Leasing a car I intend to buy?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Can a custodian refuse prioryear IRAHSA deposit postmarked April 15?,"The ""must be postmarked"" language might be just from the old bank itself, not from the IRS. The language I see in Publication 969 only says ""You can make contributions to your HSA for 2014 until April 15, 2015.""

I contributed money to the HSA using my credit unions website, transferring money from my checking account into my HSA, as I was told to do. In January and February of the following year, I made more contributions this way, thinking that I was making them for the previous tax year. However, they never got coded correctly by the credit union, and I later found out that the credit union counted those as contributions for the current year. As a result, I was essentially denied the full contribution limit for that year, and had a bit of a paperwork nightmare.

Rules for Broker Behavior with Covered Calls,"Number 2 cannot occur. You can buy the call back and sell the stock, but the broker wont force that 2 choice. To trade options, you must have a margin account. No matter how high the stock goes, once ""in the money"" the option isnt going to rise faster, so your margin  is not an issue. And your example is a bit troublesome to me. Why would a 120 strike call spike to 22 with only a month left? Youve made the full 20 on the stock rise and given up any gain after that. Thats all. The call owner may exercise at any time. Edit jaydles is right, there are circumstances where an option price can increase faster than the stock price. Options pricing generally follows the BlackScholes model. Since the OP gave us the current stock price, option strike price, and time to expiration, and we know the risk free rate is 1, you can use the calculator to change volatility.

Value of credit score if you never plan to borrow again?,"Theres many concrete answers, but theres something circular about your question. The only thing I can think of is that phone service providers ask for credit report when you want to start a new account but I am sure that could be worked around if you just put down a cash deposit in some cases. So now the situation is flipped  you are relying on your phone companys credit! Who is to say they dont just walk away from their end of the deal now that you have paid in full? The amount of credit in this situation is conserved. You just have to eat the risk and rely on their credit, because you have no credit. It doesnt matter how much money you have  10 or 10000 can be extorted out of you equally well if you must always pay for future goods up front. You also cant use that money monthbymonth now, even in lowrisk investments. Although, they will do exactly that and keep the interest. And I challenge your assumption that you will never default. You are not a seraphic being. You live on planet earth. Ever had to pay 125,000 for a chemo treatment because you got a rare form of cancer? Well, you wont be able to default on your phone plan and pay for your drug or food, if you bankrupt yourself on the drug because your money is already gone.

Do I pay a zero  loan before another to clear both loans faster?,"While, from a moneysaving standpoint, the obviouslyright course of action is to make only the minimum payment on the 0 loan, there are potentially legal reasons to try to pay off a car loan early. With a mortgage, you are the legal owner of the property and any action by the lender beyond imposing fees e.g. foreclosure requires going through the proper legal channels. On the other hand, in most jurisdictions, you are not the legal owner of a car purchased on a loan, and a missed or even lost payment can result in repossession without the lender even having to go to court. So from a riskaversion standpoint, theres something to be said for getting rid of car loans as soon as you can.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Do I pay a zero  loan before another to clear both loans faster?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why would a tender offer be less than the market price?,"Rational shareholders wouldnt accept such an offer. The company making the offer is simply trying to get a deal with questionable  though not illegal  tactics. Your answer is actually in the link you provided.

The SECs tips for investors regarding minitender offers may be found on the SECs Web site at httpwww.sec.govinvestorpubsminitend.htm. Theres a lot more information at the SEC web page mentioned. One part Ill highlight from the SEC web page mentions another reason for a minitender Investors need to scrutinize minitender offers carefully. Some bidders make minitender offers at belowmarket prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.

Covered Call Writing  What affects the price of the options?,"Here are some things to consider if you want to employ a covered call strategy for consistent returns. The discussion also applies to written puts, as theyre functionally equivalent. Write covered calls only on fairly valued stock. If the stock is distinctly undervalued, just buy it. By writing the call, you cap the gains that it will achieve as the stock price gravitates to intrinsic value. If the stock is overvalued, sell it, or just stay away. As the owner of a covered call position, you have full exposure to the downside of the stock. The premium received is normally way too small to protect against much of a drop in price. The ideal candidate doesnt change in price much over the life of the position. Yes, this is low volatility, which brings low option premiums. As a seller you want high premiums. But this cant be judged in a vacuum. No matter how high the volatility in absolute terms, as a seller youre betting the market has overpriced volatility. If volatility is high, so premiums are fat, but the market is correct, then the very real risk of the stock dropping over the life of the position offsets the premium received. One thing to look at is current implied volatility for the atthemoney ATM, nearmonth call. Compare it to the twoyear historical volatility Morningstar has this conveniently displayed. Moving away from pure volatility, consider writing calls about three months out, just slightly out of the money. The premium is all time value, and the time value decay accelerates in the final few months. In theory, a series of onemonth options would be higher time value, but there are frictional costs, and no guarantee that todays ""good deal"" will be repeatable twelve time per year. When comparing various strikes and expirations, compare time value per day. To compare the same statistic across multiple companies, use time value per day as a percent of capital at risk. CaR is the price of the stock less the premium received. If you already own the stock, track it as if you just bought it for this strategy, so use the price on the day you wrote the call. Along with time value per day, compare the simple annualized percent return, again, on capital at risk, measuring the return if a the stock is called away, and b the stock remains unchanged. I usually concentrate more on the second scenario, as we get the capital gain on the stock regardless, without the option strategy. Ideally, you can also calculate the probability based on implied volatility of the stock achieving these price points by expiration. Measuring returns at many possible stock prices, you can develop an overall expected return. I wont go into further detail, as it seems outside the scope here. Finally, I usually target a minimum of 25 annualized if the stock remains unchanged. You can, of course, adjust this up or down depending on your risk tolerance. I consider this to be conservative.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Covered Call Writing  What affects the price of the options?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

In which country can I set up a small company so that I pay a lower rate of corporate tax? ,"Grass is always greener at the other side of the hill.

Should I overpay to end a fixedrate mortgage early? [duplicate],"I would strongly encourage you to either find specifically where in your written contract the handling of earlyover payments are defined and post it for us to help you, or that you go and visit a licensed real estate attorney. Even at a ridiculously high price of 850 pounds per hour for a top UK law firm and I suspect you can find a competent lawyer for 1020 of that amount, it would cost you less than a year of prepayment penalty to get professional advice on what to do with your mortgage. A certified public accountant CPA might be able to advise you, as well, if thats any easier for you to find. I have the sneaking suspicion that the company representatives are not being entirely forthcoming with you, thus the need for outside advice. Generally speaking, loans are given an interest rate per period such as yearly APR, and you pay a percentage the interest of the total amount of money you owe the principle. So if you owe 100,000 at 5 APR, you accrue 5,000 in interest that year. If you pay only the interest each year, youll pay 50,000 in interest over 10 years  but if you pay everything off in year 8, at a minimum youd have paid 10,000 less in interest assuming no prepayment penalties, which you have some of those. So paying off early does not change your APR or your principle amount paid, but it should drastically reduce the interest you pay. Amortization schedules dont change that  they just keep the payments even over the scheduled full life of the loan. Even with prepayment penalties, these are customarily billed at less than 6 months of interest at the rate you would have payed if you kept the loan, so if you are supposedly on the hook for more than that again I highly suspect something fishy is going on  in which case youd probably want legal representation to help you put a stop to it. In short, something is definitely and most certainly wrong if paying off a loan years in advance  even after taking into account prepayment penalties  costs you the same or more than paying the loan off over the full term, on schedule. This is highly abnormal, and frankly even in the US Id consider it scandalous if it were the case.

Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?,"Possibly, if you can get them at a discount. But not if you have to pay full price. Say theres a 1 million Jackpot for 1 tickets. The seller might sell 1.25 million of these tickets, to raise 1.25 million pay a winner 1 million, and keep 250,000. In this example, the socalled ""expected value"" of your 1 ticket is 1 million1.25 million tickets 80 cents, which is less than 1. If someone were willing to ""dump"" his ticket for say, 50 cents, what you paid would be less than the expected value, and over enough ""trials,"" you would make a profit. Warren Buffett used to say that he would never buy a lottery ticket, but would not refuse one given to him free. Thats the ultimate ""discount.""

Is short selling a good hedging strategy during overzealous market conditions?,"The problem with short would be that even if the stock eventually falls, it might raise a lot in the meantime, and unless you have enough collateral, you may not survive till it happens. To sell shares short, you first need to borrow them as naked short is currently prohibited in US, as far as I know. Now, to borrow you need some collateral, which is supposed to be worth more that the asset you are borrowing, and usually substantially more, otherwise the risk for the creditor is too high. Suppose you borrowed 10K worth of shares, and gave 15K collateral numbers are totally imaginary of course. Suppose the shares rose so that total cost is now 14K. At this moment, you will probably be demanded to either raise more collateral or close the position if you can not, thus generating you a 4K loss. Little use it would be to you if next day it fell to 1K  you already lost your money! As Keynes once said, Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.

"Options for dummies. Can you explain how puts  calls work, simply?","Put options are contracts to sell. You pay me a fee for the right to put the stock or other underlying security in my hands if you want to. That happens on a specific date the strike date and a specified price the strike price. You can decide not to exercise that right, but I must follow through and let you sell it to me if you want to. Put options can be used by the purchaser to cap losses. For example You purchase a PUT option for GE Oct19 13.00 from me. On October 19th, you can make me let you sell your GE stock to me for 13.00 a share. If the price for GE has fallen to 12.00, that would be a good idea. If its now at 15.00 a share, you will probably keep the GE or sell it at the current market price. Call options are contracts to buy. The same idea only in the other direction You pay me a fee for the right to call the stock away from me. Calls also have a strike date and strike price. Like a put, you can choose not to exercises it. You can choose to buy the stock from me on the strike date for the strike price, but I have to let you buy it from me if you want to. For example You purchase a CALL option for GE Oct19 16.00 option from me. On October 19th, you can buy my GE stock from me for 16.00 a share. If the current price is 17.50, you should make me let you buy if from me for 16.00. If its less than 16.00, you could by it at the current market price for less. Commonly, options are for a block of 100 shares of the underlying security. Note this is a general description. Options can be very complicated. The fee you pay for the option and the transaction fees associated with the shares affects whether or not exercising is financially beneficial. Options can be VERY RISKY. You can loose all your money as there is no innate value in the option, only how it relates to the underlying security.

Events that cause major movement in forex?,"Anything related to the central bank will have a large impact, as they are the ones who determine interest rates, and interest rates have a big effect on currency flows. GDP is also important, as when there is an economic slowdown it may result in the central bank reducing rates to boost economic activity. The opposite is also true, large increases in GDP may mean that an interest rate hike might be needed. Inflation data is also very important. Again, large changes in inflation either way may push the central bank towards changing rates. This data typically is in the form of CPI Note that each central bank is different. They all have specific mandates and specific pieces of economic data that they place emphasis on. The Federal Reserve as of late has closely been watching inflation data, especially wage inflation data, and employment. Significant deviations in these data points from whats expected by investors can greatly move the market. However, these specific factors are a little less important for, say, Mexico, which is mostly concerned with headline inflation. Read the statements issued by the central banks to find out whats important to them. Central banks also issue expectations for things like growth, CPI, etc. If these expectations are not met, it may result in a policy change, or at least talk of a policy change, at the next meeting of the central bank.

How to save money for future expenses,"My answer will suck but it comes from someone who has been married You cant control another person or convince them to do something. What you can do is identify what they value and show how saving money increases their opportunities in what they value, but understand that the person could see what youre saying as invalid too. If youre single and reading this, this is why you verify that the person has similar values to you. Think of it like someone who wants good gas mileage you show them a car that gets 60MPG, and immediately they say, ""Well, but thats not a cool car."" So their value isnt the miles per gallon, and you may find the same is true with your spouse. India is paying more interest than the US and Europe in their savings accounts I believe the benchmark interest rate is 7.5, so  assuming your spouse values more money  showing him how to use money in savings to passively earn money might be a technique that works. But it may mean nothing to him because its 1 not his actual value or 2 isnt enough to matter in his mind. In other words, this is all sales and whatever you do and this is regardless of gender, dont manipulate, as in the long run that tends to build resentment. If there is a specific problem that you know he sees as a major issue and saving money can help, Id recommend showing how savings would help with that problem. People generally like solutions to problems just remember, what you think he sees as a problem may not be what he sees as a problem. This is why I chuckle when I see single people give married people advice you cant just ""convince the person enough"" because you are not that person we have to speak their language and we should be careful to avoid creating resentment. The part that sucks or doesnt depending on who you ask is that if we cant convince others to do it, we should do it ourselves.

Are Forex traders forced to use leverage?,"It isnt that the companies force traders, it is more the other way around. Traders wouldnt trade without margin. The main reason is liquidity and taking advantage of minor changes in the forex quotes. It goes down to pips and traders make profitloss on movement of pips maybe by 1 or 2 and in some cases in 11000 or less of a pip. So you need to put in a large amount to make a profit when the quotes move up or down. Supposedly if they have put in all the amount upfront, their trading options are limited. And the liquidity in the market goes out of the window. The banks and traders cannot make a profit with the limited amount of money available at their disposal. So what they would do is borrow from somebody else, so why not the broker itself in this case maybe the forex company, and execute the trades. So it helps everybody. Forex companies make their profit from the fees, more the trades done, more the fees and hence more profit.

Do stock option prices predicate the underlying stocks movement?,"Options reflect expectations about the underlying asset, and options are commonly priced using the BlackScholes model Nd1 and Nd2 are probability functions, S is the spot current price of the asset, K is the strike price, r is the risk free rate, and Tt represents time to maturity. Without getting into the mathematics, it suffices to say that higher volatility or expectation of volatility increases the perceived riskiness of the asset, so call options are priced lower and put options are priced higher. Think about it intuitively. If the stock is more likely to go downwards, then theres an increased chance that the call option expires worthless, so call options must be priced lower to accommodate the relative change in expected value of the option. Puts are priced similarly, but they move inversely with respect to call option prices due to PutCall parity. So if call option prices are falling, then put option prices are rising Note, however, that call prices falling does not cause put prices to rise. The inverse relationship exists because of changes in the underlying factors and how pricing works. So the option action signifies that the market believes the stock is headed lower in the given time frame. That does not mean it will go lower, and option traders assume risk whenever they take a particular position. Bottom line gotta do your own homework!

Do common stocks and preferred stocks have any differences in terms of percentage of the company per unit they represent?,"Typically, preferred shares come with one or both different benefits  a disproportionate share of votes, say 10 votes per share vs the normal 1, or a preferred dividend. The vote preference is great for the owners looking to go public, but not lose control of the company. Say, I am a Walton of Walmart fame and when I went public, I sold 80 of the 1000 share total company. But, in creating the share structure, 20 of shares were assigned 10 votes each. 800 shares now trade with 800 votes, 200 shares have 10 votes each or 2000 votes. So, there are still the 1000 shares but 2800 votes. The 20 of shares now have 20002800 or 71 of the total votes. So, my shares are just less than half ownership, but over 78 of votes. Preferred dividend is as simple as that, buy Stock A for ownership, or same company Stock A preferred shares which have ownership and 1yr dividend. Edited to show a bit more math. I use a simple example to call out a total 1000 shares.

Issuing bonds at discount  computing effective interest rate,"If the market rate and coupon were equal, the bond would be valued at face value, by definition. Not 100 true, but this is an exercise, and that would be tangent to this discussion. Since the market rate is higher than the coupon rate, the value I am willing to pay drops a bit, so my return is the same as the market rate. This can be done by hand, a time value of money calculation for each payment. Discount by the years till received at the market rate to get the present value for each payment, and sum up the numbers. The other way is to use a finance calculator and solve for rate. The final payment of 10,000 ignore final coupon just now is 10,0001.15. In other words, that single chunk of cash is worth 10 less if its one year away, 1.12 if 2 years away, etc. Draw a timetable with each payment and divide by 1.1 for each year its away from present.

"As a 22yearold, how risky should I be with my 401k investments?","At 22 years old, you can afford to be invested 100 in the stock market. Like many others, I recommend that you consider low cost index funds if those are available in your 401k plan. Since your 401k contributions are usually made with each paycheck this gives you the added benefit of dollar cost averaging throughout your career. There used to be a common rule that you should put 100 minus your age as the percentage invested in the stock market and the rest in bonds, but with interest rates being so low, bonds have underperformed, so many experts now recommend 110 or even 120 minus your age for stocks percentage. My recommendation is that you wait until you are 40 and then move 25 into bonds, then increase it to 40 at 55 years old. At 65 I would jump to a 5050 stockbonds mix and when you start taking distributions I would move to a stablevalue income portfolio. I also recommend that you roll your funds into a Vanguard IRA when you change jobs so that you take advantage of their low management fee index mutual funds that have no fees for trading. You can pick whatever mix feels best for you, but at your age I would suggest a 5050 mix between the SP 500 large cap and the Russell 2000 small cap.

What is the best use of spare money?,"With 40 of your takehome available, you have a golden opportunity here. Actually two, and the second builds out easily from the first. Golden Opportunity  1 Layoff Immunity Ok, not really immunity. Most people dont think of themselves getting laid off, and dont prepare. Of course it may not happen to you, but it can. Its happened to me twice. The layoff itself is an emotional burden getting rejected is hard, but then youre suddenly faced with a gutwrenching, ""how am I gonna pay the rent????"" If you have no savings, its terrifying. Put yourself in that spot. Imagine that tomorrow, youre out of a job. For how many months could you pay your expenses with the money you have? Three months? One? Not even that? How about shooting for 12 months? Its really, really comforting to be able to say ""I dont have to worry about it for a year"". 12 months saved up gives you emotional and financial stability, and it gives you options  you dont have to take the first job that comes along. Now, saving 12 months of expenses is huge. But, youre in the wonderful spot where you can save 40 of your income. It would only take 2.5 years to save up a years worth of income! But, actually, its better than that. Because your 12month Layoff Immunity fund doesnt have to include the amount for retirement, or taxes, or that 40 were talking about. Your expenses are less than 60 of takehome  youd only need 12 months of that. So, you could have a fully funded 12Month Layoff Immunity Fund only in a year and a half! Golden Opportunity 2 Freedom Fund Do you like your Job? Would you still do it, if you didnt need the money? If so, great. But if not, why not get yourself into a position where you dont need it? That is, build up enough money from saving and investing to where you can pay your expenses  forever  from your investments. The number to keep in mind is 25. Figure out your annual expenses, and multiply it by 25. Thats the amount youd need to never need a job again. That works out to a 4 withdrawal rate, adjusting for inflation every year, with a low risk of running out of money. Its a rule of thumb, but smart people doing a lot of math worked it out. Here you keep saving and investing that 40 in solid mutual funds in a regular, taxable account. Between your savings and the compounding returns off the investments, you could easily have a fully funded ""Freedom Fund"" by the time youre 50. In fact, by 45 isnt unreasonable. It could be even better. If you live in that highrent area because of the job, and wouldnt mind living were the rents are lower once you quit, your target amount would be lower. Between that, working dedicatedly toward this goal, and maybe a little luck, you might even be able to do this by age 40. Final Thoughts There are other things you could put that money toward, like a house, of course. The key takeaway here, is to save it, and invest it. Youre in a unique position of being able to do that with 40 of your income. Thats fabulous! But dont think its the norm. Most people cant save that much, and, once you lose the ability to save that much, its very difficult to get it back. Expenses creep in, lifestyle ""wants"" become ""needs"", and so on. If you get into the habit of spending it, its very difficult to shrink your lifestyle back down  down to what right now youre perfectly comfortable with. So, spend some time figuring out what you want out of life  and in the mean time, sock that 40 away.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What is the best use of spare money?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

What is the difference between a scrip dividend and a stock split?,"Firstly a stock split is easy, for example each unit of stock is converted into 10 units. So if you owned 1 of the company before the stock split, you will still own 1 after the stock split, but have 10 times the number of shares. The company does not pay out any money when doing this and there is no effect on tax for the company or the share holder. Now onto stock dividend When a company make a profit, the company gives some of the profit to the share holders as a dividend this is normally paid in cash. An investor may then wish to buy more shares in the company using the money from the dividend. However buying shares used to have a large cost in broker charges etc. Therefore some companies allowed share holders to choose to have the dividend paid as shares. The company buys enough of their own shares to cover the payout, only having one set of broker charges and then sends the correct number of shares to each share holder that has opted for a stock dividend. Along with any cash that was not enough to buy a complete share. This made since when you had paper shares and admin costs where high for stock brokers. It does not make sense these days.

"Evidence foragainst negative correlation between commodity futures, stocks","The correlation I heard most about in economicsfinance was that stock prices and bond yields were negatively correlated as the stock market does better, bond yields fall companys doing well as evidenced by stocks, so its a good credit risk, so YTM of its bonds on the market goes down. The correlation, if any, between the stock and futures market should be visible in the actual price histories. Index prices may be useful, but whats more likely is that various future prices have correlation with various companies stocks. Where the future reflects the price of a raw material that is a significant cost of goods sold for a company, youll see these two move inversely to each other in the short term. I think that if there is a causative relationship here, its that futures prices influence stock prices, not the other way around. The futures market generally represents the cost side of a consumer goods producers bottom line. The stock market represents its profits. As futures go up, profit expectations go down, putting pressure on stock prices. Industries that deal in services, or in other types of goods, can still be affected because a rise in the cost of something consumers need will cause them to spend less on other things which affects margins in those other areas. So, in the short and medium term, when the futures market goes up the stock market sees a dip, and vice versa. However, companies adapt they can put upward pressure on prices for their goods to restore their desired margins, usually by slowly increasing them to prevent sticker shock though elasticity of demand plays a part the more we need something no matter what it costs, the faster prices can increase. To maintain costs, they can make things cheaper using less expensive materials more plastic, less steel. They can restructure production processes translated move factories offshore, or at least to ""righttowork"" states with less union strength to save costs elsewhere. All of these reduce costs and thus increase profits, but take time to implement. Many of these things reduce direct costs, reducing demand for the commodity and causing the futures prices to go back down.

Oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing,"I am a firm believer in the idea of limiting debt as much as possible. I would not recommend borrowing money for anything other than a reasonably sized mortgage. As a result, my recommendations are going to be geared toward that goal. The top priorities for me, then, would be to make sure, first, that we dont have to go further into debt, and second, that we eliminate the debt that we already have as soon as possible. Here is how I would rate your list A small emergency fund, perhaps 1000 USD, is going to ensure that, while you are funding other things, you dont end up so cash poor that, if something unexpected and urgent comes up, you are forced to add to your credit card debt. Make this small fund your top priority, and it shouldnt take much more than a month or two to do it. Getting out of debt is important, but if your employer hands out free money, you have to take it. It is just too good of a deal. Get rid of this debt as fast as possible. When you are done, youll have more income available to you than youve ever had before. Now that you have just gotten done eliminating your debt as fast as possible, dont stop there. Take the income you had been throwing at your debt, and build up your emergency fund to a few months worth of your expenses. Finishing this fund up will enable you to withstand a small crisis without borrowing anything. You are now in a very strong position financially, and can confidently invest. Deciding which type of retirement account is best for you depends on the details of your situation. Once you are contributing a healthy amount to your retirement funds, you may want to consider paying off your mortgage early. As I said before, I recommend getting down to the last step as quickly as possible. Depending on how much debt you actually have, if you sacrifice for a year or two you could be debt free and in a position to keep all of your investment gains. If you take your time paying off debt, like many people do, you could find yourself 10 years from now still making payments on your loans, still making car payments, and still needlessly sending interest to the banks, eating away at the gains you are making in your investments. If you arent committed to eliminating your debt quickly, and plan on having payments for a long time, then skip this advice and put retirement savings at the top.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Oversimplify it for me the correct order of investing?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

"What exactly is a bad, standard, or good annual raise? If I am told a hard percentage and dont get it, should I look elsewhere?","TLDR You will probably need to move to a different employer to get the raise you wantneeddeserve. Some employers, in the US, punish longevity through a number of practices. My wife worked as a nurse for about 20 years. During that time she had many employers, leveraging raises with job changes. She quit nursing about 6 years ago and was being paid 38hour at the time. She had a friend that worked in the same system for 18 years. They had the same position in the same hospital that friends current rate of pay 26hour. You probably dont want to be that person. Given your Stack Overflow participation, I would assume you are some type of web developer. I would recommend updating your resume, and moving for a 20 increase or more. Youll get it as it is a great time to be a web developer. Spending on IT tends to go in cycles, and right now budgets are very healthy for hiring new talent. While your current company might not have enough money in the budget to give you a raise, they would not hesitate hiring someone with your skills at 95K if they had an opening. Its common, but frustrating to all that are involved except the bean counters that looks at people like us as commodities. Think about this both sides of the table agree that you deserve a 5K raise. But lets say next year only 3k is in the budget. So you are out the 5k you should have been given this year, plus the 2k that you wont get, plus whatever raise was fair for you next year. That is a lot of money! Time to go! Dont bother on holding onto any illusions of a counter offer by your current employer. There will be too much resentment. Shake the dust off your feet and move on. Edit Some naysayers will cite short work histories as problems for future employment. It could happen in a small number of shops, but short work histories are common in technology that recruiters rarely bat an eye. If they do, as with any objection, it is up to you to sell yourself. In Cracking the Code Interview the author cites that no one is really expecting you to stay beyond 5 years. Something like this would work just fine ""I left Acme because there were indications of poor financial health. Given the hot market at the time I was able to find a new position without the worry of pending layoffs."" If you are a contractor six month assignments are the norm. Also many technology resumes have overlapping assignments.

Multiple hard inquiry for a single loan from car dealer?,"This is normal with the dealers financing.

Investment strategy for a 20 year old with about 30k in bank account,"You dont state a long term goal for your finances in your message, but Im going to assume you want to retire early, and retire well.  any other ideas Im missing out on? A fairly common way to reach financial independence is to build one or more passive income streams. The money returned by stock investing capital gains and dividends is just one such type of stream. Some others include owning rental properties, being a passive owner of a business, and producing goods that earn longterm royalties instead of just an immediate exchange of time  effort for cash. Of these, rental property is probably one of the most wellknown and easiest to learn about, so Id suggest you start with that as a second type of investment if you feel you need to diversify from stock ownership. Especially given your association with the military, it is likely there is a nearby supply of private housing that isnt too expensive so easier to get started with and has a high rental demand so less risk in many ways. Also, with our continued current low rate environment, now is the time to lockin long term mortgage rates. Doing so will reap huge benefits as rates and rents will presumably rise from here though that isnt guaranteed. Regarding the idea of being a passive business owner, keep in mind that this doesnt necessarily mean starting a business yourself. Instead, you might look to become a partner by investing money with an existing or startup business, or even buying an existing business or franchise. Sometimes, perfectly good business can be transferred for surprisingly little down with the right deal structure. If youre creative in any way, producing goods to earn longterm royalties might be a useful path to go down. Writing books, articles, etc. is just one example of this. There are other opportunities depending on your interests and skill, but remember, the focus ought to be on passive royalties rather than trading time and effort for immediate money. You only have so many hours in a year. Would you rather spend 100 hours to earn 100 every year for 20 years, or have to spend 100 hours per year for 20 years to earn that same 100 every year? .... All that being said, while youre way ahead of the game for the average person of your age 30k cash, 20k stocks, unknown TSP balance, low expenses, Im not sure Id recommend trying to diversify quite yet. For one thing, I think you need to keep some amount of your 30k as cash to cover emergency situations. Typically people would say 6 months living expenses for covering employment gaps, but as you are in the military I dont think its as likely youll lose your job! So instead, Id approach it as ""How much of this cash do I need over the next 5 years?"" That is, sum up X for the car, Y for fun  travel, Z for emergencies, etc. Keep that amount as cash for now. Beyond that, Id put the balance in your brokerage and get it working hard for you now. I dont think an average of a 3 div yield is too hard to achieve even when picking a safe, conservative portfolio. Though you do run the risk of capital losses if invested. Once your total portfolio TSP  brokerage is 100k or more, then consider pulling the trigger on a second passive income stream by splitting off some of your brokerage balance. Until then, keep learning what you can about stock investing and also start the learning process on additional streams. Always keep an eye out for any opportunistic ways to kick additional streams off early if you can find a low cost entry.  The 100k number is admittedly a rough guess pulled from the air. I just think splitting your efforts and money prior to this will limit your opportunities to get a good start on any additional streams. Yes, you could do it earlier, but probably only with increased risk lower capital means less opportunities to pick from, lower knowledge levels  both stock investing and property rental also increase risk of making bad choices.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Investment strategy for a 20 year old with about 30k in bank account?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Highrisk investing is better for the young? Why?,"The reason that you are advised to take more risk while you are young is because the risk is often correlated to a short investment horizon. Young people have 4050 years to let their savings grow if they get started early enough. If you need the money in 515 years near the end of your earning years, there is much more risk of a dip that will not correct itself before you need the money than if you dont need the money for 2540 years someone whose career is on the rise. The main focus for the young should be growth. Hedging your investments with gold might be a good strategy for someone who is worried about the volatility of other investments, but I would imagine that gold will only reduce your returns compared to smallcap stocks, for example. If you are looking for more risk, you can leverage some of your money and buy call options to increase the gains with upward market moves.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Highrisk investing is better for the young?

Is a total stock market index fund diverse enough alone?,"Brendan, The short answer is no, there is no need to get into any other funds. For all intents and purposes the SP 500 is ""The Stock Market"". The news media may quote the Dow when the market reaches new highs or crashes but all of the Dow 30 stocks are included in the SP 500. The SP is also marketcap weighted, which means that it owns in higher proportion the big ""Blue Chip"" stocks more than the smaller less known companies. To explain, the top 10 holdings in the SP represent 18 of the total index, while the bottom 10 only represent 0.17 less than 1 percent. They do have an equal weighted SP in which all 500 companies represent only 1500th of the index and that is technically even more diversified but in actuality it makes it more volatile because it has a higher concentration of those smaller less known companies. So it will tend to perform better during up markets and worse during down markets. As far as diversification into different asset classes or other countries, thats nonsense. The SP 500 has companies in it that give you that exposure. For example, it includes companies that directly benefit from rising oil prices, rising gold prices, etc known as the Energy and Materials sector. It also includes companies that own malls, apartment complexes, etc. known as the Real Estate sector. And as far as other countries, most of the companies in the SP are multinational companies, meaning that they do business over seas in many parts of the world. Apple and FaceBook for example sell their products in many different countries. So you dont need to invest any of your money into an Emerging Market fund or an Asia Fund because most of our companies are already doing business in those parts of the world. Likewise, you dont need to specifically invest into a real estate or gold fund. As far as bonds go, if youre in your twenties you have no need for them either. Why, because the SP 500 also pays you dividends and these dividends grow over time. So for example, if Microsoft increases its dividend payment by 100 over a ten year period , all of the shares you buy today at a 2.5 yield will, in 10 years, have a higher 5 yield. A bond on the other hand will never increase its yield over time. If it pays out 4, thats all it will ever pay. You want to invest because you want to grow your money and if you want to invest passively the fastest way to do that is through index ETFs like the SPY, IVV, and RSP. Also look into the XIV, its an inverse VIX ETF, it moves 5x faster than the SP in the same direction. If you want to actively trade your money, you can grow it even faster by getting into things like options, highly volatile penny stocks, shorting stocks, and futures. Dont get involved in FX or currency trading, unless it through futures.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Is a total stock market index fund diverse enough alone?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Should I Use an Investment Professional?,"Let me start with something you might dismiss as trite  Correlation does not mean Causation. A money manager charging say, 1, isnt likely to take on clients below a minimum level. On the other hand, theres a long debate regarding how, on average, managed funds dont beat the averages. I think that you should look at it this way. People that have money tend to be focused on other things. A brain surgeon making 500Kyr may not have the time, nor the inclination to want to manage her own money. I was always a numbers person. I marveled at the difference between raising 1.1 to the 40th power, getting 45.3 i.e. Getting 45.3 times your investment after 40 years at 10 vs 31.4 at 9. That 1 difference feels like nothing, but after a lifetime, 13 of your money has been skimmed off the top. the data show that one can do better by simply putting their money into a mix of SP index and cash, and beat the average money manager over time, regardless of convoluted 12 asset class allocations. Similarly  There are people who use a tax guy. In quotes because I mean this as an individual whom they go to, year after year, not a storefront. My inlaws used to go to one, and I was curious what they got for their money. Each year he sent them a form. 3 pages they needed to fill in. Every cell made its way into the guys tax program. The last year, I went with them to pick up the tax return. I asked him if he noticed that they might benefit from small Roth conversions each year, or by making some of their IRA RMD directly to charity. He kindly told me ""Thats not what we do here"" and whisked us away. I planned both questions in advance. The Roth conversion was a strategy that one could agree made sense or dismiss as convoluted for some clients. But. The RMD issue was very different. They didnt have enough Schedule A deductions to itemize. Therefore the 3000 they donated each year wasnt impacting their return. By donating directly from their IRAs, this money would avoid tax. It would have saved them more than the cost of the tax guy, who charged a hefty fee, in my opinion.

"Oh, hail. Totaled car, confused about buyback options","It seems like there are a few different things going on here because there are multiple parties involved with different interests. The car loan almost surely has the car itself as collateral, so, if you stop paying, the bank can claim the car to cover their costs. Since your car is now totaled, however, that collateral is essentially gone and your loan is probably effectively dead already. The bank isnt going let you keep the money against a totaled car. I suspect this is what the adjuster meant when he said you cannot keep the car because of the loan. The insurance company sounds like theyre going to pay the claim, but once they pay on a totaled car, they own it. They have some plan for how they recover partial costs from the wreck. That may or may not allow you or anyone else to buy it from them. For example, they might have some bulk sale deal with a salvage company that doesnt allow them to sell back to you, they may have liability issues with selling a wrecked car, etc. Whatever is going on here should be separate from your loan and related to the business model of your insurance company. If you do have an option to buy the car back, it will almost surely be viewed as a new purchase by the insurances company and your lender, as if you bought a different car in similar condition.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Oh, hail.

"Why can we cancel cheques, but not Western Union transfers?","When you send money with Western Union, it is essentially a cash transaction. You supply Western Union with the name of the recipient and a location. Your recipient then shows up at a Western Union office, shows some identification, and receives cash.

This is the reason why you might want to legitimately use Western Union. It is an instant way to send cash to anyone anywhere in the world. Lets say that your best friend is stuck in a foreign land and desperately needs money. You can give him cash just as fast as each of you can get to a Western Union office, and you dont even need a local bank account to do so.

By ""people,"" I dont mean individual buyers of 100 shares like you or me, but typically large institutional investors like Fidelity, who might buy millions of shares at a time. Or if youre talking about a human person, perhaps someone like Warren Buffett.

"How to spend more? AKA, how to avoid being a miser","There was a study last year  it was all over the news  that concluded that experiences, not stuff, is what makes people happy. The satisfaction from going on vacation lasts even after the holiday is long over. That new gadget only gives fleeting satisfaction. To that end, I recommend splurging on the affordable luxuries that give you a better experience. For example, Im a big believer in paying the skycap a few dollars to check my bags at the curb rather than wait in line at the airport because I HATE airports. Valet parking is another affordable luxury when the alternative is circling a busy parking lot for 15 minutes. Pay for the better seats at the show. Get a room at the nicer hotel.

"Where should my money go next savings, investments, retirement, or my mortgage?","Theres a ton of great advice here. Its very challenging to come up with something that hasnt already been suggested. Im curious to know how many years you have left to pay down the mortgage at the regular rate of payment. If its more than 15 years, it might be worthwhile to consider refinancing your mortgage to a shorter term 15 years or even 10 years if your income supports it. Rates on fixedinterest mortgages at those terms are down in the 3 range and lower at least according to bankrate.com. Refinancing to a shorter term would be another way of paying off your home faster with fewer of those dollars going toward interest payments. If youve got fewer than 15 years left to pay off your mortgage, following any of the other advice youve received here should keep you in great financial shape.","What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Where should my money go next savings, investments, retirement, or my mortgage?",This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do people always talk about stocks that pay high dividends?,"It has little to do with money or finance. Its basic neuroscience. When we get money, our brains release dopamine read Your Money and Your Brain, and receiving dividends is ""getting money."" It feels good, so were more likely to do it again. What you often see are rationalizations because the above explanation sounds ... irrational, so many people want to make their behavior look more rational. Ceteris paribus a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends. In valueinvesting terms, dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low ""underpriced"". However, as you realize, you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same, assuming youre using a free brokerage like Robin Hood. You can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a ""stream of cash"" like dividends. That presents no problem whatsoever, so this cannot be the explanation to why some people think it is ""smart"" to be a dividend investor. Yes, if youre using a brokerage like Robin Hood there may be others, but I think this is the only one right now, then you are right on.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Why do people always talk about stocks that pay high dividends?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Helping girlfriend accelerate credit score improvement,"This is an all too common problem and is not easy to resolve. Divorce agreements do not alter prior mortgage contracts. Most importantly, the bank is not required, and will not normally, remove the girlfriend from the mortgage even if she quitclaimed it to her Ex. If he has abandoned the property there is a good chance he will not make any more future payments. She should be prepared to make the payments if he doesnt or expect her credit to continue to deteriorate rapidly. She needs to contact her divorce attorney to review their mutual obligations. A court can issue orders to try to force the Ex to fulfill the divorce agreement. However, a court cannot impose a change to the mortgage obligations the borrowers made to the bank. Focus on this. Its far more important than adding her to a car loan or credit card. Sorry for the bad news. As for the car loan, its best to leave her off the loan. You will get better terms without her as a joint owner. You can add her as an additional driver for insurance purposes.

The cost of cleaning the house that we rented far exceeds the security deposit. Should we bother?,"I am surprised at the amount of work this contract wants done. Id question if its even legal given the high costs. I suspect its only there to remind abusive tenants of responsibilities they already have in law for extraordinary abuse beyond ordinary wearandtear they are already on the hook to repaint if they trash the paint think child writing on walls, happens a lot, and already need to fumigate and a lot more if they are a filthtype hoarder who brings in a serious infestation happens a lot. The landlord can already go after these people for additional money beyond the deposit. But thats not you. So dont freak out about those clauses, until you talk to the landlord and see what hes really after. Almost certainly, he really wants a ""fit and ready to rent"" unit upon your departure, so he doesnt have to take the unit off the market for months fixing it. As long as thats done, theres no reasonable reason for further work  a decent landlord wouldnt require that. Nor would a court, IMO. The trouble with living in a place for awhile is you become blind to its deficiencies. Whats more, its rather difficult to ""size up"" a unit as ready when its still occupied by your stuff. A unit will look rather different when reduced to a bare room, without furniture and whatnot distracting you. Add to it a dose of vanity and it becomes hard to convince yourself of defects others will easily see. So, tread carefully here. If push comes to shove, first stop is whether its even legal. Cities and states with heavy tenant populations tend to have much more detailed laws, and as a rule, they favor the tenant. Right off the bat, in most states the tenant is not responsible for ordinary wearandtear. In my opinion, 6 years of ordinary, exempt wear would justify a repaint, so that shouldnt be on the tenant at all. As for the fumigation, Im not in Florida so I dont know the deal, maybe theres some special environmental issue there which somehow makes that reasonable, it sure wouldnt fly in CA. Again that assumes youre a reasonable prudent tenant, not a slob or hoarder. As for the pro carpet cleaning, thats par for the course in any of the tough rent control areas Ive seen, so thats gotten a pass from the legislators. Though 600 seems awfully high. Other than that, you can argue the terms are ""unconscionable""  too much of a raw deal to even be fair. However, this will depend on the opinion of a judge. Hit or miss. Im hoping your landlord will be happy to negotiate based on the good condition of the unit which he may not know landlords rarely visit tenant units unless they really need to. You certainly should make the case that you make here that the work is not really needed and its prohibitive. Your best defense against unconscionable deals is dont sign them. Remember, you didnt know the guy when you initially signed... the nowobjectionable language should have been a big red flag back then, saying this guy is epic evil, run screaming. even if that turned out not to be true, you shouldt have hung around to find out. You may have gotten lucky this time, but dont make that mistake again. Unless one of the above pans out, though... a deal is a deal. You gave your word. The powerful act here is to keep your word. Forgive me for getting ontological, but successful people say it creates success for them. And heres the thing. You have to read your contracts because you cant keep your word if you dont know what word you gave. Its a common mistake thinking good business is trust, hope, faith, submission or giving your all. No. In business, you take the time to hammer out mutually beneficial winwin agreements, and you set them on paper to eliminate confusion, argument and stress in the future as memories fade and conditions change.

Brief concept about price movement of a particular stock [duplicate],"The problem with predicting with accuracy what a stock price will do in any given situation is that there are two main factors that affect a stocks price. The first factor is based somewhat in math as it takes into account numbers such as supply and demand, earnings per share, expected earnings, book value, debt ratio and a wide variety of other numbers. You can compile all those numbers into a variety of formulas and come up with a rational estimate of what the stock should sell for. This is all well and good and if the market were entirely rational it would rarely make news because it would be predictable and boring. This is where our second factor throws a wrench in the works. The second factor affecting stock price is emotional. There are many examples of peoples emotions affecting stock price but if you would like a good example look up the price fluctuations of Apple AAPL after their last couple earnings reports. Numerically their company looks good, their earnings were healthy, their EPS is below average yet their price fell following the report. Why is that? There really isnt a rational reason for it, it is driven by the emotions behind unmet expectations. In a more general sense sometimes price goes down and people get scared and sell causing further decline, sometimes people get excited and see it as opportunity to buy in and the price stabilizes. It is much more difficult to anticipate the reaction the market will have to peoples emotional whims which is why predicting stock price with accuracy is near impossible. As a thought along the same line ask yourself this question if the stock market were entirely rational and price could be predicted with accuracy why is there such a wide range of available strike prices available in the options market? It seems that if stock price could be predicted with anything remotely reassembling accuracy the options market need a much smaller selection of available strike prices.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Brief concept about price movement of a particular stock [duplicate]?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

JCI headache part 2 How to calculate cost basis  tax consequences of JCI  ADNT spinoff?,"I am using the same logic as the two answers above. I got almost the same result 46.60 instead of 46.59 per share using the sold fractional share basis. However, the JCI Qualified Dividend on the 1099DIV, not the 1099B divided by the number of shares spun off yields a basis per share of only 40.97 That compares to 45.349 in answer two above. It seems that we should get the approximately same basis per share using the same arithmetic, and I do not know why we dont. For my tax files, I plan to use the Adient basis equal to the dividend from the 2016 1099DIV of JCI the PLC after the merger. My reasoning is that I cannot use an amount for the Adient basis that is greater than the dividend I paid taxes on.

What does 100 stock dividend mean?,"Simply put, 100 stock dividend is 11 or 1 for 1 bonus share, as explained above, if you held 100 shares after 11 bonus you would have 200 shares 100 original, another 100 as bonus.

When do I pay taxes if Im self employed?,"I strongly recommend that you talk to an accountant right away because you could save some money by making a tax payment by January 15, 2014. You will receive Forms 1099MISC from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you. A copy will go to the IRS also. You file a Schedule C with your Form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099MISC forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received e.g. amounts less than 600 for which a 1099MISc does not need to be issued, or tips, say, if you are a taxidriver running your own cab, and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income, including tools, books, or gasoline! etc that you bought for doing the job. You will need to file a Schedule SE that will compute how much you owe in Social Security and Medicare taxes on the net income on Schedule C. You will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employees share but also the employers share. At least, you will not have to pay income tax on the employers share. Your net income on Schedule C will transfer onto Form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe, and then add on the Social Security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid. You will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013, plus interest on the tax paid late. Send the IRS a check for the total. If you talk to an accountant right away, heshe will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe, and sending in that amount by January 15 will save some money. The accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: When do I pay taxes if Im self employed?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Taxing GoFundMe Donations,"Im going to post this as an answer because its from the GoFundMe website, but ultimately even they say to speak with a tax professional about it. Am I responsible for taxes? US Only While this is by no means a guarantee, donations on GoFundMe are simply considered to be ""personal gifts"" which are not, for the most part, taxed as income in the US. However, there may be particular, casespecific instances where the income is taxable dependent on amounts received and use of the monies, etc.. Were unable to provide specific tax advice since everyones situation is different and tax rules can change on a yearly basis. We advise that you maintain adequate records of donations received, and consult with your personal tax adviser. Additionally, WePay will not report the funds you collect as earned income. It is up to you and a tax professional to determine whether your proceeds represent taxable income. The person whos listed on the WePay account and ultimately receives the funds may be responsible for taxes. Again, every situation is different, so please consult with a tax professional in your area. httpssupport.gofundme.comhcenusarticles204295498AmIresponsiblefortaxesUSOnly And heres a blurb from LibertyTax.com which adds to the confusion, but enforces the ""speak with a professional"" idea Crowdfunding services have to report to the IRS campaigns that total at least 20,000 and 200 transactions. Money collected from crowdfunding is considered either income or a gift. This is where things get a little tricky. If money donated is not a gift or investment, it is considered taxable income. Even a gift could be subject to the gift tax, but that tax applies only to the gift giver. NonTaxable Gifts These are donations made without the expectation of getting something in return. Think of all those Patriots fans who gave money to GoFundMe to help defray the cost of quarterback Tom Bradys NFL fine for Deflategate. Those fans arent expecting anything in return  except maybe some satisfaction  so their donations are considered gifts. Under IRS rules, an individual can give another individual a gift of up to 14,000 without tax implications. So, unless a Brady fan is particularly generous, his or her GoFundMe gift wont be taxed. Taxable Income Now consider that same Brady fan donating 300 to a Patriots business venture. If the fan receives stock or equity in the company in return for the donation, this is considered an investment and is not taxable . However, if the business owner does not offer stock or equity in the company, the money donated could be considered business income and the recipient would need to report it on a tax return. httpswww.libertytax.comtaxloungetwotaxrulestoknowbeforeyoutrykickstarterorgofundme",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Taxing GoFundMe Donations?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Why do people build a stock portfolio if one could get a higher return from bank interest than dividend per annum?,Stock prices arent constant they rise and fall. The overall return on a share is the combination of the dividends paid plus the change in value of the share. Some companies pay no dividend at all yet investors still buy their shares because they believe the share price will rise. People invest in stocks because they believe that the overall return will exceed what they can get from cash in the bank. As to options they do offer higher potential profits but they also offer higher potential losses. Different investors have different appetites for risk.

"Merchant dispute with airline over missed flight, and which credit cards offer protection?","What you are looking for is travel insurance. I have never heard of this being offered as a credit card perk, but there might be something out there. You can buy this separately, but only you can decide if it is worth the costs. To me, it would seem to only be worth it for something quite expensive, like a cruise that costs thousands of dollars. The more you travel, the less likely it is to be worth it, since at some point the cost of one canceled trip is less than the insurance paid on the rest of the trips that went through fine. As a frequent traveller, I recommend that you build some flexibility into your plans, especially during the winter. It is not always possible, but try not to need to be somewhere the day of or the day after your flight. Try to book flights early in the day, as they are less likely to be delayed by problems in flights before them, and you have more options for rebooking. Flight delays due to weather and mechanical problems are not uncommon, and with generally full flights it is sometimes hard to be rebooked in a reasonable amount of time. Finally, be nice to the gate agents and other airline personel. In general, they arent any happier about delays than you are flight crews want to get home too and dont have any power over weather or mechanical delays. Being rude to them will not help, and will make them less likely to go out of their way to find a solution.

Can I buy stocks directly from a public company?,"Yes, you often can buy stocks directly from the company at little or no transaction cost. Many companies have either a Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRIP or a Direct Stock Plan DSP. With these plans, you purchase shares directly from the company although, often there is a third party transfer agent that handles the transaction, and the stock is issued in your name. This differs from purchasing stock from a broker, where the stock normally remains in the name of the broker. Generally, in order to begin participating in a DRIP, you need to already be a registered stockholder. This means that you need to purchase your first share of stock outside of the DRIP, and get it in your name. After that, you can register with the DRIP and purchase additional shares directly from the company. If the company has a DSP, you can begin purchasing shares directly without first being a stockholder. With the advent of discount brokers, DRIPs do not save as much money for regular investors as they once did. However, they can still sometimes save money for someone who wants to purchase shares on a regular basis over even a discount broker.

How can I buy and sell the same stock on the same day?,"If youre going to be a day trader, you really need to know your stuff. Its risky, to say the least. One of the most important elements to being successful is having access to very fast data streams so that you can make moves quickly as trends stat to develop in the markets. If youre planning on doing this using consumergrade sites like eTrade, thats not a good idea. The web systems of many of the retail brokerage firms are not good enough to give you data fast enough for you to make good, timely decisions or to be able to execute trades way that day traders do in order to make their money. Many of those guys are living on very thin margins, sometimes just a few cents of movement one way or the other, so they make up for it with a large volume of trades. One of the reasons you were told you need a big chunk of money to day trade is that some firms will rent you out a ""desk"" and computer access to day trade through their systems if youre really serious about it. They will require you to put up at least a minimum amount of money for this privilege, and 25k may not be too far out of the ballpark. If youve never done day trading before, be careful. It doesnt take much to get caught looking the wrong way on a trade that you cant get out of without losing your shirt unless youre willing to hold on to the stock, which could be longer than a day. Day trading sounds very simple and easy, but it isnt. You need to learn about how it works a good book to read to understand this market is ""Flash Boys"" by Michael Lewis, besides being very entertaining, because it is a space filled with very sophisticated, wellfunded firms and individuals who spend huge sums of money to gain miniscule advantages in the markets.

What are the contents of fixed annuities?,"An annuity is a contract. Its contents are ""a contractual obligation from the issuing company"". If you want to evaluate how your annuity is likely to fare, youre essentially asking whether or not its issuer will honor its contract. Theyre legally required to honor the contract, unless they go bankrupt. Even if they do go bankrupt, you will be a creditor and may get a portion of the assets recovered by the bankruptcy process. Generally, the issuer will take the proceeds and invest them in the stock market or possibly in similar instruments  e.g. BerkshireHathaway bought a railroad and invests some money in it directly. They invest in these places because thats where the returns are. One of the reason that annuities may have a good rate on paper is that they may end up taking some of your principal, because many are structured as some form of survivors insurance policy. Consider If youre 65 years old and have some retirement savings, youd like to be able to spend them without fear of them running out because you live longer than you expected e.g. you survive to your 90s. So, you could invest in the stock market and hope for a 7 return indefinitely and then plan to spend the returns  but if those returns dont materialize for a few years because theres a big stock market crash, youre in big trouble! Or, you could buy an annuity contract which will pay you 7 a year or more! until you die. Then youre guaranteed the returns unless the issuer goes bankrupt. Sure, you lose all your principal, but youre dead, so hey, maybe you dont care. The insurance company essentially sells risktolerance. Other annuities arent structured like this, and may be marketed towards nonretirees. Theyre usually not such a good deal. If they appear to be such a good deal, it may be an illusion. Variable annuities in particular are hard to reason about without a good deal of knowledge about how the stock market behaves on a yeartoyear basis many of them have a maximum return as well as a minimum, and the stock market may pile up a lot of its returns into one year, so after a ""crash and recovery"" cycle you might end up behind the market instead of ahead. Annuities are a form of safety. Safety can be very expensive. If youre investing your own money, consider whether you need that safety. You probably neednt worry quite so much about the issuer being crazyfraudulent or Ponziesque you should worry mostly about whether it looks better on paper than it is.",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: What are the contents of fixed annuities?,This question requires a tailored strategy.

Does Apple have 0 of treasury stock?,"Treasury stock is not really represented in the Balance Sheet as a ""Treasury stock"" line item in the assets. Some companies will break out Treasury Shares as a line item in the ""Shareholders Equity"" heading of the balance sheet but Apple hides it in the ""Shares Issued and Outstanding"" counts under the ""Shareholders Equity"" heading. As of the most recent Q2 2017 quarterly report There are 5,205,815,000 shares issued against 5,336,166,000 shares outstanding. This indicates that Apple is retaining about 130,351,000 shares in treasury. On the Q1 10Q you can see that Apple had 5,255,423,000 shares issued which indicates roughly 49mm shares were repurchased by the end of Q2. You can roughly verify this by looking at page 18 of the Q2 filing in the summary of the share repurchase program. Repurchased as part of an Accelerated Share Repurchase arrangement bleeds between quarters but from February 2017 through May 2017 there have been 17.5mm shares repurchased. 31mm shares were also repurchased on the open market in Q2.

Other taxes, such as foreign real and personal property taxes, do not qualify. But you may be able to deduct these other taxes even if you claim the foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes.

Pay for a cheap car or take out a loan?,"This was a huge question for me when I graduated high school, should I buy a new or a used car? I opted for buying used. I purchased three cars in the span of 5 years the first two were used. First one was 1500, Honda, reliable for one year than problem after problem made it not worth it to keep. Second car was 2800, Subaru, had no problems for 18 months, then problems started around 130k miles, Headgasket 1800 fix, Fixed it and it still burnt oil. I stopped buying old clunkers after that. Finally I bought a Nissan Sentra for 5500, 30,000 miles, private owner. Over 5 years I found that the difference between your ""typical"" car for 1500 and the ""typical"" car you can buy for 5500 is actually a pretty big difference. Things to look for Low mileage, one owner, recent repairs, search google known issues for the make and model based on the mileage of the car your reviewing, receipts, clean interior, buying from a private owner, getting a deal where they throw in winter tires for free so you already have a set are all things to look for. With that said, buying new is expensive for more than just the ticket price of the car. If you take a loan out you will also need to take out full insurance in order for the bank to loan you the car. This adds a LOT to the price of the car monthly. Depending on your views of insurance and how much youre willing to risk, buying your car outright should be a cheaper alternative over all than buying new. Save save save! Its very probably that the hassles of repair and surprise break downs will frustrate you enough to buy new or newer at some point. But like the previous response said, you worked hard to stay out of debt. Id say save another grand, buy a decent car for 3000 and continue your wise spending habits! Try to sell your cars for more than you bought them for, look for good deals, buy and sell, work your way up to a newer more reliable car.

What percent of my salary should I save?,"I disagree with the selected answer. Theres no one rule of thumb and certainly not simple ones like ""20 cents of every dollar if youre 35"". Youve made a good start by making a budget of your expected expenses. If you read the Mr. Money Mustache blogpost titled The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement, you will understand that it is usually a mistake to think of your expenses as a fixed percentage of your income. In most cases, it makes more sense to keep your expenses as low as possible, regardless of your actual income. In the financial independence community, it is a common principle that one typically needs 2530 times ones annual spending to have enough money to sustain oneself forever off the investment returns that those savings generate this is based on the assumption of a 7 average annual return, 4 after inflation. So the real answer to your question is this UPDATE Keats brought to my attention that this formula doesnt work that well when the savings rates are low 20 range. This is because it assumes that money you save earns no returns for the entire period that you are saving. This is obviously not true investment returns should also count toward your 25times annual spending goal. For that reason, its probably better to refer to the blog post that I linked to in the answer above for precise calculations. Thats where I got the ""37 years at 20 savings rate"" figure from. Depending on how large and small x and y are, you could have enough saved up to retire in 7 years at a 75 savings rate, 17 years at a 50 savings rate, or 37 years! at the suggested 20 savings rate for 35year olds. As you go through life, your expenses may increase eg. starting a family, starting a new business, unexpected health event etc or decrease kid wins full scholarship to college. So could your income. However, in general, you should negotiate the highest salary possible if you are salaried, use the 25x rule, and consider your life and career goals to decide how much you want to save.

Why do people invest in mutual fund rather than directly buying shares?,"How on earth can you possibly know what is going on in individual company X? The sole exception is if it is your own company. The stock markets of the world are in fact a nest of sharks. The big sharks essentially make money out of the little sharks. Some little sharks manage not to be eaten, and grow bigger. Good luck with that. ""Insider trading"" is, when found out, a crime these days. But ""insider knowledge"", ""insider hints"", ""knowledge of market sentiment"" and indeed just rumours about a given company are the kinds of things you wont particularly get to hear of in the fog of disinformation, and dont particularly want to waste your time with for a very uncertain loss or gain at the end of the year. The thing I find annoying about mutual funds is that they can be very stupid, and I speculate that it may be the consequence of the marketing on the one hand, and the commission structure on the other. I started cashing in my funds in late 2007, following the collapse of Northern Rock here in the UK. The ""2008"" crisis was in fact the slowest economic car crash in history. But very very few mutual funds saw, or seemed to see, the way the wind was blowing, and switch massively to cash. If the punters had the courage to hang on, of course, mostly stocks bounced back in 2009 and 2010.

Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment?,"Theres a difference between missing a payment and ""carrying a balance"" making an ontime payments that are less than the full balance due. I have heard mortgage brokers claim that, if you have no other credit history, carrying a small balance here and there on a credit card may improve your score. ""Small"" is in relation to your available credit and your ability to pay it off. But actually missing a payment will probably hurt your score. Example You have a card with a credit limit of 1000. In July you charge 300 worth of stuff. You get the next statement and it shows the balance due of 300 and a minimum payment of 100. If you pay the entire 300 balance in that cycle, most cards wont charge you any interest. You are not carrying a balance, so the credit scores may not reflect that you actually took a 300 loan and paid it off. If you instead pay 200, youll be in good standing because 200 is greater than the minimum payment. But youll be carrying a 100 balance into the next statement cycle. Plus interest will accrue on that 100. If you do this regularly, your credit score will probably take into account that youve taken a small loan and made the payments. For those with no other credit history, this may be an appropriate way to increase your credit score. But youre paying interest, so its not free. And if the average balance you carry is considered high relative to your ability to pay or to the total credit available to you, then this could adversely affect your score or, at least, the amount of credit another provider is willing to extend to you. If you instead actually miss a payment, or make a payment thats less than the minimum payment, that will almost certainly hurt your credit score. It will also incur penalties as well as interest. You want to avoid that whenever possible. My guess is that, in the game of telephone from the banker to you, the ""carrying a balance"" was misinterpreted as ""missing a payment.""",What are the specific considerations and implications related to: Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment?,This question requires a tailored strategy.
